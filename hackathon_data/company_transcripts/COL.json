Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and our reconciliation to the related GAAP measure. Please note, today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, thanks Ryan and good morning, everyone. Well, I\u2019m pleased to report that for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2014. We delivered strong financial results, growing our top line sales by 12% with the addition of ARINC, and delivering total segment operating earnings of 20%.","And for those of you who participated in our Investor Conference last month, these results are inline with the strategies that we laid out. And let me give you just a brief recap of those strategies. ","As we look to accelerate growth and increase share owner value of the Company, we are focusing our efforts in four primary areas; the first is leveraging our new Information Management Services growth platform. The second, capitalizing on market share gains with new OEM platforms entering service. Third, expanding our international business, and fourth, positioning our government business for the new defense environment. And I\u2019m pleased to say, that for this quarter we\u2019ve made progress in all fronts. ","As you know one of our biggest growth drivers is our acquisition of ARINC. And we came out of the shoots really strong with 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% EBTIDA margins for the quarter. Our integration plan is on track and I remain encouraged by this synergy capture opportunities we are seeing that will help us to lever the accelerated levels of growth we expect from this business in terms of sales, earnings and cash flows.","And while we are on the subject of Information Management, I want to take a moment to highlight this significant agreement, we\u2019ve recently signed with the Inmarsat to provide Ka-broadband service to the commercial aviation markets. This agreement will allow Rockwell Collins to continue to build-out our broad offering of connectivity services to meet our customers growing information needs. This deal would not have been possible without ARINC, and it\u2019s just one example of the way this acquisition is already paying off.","During the quarter we also achieved a number of important milestones on new OEM programs in both our commercial and government markets. For example, the A350 program continues to progress towards entry into service and our equipment is performing very well in the flight test and that supports our plan to begin deliveries later this year. ","At Embraer, we deliver the first Pro Line Fusion systems for the Brazilian Air Force KC-390 program and we\u2019re finishing up the flight test program on the Legacy 500 business jet. I\u2019m pleased to say that our avionics are in good shape to support the Legacy 500s entry into service later this summer. Again, this supports our plan to see some benefit from deliveries yet in our fourth quarter. ","We also achieve certification of the Avionics onboard the AgustaWestland\u2019s AW189 helicopter, including our new HeliSure family of situation awareness products. Again, this supports our plan for full scale production deliveries in the second half of this fiscal year. And just last week, Bombardier achieved the first flight of the Lear 85 equipped with a full suite of our Pro Line Fusion avionics.","This is just one of more than a dozen new aircraft equipped with Pro Line Fusion scheduled to enter service over the next five years and while, this critical milestone did occur a little later than we all had hoped. It\u2019s an important indicator that the program continues to make progress, and it will be an important growth engine for us in the out years of our plan. ","It\u2019s very encouraging to see all these investments we\u2019ve made in these programs beginning to payoff. While it\u2019s taken a little longer than we have planed in a few cases, I remained confident that our strong positions on these and other programs will continue to fuel growth in the years ahead.","Now on the International front, we continue to make good progress against our goal of growing our International business to 50% of our overall revenues in the next five years. ","Highlights for the quarter include the selection of our Flight2 avionics systems with the Mexican Air Force C-130 upgrade program, selection of our latest Fixed Site Ground radio for the Indian Air Force, and we delivered our first HF radios to Helibras down in Brazil, marking first radios that we manufactured and delivered out of our Brazilian facility, and this is a part of our overall strategy that increased our footprint in this growing market.","In addition, our Information Management Services team signed a five year contract to place our Common Use Passenger Processing Systems in all four common use terminals at the London Heathrow airport. This is a significant win for us in one of the world\u2019s busiest airports. ","Earlier this month, I was in China, where we broke ground on our new facility as part of our commercial flight simulation joint venture with Beijing Bluesky Aviation Technology that JV is called ACCEL and it\u2019s targeted at the growing China simulation market.","We also have the grand opening of our communication and navigation joint venture with CETC Avionics, which is initially focused on the COMAC C919 aircraft, but we\u2019re also expand to address additional opportunities in China. These JVs will play a critical role in allowing us to continue to grow our business in this emerging China aerospace market and it\u2019s fundamental to our overall growth strategy in our international port upfront.","Now before I turn the call over to Patrick, to walk through the financials. Let me briefly address what\u2019s going on in our end markets. We now had time to come through the details of the U.S. defense budget and I\u2019m pleased to say that our programs have faired pretty well. While some have been funded at lower levels than originally anticipated, there has been no outright program cancellations and you may recall that one of our watch items was the KC-10 upgrade program. And I\u2019m pleased that this program was funded and we\u2019re now working to finalize the contract to support the balance of our fiscal 2014 sales plan.","The other watch item was the JTRS Manpack radios and that also appears to be well supported in the budget. In business aviation as expected, we had a soft quarter as the rate reductions we saw in the latter half of last year continue to play through particularly at the low-end. And then finally, the air transport market continues to remain strong with good OEM growth driven by delivery to the 787. ","In addition, our Buyer Furnished Equipment capture rates are in line with our long-term plans. And was supported by some recent awards from American Airlines, AirAsia and SilkAir for our new MultiScan ThreatTrack weather radar, which we just introduced. I\u2019m really pleased to see that take up in the market. We had another, other airline avionics awards that will continue to support our growth in that region.","And overall, our commercial aftermarket continues to track to our mid-single digit guidance. So, in summary this was a solid quarter for us, demonstrating that our teams are executing to our plans to accelerate growth and increase shareholder value. And just as important I like the way we\u2019re doing it. In March, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as one of 2014\u2019s Most Ethical Company. The award recognizes organizations that continue to raise the bar in ethical leadership and corporate behavior. And this is the fifth consecutive year we\u2019ve been recognized for this award. We were one of only three companies in A&D space to be honored this year. ","I think it demonstrates the integrity and dedication of our people and our management team, and is yet another reason why I\u2019m confident about the future of Rockwell Collins So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to take you through the financial details of the quarter. ","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I\u2019d now like to walk you through today\u2019s presentation slides that summarize our results of the second quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3, but we highlight our total company\u2019s second quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. Total company\u2019s sales for the quarter increased to $141 million or 12%, compared to second quarter of 2013 sales. The second quarter sales do include $137 million of ARINC revenue. ","Although, income from continuing operations and earnings per share both declined compared to second quarter last year. The decrease resulted from differences in the availability of the Federal Research & Development Tax Credit. Prior year results included a $31 million benefit or $0.22 per share, but in the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit, which once again expired on December 31, 2013. Excluding the difference in the tax rate year-on-year, earnings per share would\u2019ve increased 9%.","As we turn to Slide 4, note that we have reclassified sales leading to our legacy flight services business, previously included in commercial systems to our new information management services segment. Sales related to our flight services were about $11 million in the second quarter of last year. ","With that said, personal systems achieved revenue of $536 million in the quarter, up 3% from $542 million in the second quarter of 2013. Aftermarket sales increased $9 million or 4% to $221 million due to higher services to support sales and regulatory Airspace mandates.","Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $5 million or 2% to $317 million primarily due to increased leverage for Boeing 787 aircraft, partially offset by lower deliveries of light business jets. ","Now Commercial Systems operating earnings increased 9% to $127 million in the second quarter of 2014 with operating margins expand to go 140 basis points from 21.4% to 22.8%. The increase in operating earnings and margins was due to higher sales, lower R&D expenses and cost saving initiatives. ","Moving to Slide 5, Government Systems revenues decreased by 2% to $567 million in the second quarter driven by lower satellite communication sales as troop deployments wind down in the Middle East as well as lower development program sales. These headwinds were partially offset by increased hardware deliveries on both domestic and international programs.","Now looking specifically at our product categories. Sales of Avionics $9 million or 3% from higher deliveries of the E-6B aircraft upgrade program as well as increases from a number of international programs. However, these increases were partially offset by lower KC-46 and KC-10 development program sales. ","Communication Product sales declined $20 million or 13% primarily due to lower satellite communication sales as fewer terminals were delivered and service revenues declined due to troop deployments winding down in the Middle East. Surface Solutions and Navigation Product sales were about flat in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. ","Government Systems second quarter operating earnings decreased $3 million to $109 million resulting in an operating margin of 19.2% compared to the 19.4% in the second quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted to the lower sales volume. ","Now turning to Slide 6, you see our new segment Information Management Services which include ARINC as well as our legacy flight services business. During the second quarter, ARINC contributed $137 million of revenue and the flight services business contributed $12 million of revenue. On a pro forma basis, Information Management Services sales increased 13% driven by strong growth in commercial and business aviation sales. ","Operating earnings for Information Management Services were 12.1% in the second quarter. And ARINC\u2019s standalone adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter was 20% consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings release. ","Looking next to Slide 7, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $63 million of operating cash flow compared to $179 million last year. The decreased cash generation resulted from $69 million in higher income tax payments, $60 million in higher employee incentive compensation pay, and other working capital changes partially offset by $54 million in lower pension plan contributions. ","Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment through the second quarter of the year. During the first six months of the year, total spend decreased from $464 million to $451 million. Company funded R&D declined $10 million due to reduction in R&D efforts on various next-generation business jet avionics development programs.","Customer funded R&D declined $16 million due to development programs winding down in Government Systems. Pre-production engineering investment on the other hand increased due to higher spend on the Boeing 737MAX and Bombardier C-Series and Global 7000\/8000 development programs. Looking to the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $950 million in total R&D.","Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. The first quarter, we issued a $1.1 billion of long-term debt, approximately $900 million of which was used for the ARINC acquisition and the remainder was used to refinance $200 million of our debt that matured in December. The balance of the ARINC acquisition was funded with commercial paper and we currently plan to pay down the bulk of that commercial paper balance over the course of the next couple of years.","At the end of fiscal 2013, we had a debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9%. With the issuance of long-term debt and the incremental commercial paper in the first quarter to fund the acquisition we are currently at about 2.3%. I believe this level of debt still allows us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs and I expect it to improve over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally results later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the second quarter, we repurchased 475,000 shares at an average cost of $81.57, which brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 87 million shares or $4.3 billion to share owners. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $356 million.","Now on to Slide 11, where we\u2019ve provided the details of our updated fiscal year 2014 financial guidance. We have updated our earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.55 per share from the previous range of $4.35 to $4.55. The improvement at the bottom end of the range is due to lower than previously estimated intangible asset amortization for ARINC. Based on this improvement we now expect ARINC\u2019s operating margin to be in the range of 11% to 12%, up from the previously guided range of 9% to 10%. We continue to estimate ARINC\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin to be about 20% of sales. ","All other areas of the financial guidance for fiscal year 2014 are unadjusted from amounts previously provided in our first quarter earnings call. Sales are expected to be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.05 billion with ARINC sales in the range of $400 million to $430 million. Total segment operating margins are estimated to be in the range of 20% to 21%.","Our outlook for operating cash flow continues to be $600 million to $700 million and total R&D investment is estimated $950 million and capital expenditures are estimated at $160 million.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further question simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we\u2019ll answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Thank you very much. You\u2019ve talked about some of the progress you\u2019ve made in ARINC, Kelly, could you elaborate a little bit more? I mean, clearly the Inmarsat win is one example. What other initiatives do you have underway? Are there some apps or some other items you might be able to talk about?","Robert K. Ortberg","","Well, Howard, we talked about kind of short-term and long-term synergies when we had our Investor Day. We\u2019re making good progress in some of the short-term, which if you recall, are really just leveraging our channel, bringing Rockwell Collins and ARINC capability and we\u2019ve seen new tails or new customers added to both our ARINC Direct and our Ascend flight support services in business aviation. So I feel really good about that. I\u2019ll also tell you that we\u2019ve got a number of new pursuits and proposals that are going in to provide integrated solutions with our equipment and connectivity. So I\u2019m feeling very, very good about that.","Now, as far as the longer term synergies, those are the things that are going to take some time and we\u2019re in the project definition phase on some of those to define what applications and what development work needs to be done. So those will take a little bit longer, but I\u2019m really encouraged with the short-term nature of it and obviously the first quarter results are encouraging here too, because it came out pretty strong without those synergies.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. ","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes. So your R&D sort of run rate was lower than the $950 million you talked of for the year. You said about $950 million in the guide. I mean, it kind of looks like you would come in towards the lower end of that and also particularly commercial R&D kind of looks like it\u2019s running at a lower rate. Where would you expect that to come in for the year because it kind of looks like it\u2019s going to be down a fair amount?","Robert K. Ortberg","What I\u2019d say, Cai, is I think the trends for R&D are that we\u2019re going to be accelerating our company-funded R&D in the back half of the year, particularly in the commercial area as development programs progress. I think right now we\u2019re forecasting right in the neighborhood of $950 million. We maybe a few million short of that, but it\u2019s not going to be significantly short of $950 million. ","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","","And what does that assume about 777X?","Robert K. Ortberg","Not a lot of spending this year on 777X. We\u2019re currently in the process of figuring out what content we\u2019ll have on that and I don\u2019t anticipate a lot of engineering effort this fiscal year.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rober Stallard with RBC. Your line is open. ","Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning. ","Robert K. Ortberg","Good morning, Rob. ","Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Question on the guidance. It seems that you have quite a lot to do to hit your cash flow guidance, your free cash flow guidance for the full year and also your defense margin guidance. I was wondering what gives you the confidence you can get there and perhaps some of the risks that are still potentially threatening this number?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, Rob, as you know, our cash flow is very heavily weighted towards the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter. So I always share your concerns with respect to cash flow, but it always comes in. There is nothing I can see today that puts our cash flow at risk. I think we\u2019re going to hit that range of $600 million to $700 million.","As for the government margins, again government margins are depended somewhat on volume. The volume is going to pick up in the back half of the year and that should contribute to higher margins and will end up in that kind of 20% to 21% range.","Patrick E. Allen","Rob, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is the government margins are right in line with our plans. So we\u2019re not seeing anything that surprises us in terms of the operating performance there. ","Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. ","John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Pat, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about this amortization change impacting ARINC and specifically also how it affected the guidance revision. I guess I would have sort of thought that there would be a parallel shift up. It seems like it only affected the low end. I\u2019m not sure why it didn\u2019t affect the high end of guidance. If you could just sort of also offer some clarity on what it takes to hit the high-end versus the low-end and just to elaborate on that would be helpful to, thanks?","Patrick E. Allen","","The amortization expense for ARINC is really just the case of us working towards finalizing the valuation of those intangibles. And as we look at it, we see a very large intangible associated with customer relationships. ARINC has long-term customer relationships and as a result those customer relationships are amortized over a longer period of time, and that resulted in a reduction in the guidance. ","As it relates to the kind of the mechanics of the guidance range that reduction in amortization was about $5 million or around $0.03 a share. So the best way for us to incorporate that $0.03 was just to narrow our guidance range a little bit. And that\u2019s how we got from a, what is the midpoint of $4.45 to $4.48. And in terms of what it takes to hit that top end of the range, I\u2019d tell you probably, I think if ARINC continues to perform the way it performed in this quarter and if Government Systems surprises us on their top line I think we can get to the top end of the range.","John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Really helpful, thanks a lot.","Patrick E. Allen","","Sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC ","","Thanks good morning. Kelly, you\u2019ve mentioned that you guys were basically paging through the defense budget and while some programs were reduced in funding nothing was canceled. I was just wondering if you could, can you give a couple of examples, wondering if there is any more color you could provide and really very specifically as we look into next year. You guys have been saying for a while that you expect this to be the last down year, for government sales and next year to be flat, is that still what you anticipate?","Robert K. Ortberg","","Yes, that\u2019s what I still anticipate nothing in the budget submission that we\u2019ve gone through takes us away from that target. I would say the only other thing maybe to mention that where we did see, cuts that impact us are around the WIN-T program, the Army\u2019s network modernization that\u2019s up quite a few cuts. And that effects our Milsatcom business and our military comm portfolio. I think we\u2019d spike that out, it\u2019s an area that\u2019s been heavily impacted by the withdrawal from the Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the army.","So that\u2019s a little bit of a disappointment for us, but I think overall the rest of the portfolio, certainly our avionics, core comm and nav programs all look pretty good. So I think we\u2019ve forecasted it pretty well and we are sticking with flat in 2015.","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC ","","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC ","Kelly, just sticking with the military and the comms, you are only down about 2% on the revenue side in the first half of this year, guiding to a higher decline or a greater decline, for the full year. How do we think about the second half in terms of Government Systems revenue growth or rather decline?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, we\u2019ve got some programmatic timing, that\u2019s going to impact us in the second half. One of the big challenges we have is that if you recall the Manpack radio production Lot 2 award was delayed. We got that award, but we got it much later than anticipated which created a production break for us in the second half. ","So we\u2019ll be building Manpacks but in the third and a little bit of the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll go through a revenue decline on those as we deal with that. And then we are seeing some just some non-recurring timing from our tanker development programs coming down and a little bit of decline in the E-6 because we had a pretty strong fourth quarter last year in E-6 deliveries. So it\u2019s really just a kind of programmatic timing.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So was it double-digit decline 10%-12%, possible in H2? ","Robert K. Ortberg","","No, I think that\u2019s a little \u2013 that\u2019d be a little hot in terms of the decline.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, so your revenue guidance here \u2013 you\u2019re probably going to comment at the better end of what you are talking about?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, I\u2019m hopeful that certainly our government performance year-to-date is encouraging, so I\u2019m hopeful that there is some opportunity yet here as Pat kind of talked about in terms of getting to the top end of our guidance, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll see some continued good news the challenge we have is getting this stuff through their procurement cycle now. A good example is that KC-10 is funded, I don\u2019t have the contract yet. Guys are working hard to get the contract where you got sales in the fourth quarter with that. So we just got to get that stuff push through, if we are pretty successful then I think we\u2019ve got some upside opportunity on our government revenues. ","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay and then just on the aftermarket in commercial, you\u2019ve talked a mid-single digit can you parse that out between the spares and upgrades or mandates?","Patrick E. Allen","In terms of spares versus upgrades and mandates, I think there is probably not much growth related to this sparing activity in the quarter. I think when you look at your transport piece of the business. It\u2019s largely driven by upgrades, in mandates to a lesser extend. And business jets, we didn\u2019t see a lot of growth although we saw a nice sequential growth in the aftermarket. I\u2019d say that the issue with the business jet aftermarket growth was largely year-over-year comps because we had some pretty significant spares sales in the second quarter of last year.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Right, right thanks guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jonathan Raviv \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ","","Hi, good morning it\u2019s actually Jon Raviv on for Jason, thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Rob\u2019s question on aftermarket as one of you could parse the expected cadence out of those various aftermarket end market specifically business jet upgrades in the second half perhaps air space mandates in FY15. How do you see that flowing, you could receive better aftermarket perhaps next year as some of those regulations come online?","Robert K. Ortberg","","Well, we\u2019re not going to guide aftermarket right now for 2015, but I would expect to see that we\u2019ll have accelerating mandate related aftermarket in 2015. The one area that it\u2019s still pretty lumpy and questionable as the discretionary updates in the business aviation. We\u2019re seeing quite a bit a quoting activity but as we\u2019ve said in previous calls that\u2019s not really converting as much as we would like, so we\u2019re going to keep an eye. If there is any area of risk, it\u2019s around that discretionary business aviation upgrade.","Patrick E. Allen","And right now, the way we\u2019re looking at it is, business jet aftermarket is going to be strong relatively stronger in the second half. And actually air transport from a year-over-year perspective is going to be a little bit softer than we saw in the first half, just more due to comparables than anything else?","Robert K. Ortberg ","And then, remember that once we get A350 ramping up, we\u2019ll have all the entry into service of spares and service revenues that will provide some growth here in 2015 as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Hi, good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg ","Hi Noah.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I\u2019m staying in business jet and going off of that last comment were you mentioned, you\u2019re seeing a decent amount of quoting, but it\u2019s not converting as much as you\u2019d like. Can you tell how much of that is competition winning those quotes versus \u2013 the quotes just ultimately not happening?"," ","Robert K. Ortberg "," ","Yes. It\u2019s not our competition. In fact most of the quoting there is no competitive, it\u2019s like displaying up or updating one of our existing systems with a new capability or a new feature. So it\u2019s truly our decision of, do I want to put more money into the aircraft right now. And I would say no for that, the smaller the airplane, the softer the activity. ","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then in that smaller market, when does that legacy revenue that was a headwind in the quarter, when does that bottom-out, and then, are you hearing anything from the customer, the original equipment customer or seeing anything in the market to make you feel like that is starting to get a little better or not?","Robert K. Ortberg ","Well the legacy headwind is primarily Cessna and that will abate over the third and fourth quarter here. So, the first two quarters were the big headwinds because that\u2019s when they did their rate adjustments. And what we\u2019re hearing from the OEMs is that they are seeing a little activity, it\u2019s mostly around their new entry into service, new platforms as you recall at Cessna particularly, we\u2019re not on those, the N2 program is an example.","So we\u2019re not seeing anything that gives us any change in our view about the recovery of the low-end of business aviation is still pretty soft, and I don\u2019t see any change in rates for legacy products here soon.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Good morning. ","Robert K. Ortberg ","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit more just about commercial systems in total, and that maybe you can help me understand how you can have a quarter even with the restatement of sales up about $14 million and profits up about $11 million? What's the driver of that high incremental margin and I think an answer to a question earlier you talked about R&D, company funded R&D picking up in the second half and I\u2019m wondering how much of a driver that was in net incremental margin?","Patrick E. Allen","Sam. The way that I look at it is our R&D year-over-year Commercial Systems for the quarter was down about $4 million, if you adjust that piece of it out, we get right back to that about 30% incremental flow that we normally talk about. So, the R&D was about four of the causal and then the remainder was really good flow on incremental sales.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","There is no one time kind of initial provision expires or any short of shipment like that that\u2019s affecting it. ","Patrick E. Allen","No, no nothing significant.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.

Ortberg ","Hi Carter.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick kind of clarification on your comments around the procurement process, Kelly I just want to compass this out and see if there is any difference in contracting activity relative to what you expected, you called out a couple of those programs but I wonder if you might just kind of characterize, what that environment is like right now with the contracting officers and then the DoD compared to what you expect it to be at this time?","Robert K. Ortberg","","It\u2019s definitely improving. So this BBA and now that we\u2019ve got a budget, they\u2019re seeing what\u2019s going to be funded and so the paralysis of not knowing what is going to be funded, it\u2019s kind of behind us. So I gave an example of the KC-10. That\u2019s one that people were standing by, wondering what\u2019s going to be happen with that and so there was no procurement action moving forward for this to move to production to this mod.","Now that is funded, that\u2019s moving forward. So, I think the overall environment is improving. We just got some work to do to deal with the last six months of uncertainty now of becoming certain and pushing it through, and there is a lot of work to be done by a limited number of people within the procurement organization. So we are doing, everything we can do to help them be efficient.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.

Just wanted to ask if I've done the math right, it looks like you have to \u2013 given the pace of what you had the first two quarters, it looks like you have to have a meaningful drop in the second half. Just wanted to make sure that was consistent and you're on track for the $170 million.","Patrick E. Allen","I would say, yes your math is correct, Rich, and yes we are anticipating a slowdown in the differed spending and a shift to company funded R&D at the back-half of the year, could we end up a little bit higher than $170 million, yes we could, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be significant. "," ","Richard T. Safran \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","","Thanks very much.","Patrick E. Allen","Sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research, LLC","","Yes, Patrick, just based on what you are saying for the commercial margin adjusting for R&D, so I make the assumption at the incentive comp was comparable to last year, because last year had been particularly high in the second quarter, I figured around $39 million or so?","Patrick E. Allen","","What I would say George is that incentive compensation for the company was about $12 million lower this year than last year but that was largely offset unfortunately by other employee benefit costs particularly medical costs which we saw as higher than anticipated medical costs in this year\u2019s quarter which largely offset that benefit unfortunately.","George D. Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research, LLC","So if I look specifically at the incrementals in commercial I should adjust assume that the commercial lower incentive comp and commercial was offset by higher medical, so the incremental you just make the adjustment for R&D like you did and you come out with about 50%?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, that\u2019s right.","George D. Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research, LLC","","Okay thanks.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles A. Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks good morning, and Kelly I just wanted to do go back to the Inmarsat agreement and maybe tease a little bit with, is this is a move to expand into the passengers\u2019 side of commercial airline connectivity or is it augmenting your current offering within ARINC? And the business jet market, it seems like an awfully big pipe to be sending health and maintenance over. Just kind of curious on that front.","Robert K. Ortberg","Both miles and as you look into the future, the bigger the pipe you have, the more information you will move off it. Now that we are not going to move safety critical information. This is not a safety certified link. So it would be non-critical which would be cabin related things. But also operational related information that could go over this broadband link. So what I think you had a view at it, is this is going to be complementary to our portfolio. We\u2019ll continue to have all the air to ground safety service connectivity. Now we\u2019ll be able to add a new broader band link which I think is going to be heavily utilized in the future. So it\u2019s important to us.","Myles A. Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","","Okay and then one other one on that, front carriers could be on, it\u2019s Malaysian 370 and as you\u2019ve seen in the past or observed in the past, any thoughts on potential regulatory moves on data offloading and timing of that or if there is any thoughts around that area?","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes, we are in discussions with ICAO right now. As you are probably aware their putting together a Task Team to go address this issue and make sure it never happens again. They are driving towards a May meeting in which they kind of align the international community around their objectives and the plans that from my understanding is that at the end of that meeting May, they will identify the team that they selected to participate in that Task Force and that, what that Task Force will do is will kind of vet through all the potential solutions to this problem and come up with some recommendation. So I do see move upward to some sort of a mandated change here. And I hope to be a part of that Task Force, where we certainly have to think we\u2019ve got some good things to offer.","Myles A.

So in terms of Government Systems your forecast for the plan on next year in terms of sales. Can you give us some color how bookings are running year-to-date relative, no I guess on the year-over-year basis that back packs the view that you can get flattened next year.","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes, kind of related to the question around procurement activity. If I step back, overall our bookings in our Government business were actually a little ahead of our forecast, so I\u2019m pretty pleased with what the teams are doing now, recognize that\u2019s both domestic and international bookings, but there is nothing I see in terms of our pursuit node of capture. We are winning the programs that we need to win our capture rates or right in line with where we want them to be. So again I think that the business is there and we\u2019re capturing it to support that flat in 2015.","David E. Strauss \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay and Patrick. Product inventory there was another increase there. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and if you expect that would strengthen your cash flow guidance, if that actually comes down the back half of the year and where we are on the E-6 sale process. Thanks? ","Patrick E. Allen","As we reached the production inventory, we typically have our production inventory build in the first half of the year just due to kind of the timing of our sales volume we tend to level out the factory. And so we tend to have a buildup in the first couple of quarters and then a pretty rapid burn down in the back half particularly in the fourth quarter where we expect that pattern to continue and we expect production inventory to be relatively flat year-over-year when all is said and done.","As it relates to the ASES divestiture, I would say that the process continues, we hope to close on that before the end of our fiscal year and certainly anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to meet that timing.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord.

Herbert \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","","Hi, Kelly, just wanted to follow-up on one of your very first comments regarding international push there and it seems like you had a number of nice BFE announcements within the commercial transport sides, specifically with Asian carriers, I just wondered, if you can provide any more color on how you see the runway specifically within Asia those fleets continue to expand and this maybe the beginning of something, we should hear more about as part of your broader international push.","Robert K. Ortberg","","Well, we\u2019ve had very high capture rates in BFE in Asia over the last, I\u2019m going to say three, four years, and this is more of a continuation of that obviously a lot of the narrow body airplanes coming out of Boeing and Airbus, are going into that region. So every time there is an additional buy of aircraft then there is a competition for the BFE. We introduced a new radar here recently and that\u2019s what I was really highlighting is that we are very pleased to see the take-up of that new radar which is a pivotal, decision point around who is BFE an airline is going to select.","So yes, the Asia market remains, very good for us.

Your line is open.","","Kristine T. Liwag \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning it\u2019s actually Kristine Liwag, calling in for Ron today. Our question is a follow-up with the business jet discretionary upgrade you discussed earlier. Is that active quoting you\u2019ve been hearing because, owners are looking to refurbish their aircraft with an intention to sell. Or because maybe there the business jet owners intend to fly their jet longer and essentially, extend the useful life of the aircraft versus previous cycles?","","Robert K. Ortberg","","Yes, that\u2019s a good question, but I don\u2019t know the answer, too. We typically don\u2019t know, the psyche of the customer when they are asking for a quote on and we are going through a dealer network in many cases for those updates. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s \u2013 but my guess would be, it\u2019s probably a little of both, either modernizing the aircraft or upgrading because they are going to keep it a little longer. ","Let me just tell you what is the types of things that we are quoting, it\u2019s high definition audio, video upgrades for the cabining, it\u2019s additional display upgrades or new features and functions in the avionics. So both of them would provide value for resell of the aircraft. ","Kristine T.

So Kelly, you\u2019ve talked all about these international defense wins, how big was international as a percent of your government sales, I\u2019d estimate it about 29% and what sort of growth do you look for in fiscal 2014 and 2015 in your international government sales. Thanks. ","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes, you are right. It\u2019s around 28%, 29% and our forecasting that will grow to 35% over our five year plan. And that is a pretty linear growth across past those years. So you can kind of compute what that is mid-single digit kind of growth through the five year plan. ","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much. ","Operator","(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, just had a couple of follow-ups. The first one was just on back to Cessna. Patrick you said that I believe that the headwind this year is mostly behind you and that there is not going to be much of the headwind in the second half. But just as we think forward, could of that roughly $600 million business, since you\u2019re being displaced generally from their platforms as they refresh them. What is that the sales that you are generating in OE from Cessna. ","And then the second question is I just backed us Inmarsat, I am thinking bigger picture about passenger connectivity. Can you talk a bit since you\u2019ve announced essentially your strategy here? Could you frame Kelly how big this could be and maybe just get a little more context as to how you are thinking about the opportunity here from the financial standpoint over the next several years? ","Robert K. Ortberg","Let me address the latter and then I will let Patrick talk about the Cessna volume. So here is how I would think about the connectivity announcement is, I have talked about our growth in that information management business to be about high-single digit organic and double-digit if you include synergies. And that\u2019s what\u2019s in there, that\u2019s the kind of stuff that\u2019s in there. And that\u2019s the growth that it\u2019s going to create. So that gives you an order of magnitude of what this could be. ","Patrick E. Allen ","As it relates to Cessna\u2019s OEM sales Joe, because of the reduction in rates and because of the dynamics that Kelly outlined, right now it is less than 2% of total commercial system sales. So it\u2019s a \u2013 there is still very meaningful customer reports, but not significant. ","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and then just on the Inmarsat issue and the connectivity your value-added reseller, is this a business, is this is a revenue stream that can be high margin. Or is this a relatively lower margin, but lower margin \u2013 a sales driver but a low margin one? ","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, so we bundle it with our overall information management offering. So today we are a value-added reseller of Inmarsat, it\u2019s just not Ka-band. So when we go to the market with our airing direct in a sense, we sell connectivity services. And if it\u2019s satellite based then yes it\u2019s a value-added resale business. ","So in terms of profitability, the profitability is kind of all mixed in the \u2013 it\u2019s the applications, the service as well as the connectivity that all gets wrapped together in a contract. So I think it\u2019s a component, it\u2019s going to help us drive the kind of margins that we\u2019ve outlined for the business.","Joseph B.

Your line is open.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Yes. Just a follow-up to Joe\u2019s question. Patrick, could you rate down then the commercial sales in the business jet area between what we would consider low end, mid end and high end, a rough breakdown?","Robert K. Ortberg","Real rough breakdown, I would tell you, probably this time from a revenue perspective, we\u2019re out close to half at the high end of business jets. And then, the other half is split probably 30% kind of mid-size and 20% light-end, something of that magnitude. I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me, but that\u2019s how I think about it anyway.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Okay. And then just one quick, other one. When you mentioned to me before that medical costs were much higher this quarter and kind offset the lower incentive comp. Is that a trend that continues in subsequent quarters? So that\u2019s a headwind that you\u2019ll have to keep overcoming.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, we hope not. We made a change this year to a consumer-driven health plan and what we saw really towards the end of the calendar year, but it swapped into the first calendar quarter because there was a calendar year change, was a surge in claims, I think as people were preparing for the higher deductible consumer-driven plan. And so, we saw a large surge in claims over the course of the last couple of quarters. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s going to bait over the back half of the year, but when \u2013 any kind of change in medical plan you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019re going to get.

Ortberg","Let me answer the second part of that. They threaten to sequester that program out in the 2016 timeframe. So the contracts that we will get will be the initial modifications for the initial aircraft. They won\u2019t contract and their original plan was never to contract all of the aircraft in a one-shot mode. So this is the first tranche of aircraft and that\u2019s what we have in our plan.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Keena. And good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected due to certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I will turn the call over to Clay.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. Late last year, I characterized fiscal year 2013 as a year of transition. And this quarter's performance illustrates our progress along that journey. Our third quarter results once again demonstrate the kind of operating performance that this company is capable of delivering, even as we wait for overall revenue growth to return.","So let's start by looking at the sales results. Revenue came in as expected with 7% Commercial Systems growth, or most notably, our aftermarket increased 13%. That growth was offset by the anticipated decline in Government Systems of 11%, as the impact of sequestration particularly impacted some of our short-cycle products and order timing. Now the net effect was a 3% decline in revenue, which I believe will represent the low watermark in year-over-year percentage comparisons for both Government Systems and Rockwell Collins overall, with improvements beginning in our Q4.","Segment operating margin performance was exceptional across both businesses, expanding by 140 basis points up to 22.4% of sales. In Commercial Systems, operating margins were up 340 basis points to 23.4%, the third best quarterly margin rate we have ever posted for this business, rivaling the rates we saw in 2008.","In Government Systems, operating margins were 21.4%, down just 40 basis points, despite a dramatic sales decline, as the benefits of cost reduction actions were able to mostly offset the headwind from our lower revenue. Our ability to manage through a very dynamic market environment further demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our company's unique and balanced business model.","Now that performance allowed us to increase operating earnings by 3%. And with the benefits of our share repurchase program, we increased earnings per share by 5% to $1.20 a share. And as we've done throughout the year, we had another good quarter with cash flow well ahead of last year.","As we have seen almost continuously over the last 4 or 5 years, there are plenty of changes to note this quarter across our served markets. And let's first look at business jets, where at mid-quarter, we updated our guidance to incorporate the lower-than-expected production rates assessment. Even after incorporating these changes, we expect our FY '13 business and regional jet OE revenue to increase mid-single digits. Now that growth is really impressive considering our current expectations for overall business jet deliveries, including turboprops, is a 2% decline for 2013. Our strategic efforts over the last decade to better position the company with long-range and midsized business jets is driving the OEM revenue growth even as the light end of the market remains very soft.","Another area that has experienced a lot of volatility this year is the Commercial aftermarket. First, I will remind you that our aftermarket is a bit unique, as about 1\/2 is non-discretionary maintenance repair and overhaul, or MRO, while the other 1\/2 comes from discretionary activities like spares and retrofits.","At the beginning of the year, we plan for a very strong revenue growth across all portions of the aftermarket. Then last quarter, we reduced our guidance for the aftermarket based on weaker-than-expected MRO revenue. Even though the market has not performed to our original expectations, we believe that we now have a better understanding of the factors affecting service and support, and here's what we see.","Overall airline traffic is expected to be up about 4% this year at our estimate. However, the airlines are continuing to push the limits of efficiency with load factors running at historically high levels. This performance, coupled with an increasing quantity of new aircraft entering the market, is resulting in more aircraft retirements than our original expectations. We now expect over 500 aircraft retirements this year, which is creating a headwind for service and support as the older out-of-warranty aircraft are replaced by newer in warranty. Moreover, some of these retired aircraft are relatively new and are being torn down and sold for spares and for MRO purposes. This trend is clearly impacting our service and support revenue as well, and we expect it to continue for some time into the future.","Now the good news, in what is otherwise a negative development, is that we have a business called Intertrade, which deals exclusively in used aircraft components. Our Intertrade business is expected to grow more than 10% this year, providing some offset to the MRO trends I just described.","Now even with those MRO trends, we continue to expect increases in our discretionary aftermarket, specifically in spares, mandates and retrofits, which will drive the majority of the aftermarket growth for us this year.","Now I'd like to shift over to Government, where the question on everybody's mind is the implication of sequestration. About 1\/3 of our revenue decline this quarter is because of the implementation of these cuts. As you would expect, we continue to assess order activity anticipated over the balance of the year and compare that against our original estimates for sequestration. And the news is relatively good. If you remember, in our original guidance, we projected approximately $120 million of sequestration impact this year. Based on our most recent assessment, we now believe that the impact will be closer to $70 million, and now anticipate our defense revenue will be down 7% in FY '13 compared to our original guidance of 10%.","So based on our performance in the first 3 quarters, we remain confident that we will meet or exceed the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance and have increased our expectations for both earnings and cash flow toward the top end of the respective ranges. As we look ahead to the end of the year, I believe we will have effectively navigated this year of transition and taken the steps necessary to position the company for long-term growth.","With that, let me now hand the call over to Pat for a review of the financial results.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through to today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of 2013. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, EPS, net income and shares.","Total company sales for the quarter decreased 3% compared to last year's sales, while net income declined 1% to $164 million. Improved operating performance and the continued focus on returning capital to shareowners, earnings per share in the quarter increased $0.06 or 5% to $1.20.","Turning to Slide 4, we have the third quarter results of Commercial Systems, which achieved revenue of $563 million in 2013, up 7% from $526 million in 2012. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $14 million or 5% to $309 million, primarily resulted from increased deliveries for the Bombardier Global and Challenger aircraft, a full quarter of production of Beechcraft King Air turboprops. These were partially offset by fewer deliveries to Cessna.","Aftermarket sales increased $27 million or 13% to $235 million due to higher sales of spares in both the air transport and business jet markets, and increased mandate revenue. Commercial Systems had great earnings performance this quarter as its operating earnings increased 26% to $132 million, with operating margins expanding 340 basis points to 23.4%. The increase in operating earnings and margins were primarily due to higher sales volume and lower company-funded R&D expense.","Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems revenues decreased by 11% to $602 million in 2013. The reduction was due to the impacts of sequestration, mostly in our communication products, the completion of certain development programs, lower fighter jet-related sales and the reduction in GPS product sales. These headwinds were partially offset by increased sales in areas such as network communications and international sales.","Looking specifically at our product categories, sales of avionics decreased as expected by $52 million or 13%, driven by headwinds from development programs, simulator award delays and lower sales for fighter aircraft. Communication product sales declined $25 million or 14%, primarily due to fewer deliveries of satellite communication and data link products, partially offset by increased deliveries of JTRS Manpack radios.","Surface Solutions sales increased $12 million or 24% from increased international sales of FireStorm targeting systems. And finally, sales of navigation products declined by $12 million or 21%, resulting from fewer deliveries of our handheld GPS receivers.","Government Systems' third quarter operating earnings decreased $19 million to $129 million resulting in operating margins of 21.4%. The decreased operating earnings and margins resulted from lower sales volume, which was partially offset by the benefit from cost-reduction actions taken over the past year.","Looking to Page 6, we show year-to-date results for revenue, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we've generated $309 million of cash, compared to $192 million last year. The increased cash generation resulted from lower incentive compensation payments, as well as improved inventory performance and lower tax payments.","Slide 7 provides an update of our total R&D investment through the third quarter of the year. Total spend remained relatively consistent at 20.5% of sales. Company-funded R&D expense declined as we completed development efforts related to a certain next-generation business jet programs. Meanwhile, we increased investment in preproduction engineering programs, predominantly related to the Boeing 737 Max program.","Moving to Slide 8, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. In addition to $563 million of long-term debt, we had $602 million of short-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. The increase in short-term debt came from the issuance of commercial paper to fund share repurchases, as well as the reclassification of long-term debt that is due within the next 12 months.","Now we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 49% and debt-to-EBITDA of 1.1. I feel that this level of debt continues to provide us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs. And I do expect it to come down over the balance of the year, as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally results later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the third quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average cost of $63.72 per share, and we repurchased 7% of our outstanding shares over the past 12 months. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 85 million shares or $4.2 billion return to shareholders through maintaining an active share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $473 million remaining and we expect this authorization to fund our repurchases for the balance of 2013 and into 2014.","I'd like to turn now to our final slide, Slide 10, where we provide the details of our fiscal year 2013 financial guidance. As Clay outlined before, we are narrowing our guidance to the middle of our original sales guidance at $4.65 billion for the year and expect Commercial Systems to be up 5%, but we've actually increased our expectations for Government Systems and it will only be down about 7%. Based on operating cash performance to-date, we are increasing earnings per share expectations toward the top end of our range to between $4.55 and $4.60, and our cash flow guidance to be about $600 million.","Finally, we are slightly adjusting our expectations for capital spending for the year to $125 million from our original expectation of $140 million based on lower-than-expected spend through the first 3 quarters. All other aspects of our financial guidance remain unchanged.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So I'd now like to turn it back -- turn the call back over to Clay for some closing remarks.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Pat. Well as most of you know, this is my last earnings call before I retire in just a few days. At times like this, it's hard not to think back to the beginning of our journey as a new public company, which began 12 years ago this month. For all of us at Rockwell Collins, the summer of 2001 was filled with the excitement and optimism that usually accompanies an IPO. However, we had no idea how the world would change or impact our business starting just 10 weeks later on 9\/11, and frankly extending over the balance of the decade. I'll spare you the walk down memory lane and the associated war stories, but suffice it to say, these were interesting times that presented both opportunities and challenges that tested our company structure, judgment, leadership and resiliency.","Along the way, we had great successes, as well as a few disappointments. And I'll leave it up to you and history to judge the overall result. All I'll say is, we did the best we could to serve all our stakeholders and position this company for success no matter what cards we were dealt.","So let me close with 2 final thoughts. First, I want to thank all of you who invested both your time and your treasure in our company along the way. Unlike some CEOs, I actually enjoyed all, well, almost all of my interactions with analysts and investors. You've supported us, challenged us, made numerous suggestions and provided great insights, all of which helped make us a better company. And to those of you who have put your trust and money in Rockwell Collins, we are profoundly grateful and we'll always work to retain that trust.","Which leads to my final thought. I leave having never been more optimistic about the future of this company. It has secured great market positions that will be in an annuity for years to come. It is a financial stalwart with abundant flexibility to deploy capital in very value creating ways. It has a value system that prizes the highest standards of integrity and has demonstrated the kind of focus that puts customers and investors above self. And it is blessed with the quality of leadership that will ensure that we not only proceed full speed ahead through this transition, but we'll meet the inevitable future challenges with experience and resolve.","I have every confidence that Kelly Ortberg and his talented experienced team will take Rockwell Collins to new heights and ensure it achieves its full potential.","Thank you, all, for your support over the years. And with that, I'd like to open the Q&A session. So operator, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess my question is on defense and I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about Government Systems in terms of why you believe this is the low watermark in terms of what gets better. And related to it, in the past, at some of the conferences, you've talked about the down 5% to 10% next year. Now that you're going to end this year at a higher level, is that still how you're thinking about next year?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, first thing, I think the immediate fourth quarter is going to be better because of that 11% down, I'd say about $25 million of it was surely order timing that didn't come in as we had expected it to this third quarter, that we've already got the order and it's going to slip over into fourth quarter. If you were to normalize that, it would have been more like an equitable 7 7. So we have a little benefit actually from the delay that's going to help us next quarter, and that's what gives me confidence there. Relative to next year, obviously, it's way too early to call that because we still have a lot yet to learn and know about what the Pentagon is doing relative to sequestration, what both Houses of Congress are going to do relative to the '15 budget. But I think all in, well -- and I should say, heck, we call fourth quarter and I think that's pretty aggressive. But I'd say all in, what we do is we look at next year and I think the defense will still be down, but it won't be down at the level we saw this year. I really do believe that most of the lower-level supply chain folks, Tier 1, Tier 2 have taken a brunt of the cut so far. And eventually, we're going to see some of the major OEM cuts come through to resolve the budgets they have there. Now, no question, some of that will trickle down to us. But I don't think it will be any worse than it was this year, even if you calendarize it through the year. The second thing that gives me even more confidence is remembering this year of transition, we had probably about $100 million of headwind just from programs that are transitioning. Those programs, so far, are all still alive and seemed to enjoy a lot of support and they'll be moving from this transitionary period of finishing development, moving into production, and we'll see actually a tailwind for some portion of that. And so as I kind of look out to next year and frame it, I see some uppers, I see some natural downers. And so we've estimated sequestration, I think, as accurate as anybody has this year. And as we look at sort of what we think the general environment is for next year and what it's likely to be, that is the -- I will say, the macro view I'm basing that statement on. So yes, I think Government System will be down next year, not as much as it was down this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you talk a bit about R&D at a high level? Are we at the tail end of a long, long investment cycle and this is kind of the benefits we're going to reap or is there something related to timing here? Because if I look just isolated to company spend, it looks like the full year could be down $40 million year-on-year, $35 million to $40 million year-on-year, which is obviously better than you were anticipating at the start of the year. So is this a headwind for '14 or is this more efficient use of R&D?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I got some guys scrambling around the room to look and see if we can confirm or deny your estimate on the year. But while they're doing that, let me say that in my view, I think it's just a timing issue. Specifically, what we're seeing this quarter is a sort of a wind down of I'll say the product line, Pro Line Fusion work. It will still have a lot of R&D going in the application of Pro Line Fusion to the roughly 15 platforms we're working on. But that's a good portion of what the company funding is down. However, what we're seeing is a ramp-up of the Max funding. But remember, that's all deferred. And so total R&D spend this quarter actually went up, but it's just in 2 different buckets because of the reduction in this company discretionary or expensed R&D and the deferred R&D that's going into the new projects. I believe when you look at R&D all in, which is what we do, R&D will continue to be flat or a little bit increased, if the company is successful. If you look at the mix of R&D, you are seeing a decline in the discretionary portion and an increase this year and next in the deferred portion.","Patrick E. Allen","The other thing I'd add, Myles, is as we look kind of sequentially quarter-to-quarter, we are expecting to see an uptick in R&D on the Commercial side of the business, just really due to the timing of certain programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Safran, Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I've got a question on sort of on opportunities. So Boeing looks like it's set to launch the 777X later this year. I want to know if you could possibly discuss here what you might see as the incremental opportunities for share gains? For example, if Boeing were to go to an SFE model for the 777X, would you see that as a possible benefit to you?","Clayton M. Jones","I think it could be, Rich. It's probably premature for me to talk specifics about what the opportunities are, but if you look at our last 2 or 3 runs in the air transport competitions, we fared pretty well in picking up market share. So I like our chances just based on historicals. But on the 777, as I've said before on this call, a lot of it depends on what Boeing chooses to do, specifically with the avionics systems and there are 2 very distinct architectural approaches that they are studying and they could look at. I think we have opportunities regardless of which architecture they pick, but 1 architecture, obviously, pouring [ph] over the 787 components and the basic flight systems of 787 present a little bit higher opportunity for us. So yes, I would say, net, we have market share opportunity, hard at this point, until we get the architecture nailed down to, say, specifically what and how much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Nadol, JP Morgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on cash flow and what's changed. It was really nice to see the guidance go up, particularly in the operating cash flow side. Patrick, you mentioned the inventory's trend for the last couple of years had been going the other way. So it's definitely nice to see that go up. What's changed in the plan for the year? And as you look forward into next year, how -- any initial sense on how we can think about conversion trends from earnings and cash flow?","Patrick E. Allen","Joe, what I would say is that the 2 biggest changes from the plan -- the original plan, one is a lower deferred R&D spending. We talked about that probably for the last 2 quarters, and specifically related to that 737 Max spending and the ramp-up of that. The other area that we saw benefit on is in the R&D tax credit. We got the benefit of that, not only the P&L benefit, but the cash flow benefit from the lower R&D tax credit. Now with that said, I'd also say that we've pretty much hit our numbers with respect to working capital. So we've been able to flow all of that good news to cash flow for the year. Now as it relates to the trend for next year, I would say there's a -- I would put the cash flow conversion pretty much at a par with this year. And the big swinger is always pension contributions and deferred spending. And as we see deferred spending next year, it's going to be probably flat to slightly down. And I wouldn't anticipate pension contributions to be much different than they were this year. So I think our conversion for '14 will be about the same as this year and then improving thereafter as the deferred investment comes down.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on Commercial OE, 2 quick things. First, if you could talk about the flattish air transport growth there and how you expect that to trend as your new programs come online. Of course, there was a tough comp from last year. And then going back to the 777X that Rich asked about, I'm wondering if the 2 different architectures, it looks like in both cases you increased share. It seems like the difference would be a system that has your displays versus a system that has your displays and flight management, just based on what we think we learned in Paris. And so perhaps you could characterize what your content would look like under those scenarios versus your actual content on Max and 787.","Clayton M. Jones","Sure. Well, to your first question, Rob, that the -- I'll say the air transport OE was a little nonintuitive this year because there was very little growth there. But there are a couple of 3 things coming on, one, of which you cited and that is the comparables from third and fourth quarter of last year were very high to try to get across. But a couple of other things under the waterline. First, I would say, we got virtually no material help from 787. Remember, we've always said the ramp-up to synchronize our production, which was well ahead of Boeing's, wouldn't really start occurring to this fourth quarter that we're in now. And so we'll begin to see a little help in the fourth quarter and then more of it obviously as we get into next year, so next year is going to be a much bigger contributor than we've seen this year. So that's one thing. And then the other 2 things going on there is, that wouldn't be obvious, is that typically we book any non-recurring engineering that we get from the OEMs into this OE line. It's not a frequent occurrence, but every once in a while when there are changes, both Boeing and Airbus will give us non-recurring payment for making those changes that are out of scope. Plus on top of that, we had a lot of work that we were doing on the C919, specifically over in China. Both the Boeing component of that and the Chinese component of that are down for the quarter, and so that's having some impact of dampening the growth. The second one we had, which just gets into the real arcane, is that our heads-up display product that comes out of our air -- is managed out of our air transport area, is often sold on a product basis. One of the great strengths of our company is selling commercial products in the military. Well, last year, we had a number of HUD sales into 2Z, 3Z, 4Zs into military platforms that went away this year because of the funding. So if you look at those 2 things alone and were to take away the NRE and the HUD sales, our air transport OE would have been up 5%, which I think is least directionally correct. So that's what the dampening effect that we saw on that side. Relative to your second question on 777, I'm going to go back and give the same answer. It's premature to talk about any specific architectural decisions Boeing would make. I have found over my few years here at Collins it never pays to get out ahead of your customer, so we won't do that today. But when they make that decision, we have worked very closely with them. I think we have -- very specifically what opportunities that would flow from either of those 2 opportunity sets. And I'm not going to predispose what the answer might be here in public.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Patrick, incentive comp, maybe give us some color. You've had good numbers here. Where was incentive comp in the quarter and what should we be thinking about for the entire year?","Patrick E. Allen","What I'd say, Cai, is that our incentive comp plan remains on track. I think I've talked to you we're around 100% payout, actually, a little bit below that. And there were really no material adjustments to incentive comp this year. Now interestingly enough, year-over-year, it was a pretty big headwind because we had almost no incentive compensation in the third quarter of last year because we were adjusting guidance down. So there was about a $20 million headwind year-over-year on incentive compensation. Fortunately, we were able to offset that with a number of other, I'll say, employee-related costs that came down in the quarter, but no material change to incentive compensation. And I would expect the run rate to continue into the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to go back to the aftermarket, I appreciate your comments. What exactly is the aftermarket guidance now for the full year, because I know it's bounced around a bit. In my notes I still have mid- to high-single digits up, which looks tough given the comp in the fourth quarter. So maybe just talk about that. And then specifically breaking it down on mandates and spares and MRO, what you're seeing? And how far along are you on the mandate side and is that an upper as we head into '14?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. Well, we hadn't changed our guidance for aftermarket since the adjustment we made last quarter to MRO. And I would say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not counting on any recovering MRO as we did in the fourth quarter. So all the growth is going to be in that discretionary portion, which are mandates, retrofits and spares. The way I would look at it this way, I feel pretty good across the board on the mandates, on the spares that we've got loaded in there, and I'd say on most of the retrofits, especially as they involve the air transport side, things like the 767 display program at FedEx is locked and loaded, we're going to get that, I don't think there's any ambiguity to it. There's one area of risk that we're looking at very closely and that's the discretionary retrofits related to business aviation. Undeniably, because of the -- just the overtone of biz jets, especially at the light end, there should be, and historically has been, a circumstance that when people aren't buying new business jets, they upgrade their older business jets. And so they're typically very lucrative in terms of upgrading display programs or efficiency upgrades. And we saw that last year a lot, we saw at the beginning of this year. We are seeing some softening in that, a lot of quote activity. But the dealers that we deal with are struggling to close those quotes. And so I think the biggest risk item we've got going into the fourth quarter is that segment alone. And so we're working it really hard, we're watching it very carefully. We don't think it's severe enough that we're willing to come off our guidance right now. But if there's any risk, I think that's where it is. Otherwise, I feel pretty good about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Copeland, Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question on Government Systems and the resiliency in the margin there. I know you briefly commented on '14 and the natural uppers and downers. And I wondered if you might kind of put that in context with what you've seen this year in terms of maybe mixed benefits or cost benefits. Maybe just some color around how the margins have been so resilient in the face of the volume declines and what that means for what we should think about profitability levels next year?","Clayton M. Jones","I'll be glad to, Carter, as best I can. First, let me say, and I think it's undeniable, the folks at Government Systems and the shared services have been working their butt off. The good news is we saw this coming, we didn't walk past the graveyard where sequestration's concerned. We took the $60 million restructuring. We all remember in the fourth quarter of last year. And so the best thing we did is we were prepared for it and we acted early and often to try to get our costs down where we could and control what we could control. I think, far and away, I could talk about all of the sub elements, but far and away, that's what's helped us. We cut back on some R&D as we've said. But that should have been cut back because the opportunity set is not as great there and we are able to shift that over into our Commercial Systems. We're also looking at bringing more Commercial Systems product over, so we don't need that R&D. So that certainly helped out. And I guess the last thing I would say is we have been a little lucky. And the lucky part is that the cuts that we've been incurred have largely been through the development programs that come with naturally at lower margins. And so our stable product, the legacy products that we have, have been hanging in there pretty tight, and that's where most of our margin come because a lot of it is commercially-based. It's derived from what we have in the commercial, so it commands those margin. And then the final thing I'd say that we're beginning to get traction on, and I think it's going to be the bigger contributor as we go out the next few years is our international sales. FireStorm is a great example of that. Surface was the terrible portfolio over the last 2 years, now it's the jewel in the crown because it has been able to reset itself quickly and capitalize on this product that's very attractive in the international markets. As we begin to get more of that kind of opportunity set coming in, I think that will help us as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Godyn, Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","From your vantage point, are you seeing any changes in the marketplace on the back of the Cessna production cuts? And Clay, given your experience in the industry, just a best guess as to when we'll see a true inflection in demand for new jets?","Clayton M. Jones","No, I'm not seeing a lot of industry change at the low end as a result of that. I think environment in business aviation really hasn't changed over the years. I think the disappointment there for all of us is that we had expected some improvement and in fact, we haven't seen that, we've seen about steady-state to the high end and we've seen it worsen at the low end. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting to be about 2% down for business aviation because of the irrelatively higher quantities at the low end that's in deliveries. And we would have thought it to be maybe flat or up when we started the year. And I think -- but the conditions that brought that on, and I'm sure that Scott talked about it a lot yesterday, so I won't add much to that. But it's just the general economic conditions that are not favorable for people making this particular capital purchase at this particular time. And I think until we see that recovery, I have often said, things in the largest market in the United States, I think over 3% GDP growth. And I think we need some government regulation resolutions on taxes and health care that will restore general economic confidence. And when that happens, then I think businesses start to reinvest in everything, not just in business aviation, but certainly, that will come along as well. So it's hard to call, I think any of us would be unwise to do it. But I would say, we probably shouldn't expect any meaningful change over the next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gursky, Citi Investment Research.","And Jason has withdrawn his question. Your next question comes from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I thought I maybe ask a question on the buyback. Given your comments about debt repayments in the fourth quarter and the overall leverage of the company at this point, do you think it's fair to assume that the buy back going forward will be fairly more modest?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, we've been talking about that the entire year. We did have a fairly large slug of shares in the first half, particularly in the first quarter. And I said we continue to buy back shares but at a lower rate. So I think that trend will continue for the balance of the year. The other thing to point out is that fourth quarter, by far, is our largest cash flow quarter every year. And so we are going to be generating a lot of cash flow, we will use some of it for share repurchases and some of it to pay down that short-term debt.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you expect to take fourth quarter repayments to maybe be similar to what we saw in the third quarter, because it's pretty modest in the third quarter, right?","Patrick E. Allen","I don't want to speculate as to the exact amount. But on that order of magnitude, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yair Reiner, Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Patrick, just a follow-up question on that. You have $600 million of short-term debt, some of it is bond, some of it is bank debt. Kind of where would you like to be? How much of that do you want to term out? And if we kind of look ahead 12 months, what do you want the balance sheet to look like?","Patrick E. Allen","What I would say is that we'll be terming out a portion of that short-term debt. Exactly how much, I think depends on a couple of different things. First of all, we're still putting our plan together for next year and there is always variability around cash flow both for this year and next year. So I would say, we'll definitely refinance the $200 million of long-term debt that's coming due. And then another slug of that commercial paper will probably go long term as well. I just don't know how much at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about fiscal '14, I guess, from a total company perspective. If you knew nothing about the financial model, I think the reference to '13 as a transition year would sort of imply '14 looks much better. And so I know you don't want to get too far ahead of September, but how are you thinking about that? Does revenue grow much more than flat on a total company basis? Is there anything much different next year in the segment incremental margins than you normally see and anything below the line worth noting? It seems to me that the answer to all of that is really no and that everything looks fairly similar to '13? And so given the reference to '13 as a transition year, just want to make sure there isn't something much different than what I'm expecting.","Clayton M. Jones","Well, no, the last thing I want to do as I leave is to steal Kelly Ortberg's thunder. So as we typically do in September, we'll come out with all the answers to every question that you just ask to try to provide the color that ultimately you're going to want to know on what '14 looks like. The only thing I would do is reiterate what I've already said. I do believe this quarter will be sort of -- we'll look back historically and say, this is sort of a low watermark. I think it might be lumpy as it goes. Nothing in this life is a straight line, as we all learn, especially given the market conditions. But I just have a feeling right now, and having done it for a while, I guess that I'm entitled to a feeling. I have a feeling right now that it isn't all peaches and cream in the future, but it's going to get better than it has been. Because the last 2 or 3 years have been pretty darn hard. And I just think we're getting to that point of stabilization. If you heard my presentations over the last year, that's what we're looking for. We're looking for that stabilization where we become more predictable. I absolutely believe, as bad as it still is, that Government Systems is approaching that stability. And I've said, by this time next year, that market will be as stable as it ever has. I mean, there'll be uncertainties, but we'll be back to a point where sequestration will be baked in, we'll have a strategy out of the Pentagon, we'll have a '15 budget and a sense of what the priorities are. And we'll be much easier able to call it. And as I said before, I don't think it's going to be as far down as it was this year. In Commercial Systems, it completely relies on things outside of my control. What's the economy going to be to help start facilitating a business jet upper on the light end, I think the long range will hang in there. The air transport production rates are locked and loaded. And then as we lace in these market share improvements, we rely totally on our OEMs to get that total development job done. And hopefully, again, we'll do our portion of it. But when they get that job done, there's an annuity there that is undeniable. We're going to see 787, A350, CSeries, MRJ, a whole host of new business jets coming in over the next 3 to 4 years. And what quarter that happens? Yes, I guess, we'd like to call it, but it won't matter. That's going to happen. And that's the undeniable part of this transition I talk about. So that's why I feel good about where this company is. And if you're not in it, you better get in it.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Patrick, I wanted to pursue a little bit a question you answered to Cai. You said employee costs were down, offsetting some of the roughly $20 million headwind for comp. Can you quantify how much it was down? And whether it was allocated the normal way across the different sectors because the incremental margin in Commercial was very high and obviously, were even higher whatever the negatives were here.","Patrick E. Allen","I would say this, George, it did distribute kind of as you would expect based on the employee base, it's across the board. It offset most of that headwind that I talked about from an incentive compensation perspective. And the thing that's going to be hard to predict a little bit is, next quarter we've got -- we'll definitely have more headwind on incentive compensation. The question is, are some of these employee costs, particularly we saw some very favorable medical spending, the question is whether that favorable trend will continue. That tends to be pretty lumpy and harder to predict.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gursky, Citi Investment Research.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I did want to ask a question on the rarely asked topic, which is in-flight entertainment. Not just the wide-body stuff, of course, I'd like to get a little bit of color on your expectations on that wind down and whether these higher rates of retirement of aircraft you're going to have an accelerating impact on wide-body IFE. But I'd be curious to know how the product development cycle is going on with IFE and whether there are some opportunities for you in other areas, narrow-bodies in particular, and how that is going to impact the outlook for your transport OE and biz jet OE over the next 12 to 18 months?","Clayton M. Jones","Right. Well, first, relative to wide-body IFE, I think the trends are very clearly -- there is a wind down business. We're really producing no hardware for that, it's basically a service and support type business as long as they stay on wing. But what I would say, even though it's a declining sales revenue, it's very profitable now, which that business hasn't been over the majority of its life. So we're not in a good place relative to growth nor do we expect to, but it is a good profit and cash generator as it winds down. And I don't think -- I think we properly sized the relative rate of decline. I mean, it's been going down about $0.20 or $0.25 a year, as I recall. I don't think it's going to continue to kind of atrophy at about those levels until it goes away. The good news, over time, it will just become a footnote in a more declining sense of a drag on Commercial Systems as the size decreases. Relative to everything else, well, which is what we call cabin management, we're actually very bullish on that. We're introducing a whole new product line of what we call a client-centric product that significantly reduces the costs and improves the reliability of the narrow-body product and provides in-seat capability at a much lower cost, which we think is going to be an extremely attractive product for the narrow-body world as we go. We should get that product certified, I want to say, by early next year. And so as we go into '14, that's one of the opportunity sets for growth that we see in Commercial Systems, probably more to the back half of the year. But going forward, beyond that, if you go past the like 12-month period, I think, yes, that would be a very good contributor. And then our biz jet cabin work continues to be good. Our Venue product is selling extremely well, really for the same reason, highly reliable, lower-cost system, flexible as it go into all cabin sizes. So that is a good business for us now. We think that there are some product introductions coming out that will provide us even more growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on one of the R&D things that you talked about. You had some programs that ended and could you elaborate on them? And also talk about the KC-46 and your integral to that, and it sounds like it's making real progress?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. The -- I'd say the biggest effort there that we had that's winding down is the Pro Line Fusion basic product development. As you know, it is sort of 2 different kind of element, the basic product line and then we have application costs, which is certification and tailoring it to the specific OEM. And it's the application costs that will be going on as a steady-state, and in some cases ramping up, but the product line cost is the big kahuna. And that's begun to wind down, Howard. So that's probably the biggest tailwind that we're getting out of R&D. And then the rest of them are just small, I would say, a lot of BFE product upgrades that are finishing. I've mentioned some of the cabin management stuff. We're in the certification work now and not basic product development. So that's what's bringing that down. In terms of KC-46, the program is going very well from our perspective. Obviously, the application of a lot of the commercial products is something we know how to do and that's proceeding apace. And so everything I see or know of in the KC-46 is favorable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It's actually Michael Ciarmoli. One area of focus, just on the margins for Commercial, obviously, very good in the quarter. How do we think about the sustainability there, maybe over the next 6 to 9 months as you rethink with the 787, I mean, is that going to be sort of a dilutive event to both the corporate margin or the commercial margins and the incremental margins?","Patrick E. Allen","Michael, it's Patrick. What I'd say is, if you look at the margin performance for the quarter, there are 2 -- kind of 2 key things. One is, there was about a 46% incremental flow before research and development. That is probably a little richer than it's been over the past few quarters because we had such a good performance in our aftermarket. And as you know, aftermarket tends to be a little bit higher profitability than the OEM. The second thing is lower R&D. I think, year-over-year, we're down about $10 million in research and development. What I'd say about both of those things is the product mix is going to vary quarter-by-quarter but obviously, as 787 starts to ramp-up, it will come in at a lower margin, so discreetly that 787 is going to be dilutive to the incremental margin. The other thing is regarding R&D, as I indicated earlier, we're expecting R&D to go up a little bit from third quarter to fourth quarter. So I don't think it will be as much of a tailwind over the course of the next few quarters as it was this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Derchin, CRT Capital Group.","Michael W. Derchin - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Clay, you mentioned something that's relatively new phenomena, which is the parting out of relatively new aircraft by the airlines. I'm wondering if you could expand upon that. And also you mentioned a business that you're in, I wasn't familiar with that Intertrade, can you expand on that also?","Clayton M. Jones","Sure. Well, I think it's a phenomena that's being talked about a lot more lately because there are a lot more participants in it. In essence, as I said in my opening statements, what you're seeing is some of these retirements, which are accelerating, are relatively new, and especially if they're in the 737 next generation and A320 families, where there's a lot of proliferation of those aircraft, but also where the parts have some utility. And what we're seeing there is a lot of the used parts are particularly attractive to airlines who have aircraft who's maybe service life is somewhat finite, 5 to 6 years, when they know that a refurbished used part will serve them very well and reliably and don't need to go buy a brand new part. And that, I think, is the phenomena that we're seeing. It's always existed, but not in the scale that we're seeing now. So it's a combination of the more availability of these aircraft being retired and the airlines trying to run their operation very efficiently. I want to reiterate, these are very safe parts, they're certified, they're backed by certification just like anything else is. But we're just seeing a higher quantity of them. Interesting enough, we bought this Intertrade business over 10 years ago, essentially to help us broker avionics equipment that we would take as trade in, as used. It's grown far beyond that. And now we're even in some of the engine business brokering now. So we provide an airline just about any part they'd want, whether it's an Avionics or Rockwell Collins part or anyone else. And as I said, it's been very lucrative for us over the last year as we participated in this phenomena.","Operator","Your final question comes from Joe Nadol, JP Morgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a follow-up on cash deployment. Clay, you did mention during your opening comments, just on the opportunities here for Rockwell Collins to deploy the balance sheet in very value accretive ways. You guys obviously have been really focused on the buyback, even adding a little bit of debt the last couple of years to buy back all that stock. Today, we're at $0.70 so it's the highest it's been since precrisis. And I'm just wondering, when you look at your stock, when you look at the M&A opportunities out there, both Commercial and Defense, if changing valuations of all types have had any impact on the way you're thinking about deploying capital?","Clayton M. Jones","What I would say about that, Joe, is that our basic look at capital deployment has not changed in the period that I've been the CEO. We don't keep a lot of cash laying around because we're a good cash machine, we can get it when we need it. We've got a lot of good backstops, so we dominated the risk there. And will you see what the opportunity set is out there, value creative, strategic acquisitions is always our first priority if we can help grow the business. The environment for that hasn't been all that good in the last 2 or 3 years because of the inability to value some of these properties in a way that's reasonable. As those opportunities come up, then we'll continue to take a hard look at that. If they make sense and they pass all of our financial gates, then we'll do one. If not, then we'll return that cash to the shareowners as we have. As Patrick mentioned, we've returned over $4 billion and significantly reduced our share count over this period, when we haven't been doing acquisitions. But both apply and we've been very clear about that in our capital deployment discussions we've had with all investors. I would expect you would see that same strategy laid out under Kelly's leadership here. Patrick, obviously, will still be here helping him do that. And so I would say no big changes where that's concerned. But we're ever mindful of the conditions out there to ensure that what we do is creating value.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Beusing for any closing remarks.","Steve Buesing","Thank you.

Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Rockwell Collins Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Adam Palmer. Please go ahead, sir.","Adam Palmer - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you, Julie, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note, today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide 2 of this webcast presentation, and from time-to-time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. Well its certainly been an exciting few months following the close of our acquisition of B\/E Aerospace in April and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making both from a synergy and an integration perspective.","As you saw in our earnings release this morning clearly the acquisition has not distracted us from delivering strong financial performance in the third quarter. We grew our top line 5% organically highlighted by 8% growth in commercial systems. We also had strong operating margins across the entire business. And our continued efforts to improve cash conversion re paying off, as we increased our cash flow from operating activities by 87% for the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year.","Now turning back to our new Interior Systems segment, we came right out of the chute with 9% pro forma sales growth. Organizationally, we've also formed two portfolios within Interior Systems, one is aircraft seating and then the other is interior products and service. Aircraft seating includes forward fit and retrofit seating revenues, while the interior products and services includes non-seating products, such as galleys, lavs, oxygen and lighting systems as well as aftermarket services.","The interior products and services was the primary source of growth for the business this quarter driven by growth and some accelerated deliveries for the A350 galleys as well as higher 737 advanced lav sales. Let me take just a moment to give you some context about the different components of the Interior Systems business. Currently two-thirds of the business in total is forward fit and about one-time is aftermarket.","Half of the forward fit sales are interior products which will tend to grow more consistently with aircraft production rates. Seating is the other half and it will have the more dynamic growth profile based on the mix of customers, the aircraft type and the seating offering for which they're making or taking deliveries. In the aftermarket, about half of sales are spares and repair, which will grow along with traffic and the installed base, while the other half represent retrofits, which will tend to have a more lumpy profile depending on the timing of specific retrofit programs. So hopefully this gives you some insight as to how to think about this new segment going forward.","Turning now to the integration. Our teams continue to make good progress, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to exceed our initial $160 million in run rate cost synergies. In fact, our integration teams are now working towards an internal target of $200 million. So, clearly, things are going well there.","I'm also pleased with the work our teams have done in identifying potential revenue synergies, and if you recall, our business case for the acquisition did not include revenue synergies. So, any opportunities represent upside to the deal for us.","We believe there are opportunities for meaningful revenue synergies across all of our markets, and we recently announced our first one with the agreement with Comlux to provide a comprehensive VIP cabin aftermarket solution, including seating, lighting, connectivity from our IMS business, as well as a cabin management system from commercial systems. This is exactly the type of opportunity we expected.","In addition, I'm encouraged by the cultural fit with the former B\/E Aerospace employees and legacy Rockwell Collins and the level of enthusiasm from our team about the combined future. So, we're off to a great start, executing our integration plan to deliver the value of the combined business.","Turning now to Commercial Systems. We had a very strong quarter with 8% growth, which was bolstered by a high level of used equipment sales from our Intertrade business. For the year, sales are playing out about as expected with bizjet OEM sales headwinds subsiding and the Commercial Systems aftermarket strengthening, due largely to the ADS-B mandate activity and increased bizjet cockpit retrofits.","We also made an exciting announcement at the Paris Air Show earlier this quarter, with our flight operations and maintenance exchanger solution called FOMAX, which has been selected by Airbus for standard on their A320 family. Under this agreement we'll supply each A320 aircraft with a secured router to wirelessly send aircraft performance and maintenance data to ground-based operations. There will also be a retrofit option for the installed base of A320s. So, in addition to the hardware revenue for this program, we'll sell additional software features and hosted services to the airlines for the data that comes off the aircraft. So this is really an exciting new growth area for us and is another synergy capture in the information management space.","Moving now to Government Systems. I'm sure you noticed our growth rate this quarter was less than what we've been delivering over the past few quarters. This was driven primarily by some production issues in our avionics portfolio. These are in the process of being resolved, they're not a big deal, we'd expect to catch-up these deliveries over the next couple of quarters. We did have a very strong quarter in the rest of the business including higher sales in COM\/NAV products as well as increased operating margins.","Now, looking ahead in Government Systems, similar to last year, we have a big fourth quarter yet to reach our sales guidance for the year. But as of the end of this third quarter, we have a higher percentage of our Government Systems fourth quarter sales, in backlog than we did last year. So I'm confident that we'll achieve our forecasted sales growth and finish the year strong in Government Systems.","Moving now to Information Management Services, this is another really strong quarter with sales growth of 10% and operating margins over 21%. This performance was the result of revenue increases in both non-aviation and the aviation part of the business as we continue to see demand for our aviation connectivity services increasing across the board. As an example, we just signed an agreement with a major Asian carrier to be their exclusive line-fit provider for nose-to-tail communications for a firm order of greater than 125 aircraft.","This is another airline that will utilize Rockwell Collins' cabin connect wireless in-flight connectivity solution, underpinned by Inmarsat's Global Xpress satellite network allowing passengers a range of connectivity options including e-mail, Internet access, as well as video streaming and electronic-commerce options.","First aircraft will deliver in 2018, and this represents another significant air transport cabin connectivity selection on the heels of the Norwegian Air Shuttle selection that I mentioned in the last call. Additionally, the airline selected our ACARS global link flight deck connectivity solution, our flight tracking services over VHF, HF and SwiftBroadband safety services. So we are doing a good job of penetrating this airborne connectivity market.","So in summary, we saw a strong execution of the business this quarter. I'm pleased with the start of our Interior Systems business.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Pat to walk us through the details for the quarter.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter fiscal year 2017. I'll begin on slide 3 where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, adjusted income, adjusted earnings per share and diluted average shares outstanding.","Total company sales for the quarter increased $760 million or 57% compared to the third quarter last year. Now the third quarter sales include $695 million from our newly formed Interior Systems business. Organically, sales increased $65 million or 5% while sales increased across all of our segments. Adjusted net income was $263 million and adjusted earnings per share was $1.64 in the third quarter of the current year, compared to adjusted net income of $220 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 in the same period last year.","The effective tax rate for adjusted income in the prior year was 14.4% compared to 27.1% in the current year, as prior year results include a $0.31 income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry forward. Excluding this item, adjusted earnings per share would have increased 21%.","As we turn to slide 4, you see the results of our new Interior Systems segment. On a pro forma basis, Interior Systems sales increased 9%, driven primarily by higher deliveries of Airbus A350 galleys and Boeing 737 advanced lavs. Operating earnings for the quarter were $80 million and operating margin was 11.5%. However, if you exclude the impact of purchase accounting, operating margin was 18.4%.","Turning to slide 5, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $658 million in the third quarter, up 8% compared to the same period last year. Aftermarket sales increased $43 million or 18% to $279 million due to higher used aircraft equipment sales, higher regulatory mandate sales and higher spares provisioning. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $7 million or 2% to $374 million, primarily due to the higher product deliveries in support of Airbus A350, Boeing 737 and Bombardier CSeries rate increases, partially offset by lower legacy wide-body and business aircraft OEM production rates. Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $3 million to $144 million while operating margin declined 110 basis points to 21.9%. Operating margin declined due to the growth in low margin used equipment sales and higher amortization of pre-production engineering costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, operating margins are expected to be impacted by increased company-funded R&D expenditures, due to higher spend on the Boeing 777X program and the newly announced Airbus FOMAX program.","Moving now to slide 6, Government Systems overall revenue increased 1% to $558 million. Third quarter Communication and Navigation sales increased 21% over the prior year, due to higher legacy communication product deliveries, higher deliveries of GPS-related products and higher test and training range sales. Avionics sales decreased 9% over the prior year, driven by lower deliveries for various fighter platforms as a result of production issues, the wind-down of legacy tanker hardware deliveries, and lower rotary wing sales, partially offset by higher development program sales.","Government Systems third quarter operating earnings increased $8 million to $123 million, resulting in an operating margin of 22%, a 130 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings and operating margin were due to higher sales volume and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs.","Turning to slide 7, Information Management Services sales increased 10% over the prior year. IMS sales increased due to 9% sales growth in aviation-related revenues, driven by increased usage of connectivity services. In addition, non-aviation revenues increased 10%, due primarily to higher nuclear security mandate revenue.","Information Management Services third quarter operating earnings increased $13 million to $39 million, resulting in an operating margin of 21.3% compared to 15.6% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due primarily to higher sales volume and the favorable resolution of certain prior year claims associated with international business jet support services.","Looking next to slide 8, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $251 million of free cash flow compared to $90 million last year. The increase in cash generation was due primarily to higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher production inventory, higher income tax payments and acquisition-related expenses.","Slide 9 shows our capital structure subsequent to our debt issuance during the quarter pursuant to the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is just over 5. However, we're planning to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage in the near term, and expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within a couple of years. We still remain focused on shareholder return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes in the range of 2 to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program.","Now on to slide 10, where we provide a summary of our updated fiscal year 2017 financial guidance. Total sales are projected to be about $6.8 billion and total segment operating margins are projected to be in the range of 19% to 20%. Previously our GAAP earnings per share guidance was $4.50 to $4.70 per share. We have raised the range of the GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to $4.85 to $5.05 per share to reflect a couple of changes related to purchase accounting.","First we have refined our assumptions regarding the tax jurisdictions of certain purchase accounting adjustments. We now expect our GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25% as a result of these changes, as compared to our previously guided range of 27% to 28%. This change is expected to favorably impact our GAAP earnings per share by about $0.15 in fiscal year 2017.","Second, we've recorded purchase accounting entries to adjust inventory and certain contracts to fair market value. Because the adjustments are material non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, we're excluding these items from our adjusted earnings per share metric. The amortization of these fair value adjustments in aggregate is expected to favorably impact GAAP EPS by about $0.20 this year. Since our adjusted earnings per share metric excludes these purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for adjusted earnings per share and effective tax rate on adjusted earnings remain unchanged from our prior guidance.","We've provided an updated reconciliation between our estimated GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share guidance on slide 13 in this presentation, as well as in the non-GAAP table in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","Before I hand the call back over, I wanted to give you a brief update on the new revenue recognition standard. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect some significant changes to our financial statements upon adoption of the new standard, specifically related to accounting for pre-production engineering costs and customer funding for commercial contracts. This quarter we made the decision to adopt the new standard on time in fiscal year 2019, and we'll be quantifying the effect of adoption as the date approaches.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. Adam, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Adam Palmer - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those additional questions as time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Adam Palmer - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping you could clarify two things. One is, it looks like cash performance year-to-date is pretty strong. Last year's fourth quarter would probably put you through the midpoint of your cash guidance for the year and you didn't even own these back then. And then Kelly, could you just clarify the comments on avionics that were affecting the quarter specifically and where you are in terms of seeing those resolve into the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. Let me hit your last question first, and then I'll ask Pat to address your first question. So we had some product conformity issues in our Portland facility that caused us to shut down deliveries for head-up displays to our customers in the quarter. We've identified the issues. They're not high technology issues. We've got some tolerance conformity issues. We're having to rework some components. We have started shipping the products here this quarter and the majority of what didn't get shipped per plan will get shipped in the fourth quarter, with a little bit leaking into the first quarter of fiscal 2018. So it's unfortunate. It's probably the only blemish in our what was a really good operating quarter for us, but we've got it at hand, and we'll get it corrected here shortly. It hasn't caused any end-customer delivery delays. So it's something that we've managed through.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","And as it relates to the cash flow, Myles, you're right, I'm very pleased with our cash flow performance third quarter year-to-date. Now fourth quarter is always our highest quarter, and fortunately it seems a lot more achievable this year than it has in prior years. So, I'm optimistic that we'll be able to achieve or exceed our guidance for cash flow.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more the color on the pieces of the Interiors business at the beginning of the call was helpful. It looks like maybe on a pro forma basis, we'll be looking at about $3.1 billion of sales for interiors in your fiscal 2017, and when you think about those pieces that you outlined, first-of-all, is that a fair assessment of the pro forma sales and second of all when you think about those pieces that you've outlined what gives you confidence that you can grow that in fiscal 2018?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, so one thing that, that we're seeing in fiscal 2017 is very strong upward lift driven by the ramp up of the 737 MAX lavs and A350 galleys. That growth rate, while we still see additional growth next year, will abate a little bit, because of \u2013 we've ramped up this year. This year in fiscal 2017 is a fairly low year in the aftermarket retrofit opportunities that tends to be large program retrofits primarily seating. The backlog looks very good for that retrofit seating business to actually increase here in our fiscal 2018. So, we've got good line of sight to the programs and the products associated with that. So, as I look at our FY 2018, the focus for us in our interior businesses close the remaining pursuits that we have for aftermarket, so stuff that's tied to form fit production rates, I think we've got pretty well in hand.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","And Seth, as said, on a pro-forma pro forma basis, I think we're looking at Interior Systems probably closer to $3 billion.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then Pat, as a follow-up the contract liabilities that you mentioned. Can you tell us about what constitutes most of that. And if anything changed with regard to your perception of the profitability of some of those programs?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Actually it didn't really come as a surprise to us at all. Anytime you acquire a business the size of Interior Systems, you're going to have contracts that are below market. And these are a couple of, several contracts that are below market that we just marked-to-market. So not a surprise at all, and pretty much in line with what we had expected.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the time.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Kelly on the interior side how are the market share gains looking and is there any incremental opportunity for you on platforms that you're not currently on?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well there certainly is both in terms of buyer-furnished equipment share selection. So, I wouldn't say platforms we aren't currently on, but more in terms of new opportunities as airlines are selecting their interior equipment for their future aircraft buys and there is always opportunities for us to improve our share there. I think in terms of new positions on the aircraft that we currently standard positions, those are something we're looking at, but those opportunities come at fewer time increments than capturing more share in the BFE marketplace. So, we're focused on a couple of those, but they'll take a little more time for us.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And a quick clarification, I think you just said in your response to Seth's question about aftermarket retrofit being a little light this year and picking up next year. Can you just provide a little more color onto why it's light this year and then the inflection going forward?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","It's really not market-driven, it's just program timing-driven. For an example, we had a really large retrofit program with Southwest that we completed last year. We've got a retrofit program with American that's picking up. It's just the timing of those programs. But again as I look at the backlog and the orders that we've booked, we're confident that we'll see \u2013 next year, we'll actually return to a more normal level of retrofit business where this year we're actually a little light. Now we're growing in the standard side of the business, the forward fit side of the business this year. So it'll be a nice balance, because that growth rate will slow down a little bit and the aftermarket will pick up.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Probably a question for Pat. Pat, can you help us reconcile the B\/E bid and margins, when obviously stripping out the intangible amortization. But, when you consider synergies and then accounting conformity, I would've thought the margins actually would've been a little bit higher in the quarter. It looks like you're assuming margins are going to pickup in the fourth quarter, but just some help reconciling all the moving pieces that are within that number?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. Let me give you a little bit of color, because, I think probably for the quarter, the synergies that we've achieved and the cost to achieve the synergies pretty much offset each other. So, there's not a lot of benefit there. And then the conformity adjustments, actually for the entire year of fiscal 2017, and this maybe where I'm disconnected. But, the conformity adjustment for the fiscal year 2017 is actually a headwind, because, right, in this year, the spend is higher than the amortization would have been. So, when we change the accounting, it actually created a little bit of a headwind probably about $15 million to $20 million for the full year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And how should we think about that moving forward. In the next year, you're going to actually see a net benefit from that or is it going to be...?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","It will flip to a benefit next year. We're still in the process of quantifying that, but it'll be a benefit next year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, you had previously talked about free cash flow conversion on adjusted EPS moving close to 100% into fiscal 2018. Can you just update us there? Thanks.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","I think, we're still on track. Again, we haven't released any 2018 guidance, and we're still working through the numbers. But, I think, we're still on track to achieve that.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to start off Kelly on the commercial transport and business jet. But commercial transport in particular the aftermarket. You obviously called out Intertrade as putting up some very good or driving that, as well as provisioning. Can you parse that out a little bit and just talk about maybe the impact of Intertrade in the quarter or some of the trends you're seeing around that side of the business?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. Roughly half of the air transport aftermarket growth was the big Intertrade. We actually moved an aircraft with two engines, which is atypical for us. By the way, we won't move that much used business here in the fourth quarter, but a big quarter for us. But the rest of it is what we expected. The ADS-B mandates are picking up. We did see a recovery in the heads-up display updates, retrofits, as well and then we're seeing some provisioning for MAX and A350 playing through, as we would've expected. So, the air transport aftermarket is good.","Now in terms of what I'll say the core MRO component of air transport, we didn't see any growth there at all and in fact I think it was down a little bit and that's that part recycling. We're not expecting that to recover in the near future, because of our heavy installed base of 75, 76 and 747 aircraft that are going through the end-of-life recycling phenomenon. So, it's just impacting our ability to grow offsetting growth that we're seeing in the more recent model equipment.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Just as a quick follow-up on ADS-B. Can you just remind us where we are, is this a tailwind again into fiscal year 2018 or what percentage of the opportunity do you think has been captured there regarding the mandate?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. The mandate's really picking up this year. I think it will be a tailwind into 2018. 2019 will probably start coming down the curve. So, 2019 will be more like 2017.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Quick, maybe just a couple of quick details for you. When we think about the normalized R&D \u2013 company-funded R&D spend going forward including the impact of Interior Systems, I guess, this is for Pat. How should we think about that? What is the normalized run rate for R&D at Interior Systems?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","What we're seeing for Interior Systems is about \u2013 roughly about 10% of sales, Ron. And it breaks out about 8% is company-funded, about 2% is customer-funded, so that's the \u2013 I'd say that's probably a pretty good gauge as to the normalized run rate for Interior Systems.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, the overall normalized run rate for the company will be somewhere between 6% and 8%?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. That I think that works out to that to right about 6% to 7%, yeah.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe one last quick little detail, how should we think about the free cash flow conversion outlook as we go through the rest of the year?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Free cash flow conversion outlook for the rest of the year?","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Free cash flow...","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","We forecasted free cash flow of $650 million roughly for the year and I think we're on track to deliver that.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Cool. Thanks so much.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","$650 million to $750 million, so, I think, we'll hit, certainly hit the midpoint of that range, so $700 million.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, I guess your guide shows amortization of contract liability of $80 million for the year, inventory fair value $55 million. Could you tell us where were those numbers in the third quarter and what kind of impact will that have on the fourth? And also I think at one point, you talked of higher spend on the A350 galleys. How does that figure into the outlook for BEAV? Thanks so much.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","The numbers for the inventory and the contract reserves were about the same. I think on a PBT basis, I want to say it was about roughly about $40 million for each of them. Now the impact from the contract adjustment was a little bit higher from an earnings per share or net income basis, because the tax rate on the contract adjustment was quite a bit lower. So it was on an EPS basis, or on a net income basis, it was roughly about $10 million higher for the amortization of the contract liability.","And Cai, I'm sorry the second question was?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","A350 spend, we'll continue to be spending on A350 through the balance of fiscal 2017, and then that will ramp down in A350 area in fiscal 2018.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Does it go up in the fourth quarter?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","No.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning. Kelly, I think you talked a little bit earlier about retrofit demand and so on. But if we could go into a little bit more detail on the wide-body demand, maybe on the OE side, with some production rates coming down, some cancellations. A380 for example is coming down. I think a few A350s were cancelled on the OE side. And then, Crane made a comment earlier this week that they were seeing some softness in the interior \u2013 in their interior systems business. I don't know if that was retrofit or OE. But could you just speak to that a bit? Are you seeing anything different than what you had expected maybe a quarter or two ago?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","No, not different than a quarter or two ago, the rate reduction that was announced by Airbus on A380 doesn't surprise us. The A350 was something we anticipated. So I think the current market situation really hasn't changed much. I will say that, what I said in the last call, we got to continue to watch the Middle East situation, because we do have a lot of business with all the carriers in the Middle East. But I think we've got that pretty well captured in our outlook, at least the outlook that they're currently forecasting. Boeing was in their call yesterday, I thought more encouraged about the 777 base rates for managing their bridge. So we're hopeful that we don't see any further rate reductions there.","And then we've got the good content on the 787 and the A350, so that will help. One thing that's clear is there's significant in our portfolio, a pretty significant decline in super first class. That goes along with the very large aircraft softness in the market. And so super first class is down pretty significantly this year. We'll expect super first class to be down again next year. But that will be offset by seating in other class of seating going forward.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","As you've gone through the acquisition process, have you studied or do you have a group that has studied the effect of lower oil prices on retention of aircraft that might have been retired and then the proclivity of these aircraft to then be retrofitted? So in other words, do you have some sense of the exchange between new and old aircraft? If you do have an adjustment in deliveries and so forth, is it a push or do you prefer one over the other?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, yes, we do have a group that looks at that and analyzes that and kind of works with the industry to try to understand what those dynamics are. I would say, if someone just makes a decision to keep an aircraft for another couple of years, it's not going to drive a major retrofit opportunity. They're likely not going to put significant money into that. I think where we see more opportunities is in the airlines where they're taking a new configuration or a new aircraft of type into the market and they're introducing a new cabin interior with that, then they'll want to go retrofit their fleet around that. And that's the lumpiness of it. It just depends on the timing of the new aircraft, probably more so then the timing of retirements of legacy aircraft.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just to close the loop on that, what's the latest with regard to that specifically in terms of the behavior you're seeing from airlines who are making these decisions today. In other words, are we moving in one direction or the other? Are you seeing airlines say you know what, I'm going to start retrofitting more and retiring less or I want to take my new aircraft and go that way?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, we're seeing continued, for the A350 787 type aircraft continuing to take the new aircraft. As I mentioned, we are seeing higher volumes of retrofit programs now here, for example for next year in backlog. So, I think we'll see more retrofits of the existing fleet to conform to the new aircraft interiors that they're taking with the new aircraft going forward.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Hi good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Kelly, the first one, I wanted to ask is, we saw pretty decent growth in business in regional sequential in OE. Certainly, aftermarket was a lot better. Are you slightly more constructive maybe on where we are in the business jet market?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, as you know, I'm glad you asked that question, George, because as we came into the year, we had headwinds in our bizjet OEM really driven by production rates, but also by the inventory rationalization that was going on they had too much of our inventory. So we're down pretty significantly. But as you saw in our BRS segment, we reported this quarter we were down only 3%. Now we're up a little bit in regionals, we're probably down about 7% in core bizjet. Having said that, we're down to low single-digit declines in bizjet OEM.","And I would say this is the time of the year that we normally get rate adjustments or new news and it's been very quiet, which is good news, meaning we're not going to see further reductions. So I'm very hopeful that, that we're through the inventory rationalization and with no unforeseen rate reductions across the board, we're actually going to, don't fall off your chair when I say this, we're actually going to see growth in our bizjet OEM and that's coming pretty soon.","I'm hopeful that we'll see growth through 2018, at least because we don't have the headwinds of the inventory rationalization, and then hopefully we see some overall market recovery by 2019, so we can get this bizjet OEM business back to sustained growth.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And one for you, Patrick, can you just quantify the benefit in ARINC?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Of the claims?","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. That was about $2 million to $3 million.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","George, it's IMF. I'm sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I have two questions, one for Kelly. Trading has all of a sudden taken on a larger share of your aftermarket business. Is that something that you want to continue to grow and to take advantage of market changes?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, we're going to take advantage of market changes, as I've said before, I think we're going to continue to be pretty disciplined here because it's not a high margin business, and we're basically brokering these sales. So we really need to ensure that we don't get stuck with inventory.","So I've focused our team on making sure they have a sale concurrent with our acquisition of an asset so that we can move these assets very fast. In this quarter, we did that. We had both engines and the fuselage actually sold before we concurrent with \u2013 making the actual buyer of the equipment. So we'll continue to do that. What that will mean is, is that we'll tend to be a little bit lumpy in terms of the opportunities. I came into the year thinking we weren't going to see as many opportunities, but with traffic and the like, it's much better than I expected. So we'll take advantage of that going forward. It also gives us really good visibility as to what the airlines are doing relative to used parts. So we're going to continue to exercise the Intertrade business. The team did a great job this quarter, and there's more opportunities out there that they're working.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","No, I see that and the numbers show that.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Second is. Thank you. And second is Patrick, you know the problem with history is that you didn't get to compare with the new numbers. And so as we look at the old reconciliation tables with the new reconciliation tables, where you get to the same bottom line, there's some new categories and some new items and while I've \u2013 you've kind of gone through parts of this during the call. Maybe you could summarize it. I mean, it looks to me like the one item that sort of stands out is the contract liability adjustment, which would tend to \u2013 I'll use the word inflate the B\/E profitability as reported relative to what the underlying business is. So can you reconcile the tables and then help me with that last observation?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, Howard. You're right generally and that's why the GAAP earnings per share number went up. It was really the net effect of a couple of different things, but that contract adjustment was a big piece of it, which is what I spoke to in my prepared remarks. But as we reconcile to adjusted earnings per share, the reason why the adjusted earnings per share hasn't changed is, we've excluded that contract adjustment. So if you think about the main components, we still have the amortization of the intangible assets. We still have the deal costs, which we've excluded from adjusted earnings per share.","We've introduced this contract liability, which is going to provide about $0.55 of benefit to GAAP earnings per share, that is out of our adjusted earnings per share. And then we've got about a $0.35 detriment to GAAP earnings per share from an inventory fair value adjustment, which again we back out to get to adjusted earnings per share. So, I think the good news is the adjusted earnings per share really hasn't changed much at all, it's just these purchase accounting adjustments that go into the GAAP earnings.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I hear you. And I guess maybe the point also is core Collins was a little bit better.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, I think core Collins was quite a bit better.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","We were very pleased with the margin performance.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.

Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Kelly. Could you give us, I was kind of circling back to Ron's question and Patrick thanks for that information on the R&D for the Interiors business. But how do we think about the R&D cycle for the kind of the Interiors business over the next say 12 month to 24 months however you want to frame it. Just whether our percentage of sales are just in general, what you're seeing in terms of the overall spend rate?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think you're going to see that cycle as much, because recognize that when we do these retrofit programs, there is non-recurring engineering that's required for the qualification of the new seat configuration to the different fleet that they have. So I think you'll see pretty consistent R&D spend out of our Interior Systems business. I don't think it will cycle as much associated with a new airplane.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, could you just provide, just as a follow up, Kelly back to the mandate. So did you say peak in 2018 and then you come off in 2019?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Right. We'll start to come down at the back half of 2019. So what happened this year, is we kind of ramped up. I think we'll stay pretty hot through 2018, and then we'll start to ramp down in 2019.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W.

Your line is open.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I think at the $6.8 billion guidance it's implying something like flat pro forma growth in the fourth quarter. I don't know if that, if you would correct that assessment or not. But if that's in the right ball park, could you give a sense of whether you're just giving yourselves a little buffer there in fourth quarter, or whether there's something else you're seeing that makes you just a little conservative on that outlook?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, I think we have opportunity in the fourth quarter to, on the top-line number.","Patrick E.

Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to go back to the synergies you talked about at the beginning. And you said you have optimism now that you're going to see more. But now that you've been in, inside the B\/E Aerospace for a while what are you seeing there? You talked about doing a new work, a new organizational structure, but what are you seeing as opportunities? Are there more things than you perhaps were aware of, when you originally went into the acquisition?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, I think there's a few more, but what we're seeing is just more in the categories we expected. So material and supply, both direct and indirect, our current forecast is much higher than what we originally planned in those particular areas. The revenue synergies again, weren't in our business case, but those are kind of new, those are -- we needed to get our teams together and start working on those. I spike out the Comlux as an example, but it really is truly an example where we were working this retrofit program just to put our cabin system in and now it's over twice the size, because we've been able to bring the interiors and we've got more of those in work. And I'm also encouraged with our government portfolio probably more so than I expected. They've got a series of program pursuits in play now where we can bring interior products collectively with our aviation and communication products into those program upgrade opportunities in the military markets. So, I'd say it's a mix of just more of what we expected and some new items particularly in the revenue synergy area.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, and then on the government side, you had some real upside in communications and navigation, what's happening there? Is this something that you see as sustained, that's been sort of a difficult business area for the last few years?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, remember that's got most of our short cycle business particularly our navigation for example. So we saw significant declines when we were in the cycle in the government business, in our core navigation GPS product business. We're coming out of that and short cycle business is the first to decline and also the first to grow out, and that's exactly what we're seeing. We're seeing now growth in some of those short cycle product lines going, and we're expecting that to continue going forward. The budget environment leads us to be optimistic, we've got more program opportunities. We've entered some new markets in the training and test range area that are giving us growth opportunities. So, I think it's just a \u2013 the result of an improving market and our ability to go capture a portion of that.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great.

Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe Patrick or Kelly. Just on the interior systems and maybe going back to what Rob was asking. There is clearly some movement out there with wide-bodies, you talked about the super first class coming down, a pickup in retrofit. We've got Boeing pushing further into the aftermarket. How should we think about the margins, with all of these moving pieces in that segment over the longer term, that 18.4% adjusted. Should we expect that to be stable? Should we see that lift with some of the synergies and then maybe how does some of the different sales to different channels affect that?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","I think the margins generally would be pretty stable now. I think you raise a good point. They are going to increase as we realize some of the synergies. But if you think about it just from a pricing or general operating or a gross margin perspective, it should be pretty stable with benefit from the synergies.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Do you see any pricing pressure out there, maybe more so in the aftermarket, that you've got to be mindful of?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Not new, I would there is always pricing pressure. As this is a competitive market, so there are different dynamics in a competitive field. But I wouldn't say any enhanced competitiveness. It's just same old, same old. We got to go fight it at each of these opportunities and put a value proposition that the airlines select us on.

I was wondering if you're seeing any signs of maturity in this market, in terms of the various products that are out there, but also what the customers are coalescing around as being the products and capabilities that they want?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, you know our opportunity here is centered around the Global Xpress broadband capability and where we're a value-added reseller of that capability. And so, it's just gone operational; it's just getting certified on the aircraft. So, we're kind of entering into that market space now. I think we're in the early phases so far. I'm pretty encouraged with our ability to compete with the new Global Xpress, even against solutions that have been in the market a little bit longer. It provides some real advantages to the connectivity solutions in the market.","So, look, this was an area we weren't addressing. We said it's opportunity for growth. It's a synergy area. We've got two now major airlines that have selected our solution and you know that it's not just putting the equipment on the aircraft, it includes the service annuity that goes with the utilization and subscription of using the data services. So, I'm pretty encouraged with the outlook here. We've got more program pursuits underway. Hopefully, I'll be telling you about some more wins in that space.","Having said that, I think there's still a lot of competitive dynamics. There's a lot of solutions in the marketplace. We're really not penetrating much in the air-to-ground environment, so those airlines that predominantly are looking for air-to-ground solutions, that's probably not our focus area. It's much more solutions that are over the ocean type applications.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So, just as a follow-up as far as the bottom-line is, do you think this sort of top-line growth you've been enjoying is sustainable for the next few years?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Oh, yeah. I think we're at the early stages of this broadband connectivity to the aircraft, very early stages. So, I'm pretty excited about the long-term opportunity this presents to us. And remember once we get the broadband connectivity, there is hosted services, there is applications, there is big data application opportunities for us. And so, we'll be prosecuting those opportunities.","I think the FOMAX is a really important program because we're now going to have the standard information exchanger on all the narrow-body aircraft moving maintenance and flight data down to the ground. That information has to get distributed, creates great opportunities for our ground network, our secure ground network to deliver the data to the airlines or to an OEM. So, I like how this space is evolving, and I think we're really well positioned to continue to play in multiple aspects in the market.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Just a couple of quick follow ups. Patrick, you had mentioned that the conformal accounting would be a benefit next year. Is it going to get up to the full $60 million benefit or is there still going to be some R&D to offset it like we're seeing happened just?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","As I mentioned, George, we're still kind of figuring out next year. But I would say it's not going to be the full $60 million.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then Kelly, would you be willing to comment as to what percentage of the B\/E seating business is actually to the super first class business? So how many coach seats you got to do to offset one loss of one of those?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say super first class is less than 10% of the total Interior Systems revenue.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you quantify how much of the sales were of those fighter jet avionics that got pushed out of the quarter?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","I'll do it this way, I think we would have been closer to mid single-digit growth if we didn't have these issues.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then with one quarter to go, it still seems like you have a pretty wide range on cash earnings. I know you narrowed the revenue, but just how should we think about where you are in the range and what the moving pieces would be to move you to the upper or lower end of it?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. I'll tell you this, Sam, I think ordinarily this is the quarter where we'd narrow our range. I think just given kind of the newness of Interior Systems just the number of moving parts, we decided to leave the range fairly wide. I would say given the performance of this quarter, if we were to narrow, we probably would have narrowed toward the upper end of the range, but I think there's just, there's enough dynamics associated with the numbers that we felt more comfortable with a wider range.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then Kelly, I just wanted to follow up your comment about the business jets, the typical summer slowdowns and shutdowns. So none of that has changed from your perspective from where you would have been say a quarter ago in terms of your thinking?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. No, not, not materially. I mean, there may be an airplane here or there, but nothing material, and it's nothing like what we've seen in the last three years or four years, where we always seem to get a material change here. And I think the commentary is much more around a stable environment here. So again, I'm becoming more optimistic that, that while we won't see a snapback in growth of production rates, if we can just alleviate the headwinds that we have this year of just inventory rationalization, we'll see growth next year in our bizjet OEM, which is great to have that headwind behind us and hopefully we can move on to a long-term growth profile here now for business aviation.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have now reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Palmer for closing remarks.","Adam Palmer - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you Julie. Thank you all for joining us in participating on today's conference call.

For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Candace, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on the website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note, today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, thanks, Ryan and good morning, everyone. Well, this has been a productive and exciting quarter in which we made significant progress in accelerating our return to growth, both in our core business as well as by expanding in emerging high-growth areas of focus for Rockwell Collins. And while there were quite a few highlights across our business, 3 really stand out in my mind:","First, we closed on our acquisition of ARINC on December 23, serving as a catalyst for creation of our new Information Management Services business segment, and I'll outline that further for you here today.","Second, as you know, we included the impact of sequestration in our original guidance for the year. We now expect the recent budget agreement will reduce this impact, resulting in an improved 2014 outlook for our Government Systems business.","And third, as anticipated, the successful ramp-up in production rates for the 787 has resulted in strong air transport, OEM and aftermarket performance.","And I think all 3 of these developments provide increased momentum for accelerating our return to growth.","As for our first quarter financial performance, our results were in line with our expectations as we generated modest top line sales growth and maintained 20% total segment operating margins in spite of revenue declines in our Government Systems business and the continued lack of recovery in business aviation.","Looking specifically at our Government Systems business, we continue to manage the impact of the overall U.S. DoD budget cuts. However, as I mentioned, our outlook is improving in light of the current budgetary environment.","The Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act, signed late last month, sets total federal discretionary spending above the sequestration level. And as a result, defense spending in the U.S. will rise about $22 billion in 2014 and about another $9 billion in 2015 from the anticipated sequester level. And as a result, we've increased our fiscal 2014 Government Systems outlook to now be down mid-single digits, an improvement from the mid- to high-single-digit decline we previously anticipated. This also further reinforces our belief that our Government business will be flat in 2015 before returning to some modest level of growth.","Turning now to Commercial Systems. We realized the strength in air transport OEM sales, primarily on the higher hardware delivery rates for the Boeing 787. Unfortunately, this was largely offset by the expected headwinds in the light end of biz jets, where OEM sales continue to struggle. As I look forward on OEM, we expect overall air transport revenue growth to remain robust with Boeing now producing 10 787s per month and A350 beginning to come online later this year. On the other hand, we don't see a biz jet recovery in the near term, with OEM sales expected to be down by low single digits for the year. We do expect to return to OEM growth in 2015, when we'll see an increased cadence of new aircraft equipped with our Pro Line Fusion avionics beginning to enter their entry into service, including the Lear 85 and the Legacy 450 and 500 aircraft. And I might add that we've recently expanded our content at Embraer with the selection of our Head-up Guidance System and Enhanced Vision System sensors options on both the Legacy 450 and 500 aircraft.","Turning now to commercial aftermarket. We saw strong growth, driven primarily by retrofit and spares, where we saw higher sales from regulatory mandates, cabin updates and delivery of spares to support the 787 entry into service. We do expect the aftermarket sales growth to taper off to the mid-single digits as the effect of the lumpy 787 spares give way to a more sustained growth level.","Now let me now shift to what I'm sure many of you are looking forward to, and that's our outlook on ARINC. Well, first of all, let me remind you why we bought ARINC. We have a vision of becoming a leader in the fast-growing aviation information management space, and ARINC substantially accelerates that vision. This deal brings together 2 great companies with complementary capabilities that, when combined, will allow us to provide a broader complement of services to our customers.","With the close of ARINC, we've now formed our new Information Management Service business, which we'll refer to as IMS, which combines ARINC and our flight services business that was formally a part of Commercial Systems.","Together, this new business provides the industry's broadest range of information management services, and let me characterize this a little bit for you.","First, in the commercial aviation or airline market, our business consists primarily of voice and data communication services between the air and the ground. This data link service is called GLOBALink, and it's used by many airlines throughout the world.","The catalyst for growth in GLOBALink business is, number one, the growing installed base of aircraft, but, more importantly, the enhanced data demand of the new modern aircraft. We also provide airline-to-airline ground messaging services called AviNet, and that will also increase in revenue as passengers' traffic grows.","The second area is in business aviation, and our business here includes global flight planning, trip support, cockpit and cabin voice and data communications, flight tracking, weather information and ground support services and is made up of our Ascend flight services business and ARINC Direct, which are industry leaders in international and regional trip support services.","The third area is airports, including communication and information systems designed to ease congestion and improve airport efficiency through passenger check-in, baggage, boarding and access control solutions.","And then finally, the fourth area is transportation and security, which includes train dispatching, information systems, as well as mission-critical security systems for nuclear power plants and defense-related facilities.","So for the 9 months that we'll own ARINC in fiscal 2014, we expect sales in the range of $400 million to $430 million. We also expect IMS to deliver EBITDA margins of about 20% in fiscal 2014.","The commercial and the business aviation, those first 2 sections that I talked about, will collectively make up about 2\/3 of the Information Management Services revenues and 75% to 80% of the EBITDA. It's also the highest growth area, which is organically growing double digits. The combination of our airports, transportation and security fill in the remaining 1\/3 of the business, and it's growing a little slower, but still a respectable mid-single digit.","All in, we see the IMS business, before synergies, growing in high single digits. And as I stated previously, we expect that overall growth to increase to double digits based on a number of revenue synergies that we've already started working on. Early on, these synergies will primarily be in those first 2 areas, in commercial aviation and business aviation, and I'm expecting the revenues to be about $10 million annually beginning in 2015, so pretty quickly, ramping up to greater than $50 million per year by the end of our 5-year outlook.","Now that we've closed and had a chance to get our teams together and engage in a closer look at the business, I'm even more confident in our ability to expand our Information Management Services business. We do plan to roll out more details of this new business segment and where we expect to capture these revenue synergies at our Investor Day on March 6, and Ryan is going to talk a little bit more about the Investor Day at the end of the call here today.","So let me bring this all back together. When we issued our guidance late last year, we accommodated for the potential headwinds that we saw. Since then, we've not seen any significant additional risks. And as I outlined today, there's reason to be more optimistic. As a result, I'm pleased to report that we've increased our full year fiscal guidance for fiscal 2014 based on the improved outlook for Government Systems and inclusion of ARINC in our estimate. This revised guidance includes sales in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.05 billion, an increase of $450 million from the previous guidance of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, and that's an increase of 7% to 10% from fiscal year '13.","So in summary, I'm excited about the opportunities that our new Information Management Service business will bring. We continue to make progress on our international growth strategy, and we see stability coming in Government Systems. And in Commercial Systems, the air transport market continues to be an area of strong growth, and it's only a matter of time before business aviation recovers. So I'm seeing tangible evidence that gives me confidence in the long-term growth of this company.","With that, let me turn it over to Patrick to take you through the financial details for the quarter.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of 2014. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, earnings per share, net income and operating cash flow.","Total company sales for the quarter increased $9 million, or 1%, compared to first quarter 2013 sales. Our first quarter sales included $6 million of inorganic ARINC revenue.","Net income was about flat for the quarter as a lower effective tax rate, driven by a tax planning strategy, and a gain on the sale of Kaiser Optical Systems were offset by ARINC transaction costs.","Earnings per share increased $0.02 to $0.96 due primarily to our share repurchase program.","Looking next to our operating cash flow for the first quarter, we used $38 million of cash compared to cash flow generation of $63 million during the same period last year. The lower cash flow for the quarter was due primarily to $60 million of higher employee incentive pay and $37 million of higher income tax payments.","As we turn to Slide 4, note that we've reclassified sales related to our flight services business previously included in Commercial Systems to our new Information Management Services or IMS segment.","Sales related to flight services were about $10 million in the first quarter of last year. With that said, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $521 million in the quarter, up 3% from $506 million in the first quarter of 2013. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $4 million, or 1%, to $286 million, primarily due to increased deliveries for the Boeing 787 aircraft, which was mostly offset by lower deliveries at the light end of business jets.","Aftermarket sales increased $19 million, or 10%, to $216 million due to higher air transport retrofits, regulatory airspace mandates, spares and service and support.","Commercial Systems' operating earnings increased 6% to $111 million in 2014, with operating margins expanding 50 basis points from 20.8% to 21.3%. The increase in operating earnings and margin was primarily due to the higher sales.","Now moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems' revenue decreased by 3% to $532 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, driven by the wind down of development programs as well as lower sales due to troop withdrawals in the Middle East. These headwinds were partially offset by increased hardware deliveries on both domestic and international programs.","Now looking specifically at our product categories. Sales of avionics increased $2 million, or 1%, from higher deliveries for the E-6B aircraft upgrade program as well as increases from a number of international programs. However, these increases were mostly offset by lower KC-46 and KC-10 development program sales.","Communication product sales declined $15 million, or 11%, primarily due to lower satellite and secure communication product and service sales resulting from the troop drawdown, partially offset by higher JTRS Manpack radios.","Surface solution sales increased $8 million, or 16%, from higher international FireStorm targeting system sales, partially offset by a reduction of effort on the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation Systems development program.","Finally, sales of navigation products declined by $9 million, or 19%, resulting from fewer deliveries of our handheld GPS receivers.","Government Systems' first quarter operating earnings decreased $6 million to $101 million, resulting in an operating margin of 19% compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from the lower sales volume.","Turning to Slide 6. You see our new segment, Information Management Services, which includes ARINC as well as our flight services business.","During the first quarter, ARINC contributed $6 million of revenue, which represented a partial week of revenue since the date of acquisition. All remaining revenues are related to the legacy Rockwell Collins flight service business.","Slide 7 provides an update of our total R&D investment through the first quarter of the year. Total spend decreased from 21.4% of sales to 20.4%, due primarily to lower customer-funded R&D as certain development programs in Government Systems wind down. During the quarter, company-funded R&D spend decreased $6 million and preproduction engineering spend increased $7 million as more effort was incurred on deferred programs such as the 737 MAX and CSeries. Looking to the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $950 million in total R&D.","Now moving to Slide 8. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, we issued $1.1 billion of long-term debt. Approximately $900 million of the long-term debt issuance was used for the ARINC acquisition, and the remainder was used to refinance $200 million of debt that matured in December. The balance of the ARINC acquisition was funded with commercial paper, and we plan to pay down the commercial paper balance over the course of the next few years.","At the end of fiscal 2013, we had debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 0.9. With the issuance of long-term debt and the incremental commercial paper in the first quarter to fund the ARINC acquisition, we are currently at about 2.4. I believe this level of debt still provides us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs, and I expect it to improve over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally comes later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of our share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we repurchased 235,000 shares at an average cost of $71.48, which brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 86 million shares or a $4.3 billion return to share owners. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was about $395 million.","So now, I'll go over our fiscal year 2014 expectations for ARINC on Slide 10. As we previously disclosed, we plan to divest ARINC's Aerospace Systems Engineering and Support business, also called ASES, which provides military integration and modification services. The results of ASES are treated as a discontinued operation.","I also want to remind you that these financial projections are subject to change as we complete the purchase price allocation for ARINC. However, we did want to provide you visibility into the expected impact of this acquisition on our fiscal '14 financial guidance.","We expect ARINC sales for fiscal 2014, which includes the period from December 23, 2013, to September 30, 2014, to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million, which is about a 7% increase over sales from the same period last year for ARINC. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for ARINC to be about 20% in fiscal 2014, or about $85 million. Compared to the same period last year, this represents roughly a 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA.","From an earnings per share perspective, we expect the combined impact of transaction-related items for ARINC, the gain on the sale of KOSI, along with the income from operations to ARINC, will be slightly accretive to total company results.","We are also expecting about $50 million of incremental operating cash flow from ARINC in fiscal year '14.","Looking ahead to 2015, we expect that ARINC will be increasingly accretive to earnings per share and drive stable cash flows along with top line sales growth in the high single digits. As we have previously disclosed, we believe that taking into account longer-term revenue synergies, we can sustain double-digit sales growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%.","We also expect incremental margins for ARINC to rival those of our commercial business because ARINC's [indiscernible] have ample capacity to grow revenue with relatively minor capital investments.","Now I'd like to turn to our final slide, Slide 11, where we provide the details of our updated fiscal year 2014 financial guidance.","Sales are now expected to be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5.05 billion, an increase of $450 million from the previous guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. As I mentioned previously, ARINC's sales are estimated to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million.","In addition, expectations for Government System sales have improved due to the passage of the Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act. We now expect Government System sales to be down mid-single digits compared to the prior guidance of being down mid- to high-single digits.","We've revised total segment operating margins from a range of 21% to 22% to a range of 20% to 21%. This reduction is due to the inclusion of ARINC. ARINC's operating margins are expected to be 9% to 10% in fiscal year 2014 and will be negatively impacted by intangible asset amortization and integration costs.","Our outlook for earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55, primarily due to the improved Government Systems outlook.","Our outlook for operating cash flow has increased by $50 million and is now expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million, primarily due to the incremental operating cash flows from ARINC.","Capital expenditures have increased $20 million to $160 million due to the inclusion of ARINC in our guidance.","And that completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The first one I had, I guess, is on ARINC and the 20% EBITDA margins. I think back in 2012, the stand-alone business that you now have may have been somewhere closer to 23% or 24%. And so I'm just curious, what has happened since then? Did it need to be reinvested in or something else as it applies to the accounting? And then the other question similarly is, do you have a ballpark estimate for proceeds on the divestiture of the 15%?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, let me take that, Myles. This is Patrick. As it relates to the difference between what you saw in FY '12 and what you're seeing today, I would characterize the difference as being mainly due to 2 things: One is their accounting process and practices are a little bit different than ours. They had, had some accounting changes that benefited 2012 that were non-recurring. And so some of it is just accounting. That's about half of it. The other half of it relates to the fact that there are certain shared costs between our continuing business and our discontinued business that we'll need to take out over time. That's reflected in some of the cost synergies that we have talked about in the past. And so I would anticipate that reflected as future EBITDA improvement. So it really doesn't reflect any incremental investment on our behalf, but more of those 2 factors. As it relates to proceeds from the sale of the ASES business, we're way too preliminary in the process to speculate on that. As you can see in the press release and you'll see in the Q later today -- or tomorrow actually, we're holding the net book value at about $74 million, but that's no indication of where our expected proceeds are going to be.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On ARINC, Kelly, just to take a step back on sales growth, looking at mid to high, I guess, single-digit growth this year then accelerating with some of the synergies, I know you don't want to get too far in front of this because you have your investor meeting coming up, but could you help flesh out exactly what is driving the top line growth? Because it doesn't look like it's been growing at that rate in the past several years. Is it market growth, is it market share gains you're expecting, sell-through to customers, new services, et cetera?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, it really is market growth. What we're seeing particularly, as I mentioned in the data comm area, is the newer airplanes are coming into service, and they're consuming a lot more data capability because they've got the onboard systems to communicate with the ground. So really, what we're seeing is the lift in just the new airplanes coming in the market driving that initially. And again, we see that as high-single-digit growth just with that organic business.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Has it been growing at that rate at the last several years? Or is this an acceleration?","Patrick E. Allen","The -- certainly, as we're looking at 2013 to 2014, we're seeing growth. Part of the growth is masked, I think. And I don't know what data you're looking at, Joe, but part of it is masked by the fact that the ASES business, which has almost entirely defense exposure, has been declining during that same time period. So if you take that and treat that separately, I think you'll see the underlying core growth of the ARINC commercial business is growing pretty nicely.","Robert K. Ortberg","But Joe, let me answer that question specifically. Yes, it is growing, and we're very pleased with the results this past year. So that core business is currently growing, and we expect it to continue to grow.","Operator","And your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question around the government -- the Government Systems margins. At 19%, it's obviously at the lower end of where we've been in the past couple of quarters. But I wondered if you can kind of walk us through maybe some of the moving pieces there, if it was related to mix or how the headwinds and incentive comp may have disproportionately hit that segment and the R&D helping Commercial Systems. So any color you can help give us there into what drove that number would be helpful.","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, Carter, I think if you look at the margins quarter-over-quarter this year to last year, first quarter is obviously always our lowest margin quarter just because of the volume. But if you couple that with higher incentive compensation expense, because we had that cumulative catch-up in the second quarter of last year, if you normalize for that, that would add about 0.5 points of margin to our first quarter results. So the underlying operating performance year-over-year was pretty, pretty stable for the Government Systems business.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No real differences in mix?","Patrick E. Allen","No.","Operator","And your next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just wanted to focus just for a moment here on your better outlook on defense. Could you be a little bit more specific? Your improved outlook, what actually got better as a result of Murray-Ryan? What specifically where -- maybe if you could talk about what programs were impacted, et cetera?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, let me remind you how we put our guidance together. We did a top-level macro analysis, assuming that sequestration was going to be implemented in this fiscal year, just like we had done the prior fiscal year. And from that analysis, we determined the top-level impact that we then discounted out of our forecast. This has improved from that. So we do not have the program-level detail yet. That's coming out, and we're combing through that. But what we've just done is adjusted in the same way we established that discount to begin with. We now have adjusted that based on a top-level analysis of these new budget numbers.","Operator","And your next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have an accounting question, Patrick. It's sort of related to ARINC. If I sum the goodwill and intangibles, it appears to exceed the purchase price of ARINC. Could you walk through that? And then related to this, as you now have a new business segment, how can you -- can you spend any funds, really adding to it externally? Or is it all going to be internal growth?","Patrick E. Allen","I would say this. With respect to the reconciliation of the ARINC purchase price, I would say yes, we do have almost kind of net asset -- net tangible assets of 0. So it's a pretty asset-light business and not a very working capital-intensive business. I think the fact that it's in information technology, heavily service oriented, sort of leads to that sort of thing. So yes, we're going to end up with a disproportionate amount of the purchase price allocated towards goodwill and intangible assets. And as it relates to the second part of your question -- what was the second part of your question, Howard?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I mean, typically as you've sort of created a new business segment, you've not only grown internally, but, Patrick, you've clearly added externally. How you're going to weigh that versus sort of the constraints that Moody's has put on your credit rating?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I would say this. We -- when we met with Moody's, we indicated that we still had an appetite for doing acquisitions, and they understood that. I would tell you this. I think that right now, the -- our focus is on the synergies that we can drive between ARINC and Rockwell Collins right now. However, there's certainly -- it certainly does provide a platform for additional acquisitions. And in our 5-year plan, we have accommodated some level of acquisition, obviously not to the dollar level of the ARINC acquisition, more in accordance with kind of our past practices of niche acquisitions.","Operator","And your next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to switch to the aftermarket. Kelly, could you talk or parse out a little bit the aftermarket growth in air transport? Obviously, 787 spares were important there, but you also talked about retrofits and mandates.","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes. So first of all, let me start with MRO, because as you recall, we saw the effect last year of some tear downs and parts going back into the system that had some impact on us, and we forecasted that, that was going to continue. And I would say our MRO has performed, based on our model, pretty well as we expected. So I still think that's going to be low-single-digit growth. I think that's about the right way to look at our MRO. The 787 spares are always lumpy, and they're big -- usually big dollars. And so that's why I mentioned we got some spares that actually came in a little faster than we anticipated. We had them in our plan, but we had them later in the year. So we'll see that continue to be lumpy as we go forward. And then we'll probably get our initial tranche of spares on the A350 right towards the end of our fiscal year as that airplane moves into service. In terms of retrofit, it's all around the mandates. We're seeing strong demand for the TCAS and Link 2000 activity. That's [indiscernible].","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So if you -- Kelly, if you took out the 787, is the growth rate in that high -- mid- to high-single-digit range for everything else? Or that's the wrong way to look about it -- look at it?","Robert K. Ortberg","I think the MRO is a little lower, and the retrofits and spares is around that level.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Kelly, so on Government Systems, does this budget deal -- I think you guys had expected flat next year and then we grow beyond that. Does the budget deal change your view of that? And then as a follow-up, can you talk about where you are on CSeries with Bombardier pushing the program out to the right?","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes. Well, let me address the first one. The -- as far as the budget deal, as I said in my prepared remarks, this gives us more confidence that we'll get to flat in 2015 as the budget environment is better than what we had previously forecasted. So yes, I'm more bullish that we'll be able to get to flat and get this government business starting to return to growth. So incrementally, we're still dealing with the overall budget environment. But again, incrementally, it's better than what we had forecasted with sequester. As far as CSeries, development delays on new aircraft programs are not a new phenomenon for any of us. We're focused on getting our work done and supporting Bombardier, and I can tell you we're aligned with their revised schedule. You'll have to talk about Bombardier about what the critical path is because they did not disclose that activity and why they've moved the schedule, but we're working with them to ensure that we mature our systems so that entry into service goes as good as possible. I might also add, David, I don't see any material impact to our spend in 2014 associated with the CSeries delay. We had some of that delay baked into our plan going forward. Where we'll see it is more in the revenue impact, and that will be 2015, where we'll have to take a close look at the CSeries revenue, depending on the status of the program.","Operator","And your next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee & Leach.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just, Kelly, here's a quick one on the business jet aftermarket. We've seen, obviously, that market has been slow to recover at the low end. When do you expect to see, I guess -- you've described, I guess, the turn where you've got some selected new models coming online, but the broader activity that we could see the aftermarket activity overall returning to higher single-digit growth?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, we're actually seeing pretty nice growth right now in cabin upgrades, our new Venue system, which is a digital, high-definition, audio-video system, particularly in VVIP kind of aircraft, and we expect that to continue. In terms of major avionics mods, that's been pretty soft. I'm looking for increases in the second half of this fiscal year. The next [indiscernible] purchase of additional Hawker 400s is a good example of a retrofit opportunity because that's a Pro Line 21 upgrade, which will drive some growth into the second half of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on ARINC. And as you're looking out over the next several years, I'd just be curious to know if there are any regulatory changes on the horizon that would lead to an acceleration of revenue growth at ARINC.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, the whole next-gen activity or CSAR activity in Europe will drive additional digital communication between air and the ground. And that communication will go over the ARINC and SITA networks. So yes, we see those activities driving additional growth.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up question. Do you have any updated thoughts on -- you mentioned briefly some initial thoughts on the biz jet recovery and that it will eventually happen. But as you're looking at that market today in light of some recent consolidation there, has your opinion at all kind changed of over the last 3 or 4 months here on where we are in that recovery and the potential inflection point on it?","Robert K. Ortberg","No. I'd say there is really no news from the OEMs. So still pretty sluggish -- a pretty sluggish environment at the low end. So we're just going to have to wait it out and see when we start to see a recovery. I'll also say that we'll start to see that recovery or the OEMs will be reporting that recovery in terms of new order outlook. It's going to take a while for that backlog increase to turn into rate increases. I would suspect they'd want a healthy backlog before they start increasing rates. So again, we aren't calling for a snapback in this. What we're calling for is some growth in 2015, mostly driven by new platform entries, not existing rate increases.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Did you change the capitalized preproduction engineering in terms of your assumptions for the remainder of the year? Just because if I look at this first quarter run rate, obviously, annually it gets you slightly above the $170 million. I'm just trying to think about it, is it -- should we look at it as similar in every quarter? Does it ramp up and then peak somewhere in the beginning -- in the middle of the year and then start to ramp down? Patrick, I don't know if you can help with that.","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. Sam, we haven't changed our overall forecast for deferred preproduction engineering. I would say there has been some variability around our ability to predict that. And yes, it'll change from quarter to quarter based upon the relative mix of what our engineering workforce is working on, whether they're working on company-funded, customer-funded or deferred engineering-type projects. So you will see some variability around the amount we need to capitalize on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So we're sticking to our $170 million forecast for deferred engineering. Is there some variation around that? I think quite possibly.","Operator","And your next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So your company-funded R&D was down $6 million in the quarter, and yet your full year, you're looking for the total R&D spend up $30 million to $950 million. At one point, I think you were looking for company R&D to be about flat. Can you give us some sense, follow-up to Sam's question, if, in fact, you're still looking for deferred engineering where it was? Are we going to see any pickup -- or are we still looking for flat in terms of customer R&D and company R&D?","Patrick E. Allen","Short answer is yes, we are expecting that. And what I would say is what you're going to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis, Cai, is you're going to see some mix shift between company-funded and deferred R&D. And so in the coming quarters, what you're going to see is that company-funded R&D is going to grow in aggregate, whereas the deferred R&D is going to be flat to slightly down.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping -- first, is there anything that you can tell us to help bound or provide a framework for the commercial aftermarket opportunity as a result of the regulatory mandates? It seems like that's becoming a bigger positive. And then just a clarification separately. Patrick, I think you mentioned that incremental margins at ARINC could rival the commercial business. Is that a temporary phenomenon because of the benefits of synergies, margin expansion, because of that? Or was that a normalized comment?","Patrick E. Allen","Let me take the first part of your question, or the last part of your question first with respect to ARINC and the margins. That was a -- I'll say that was a more normalized comment. We view the sales increase on ARINC, particularly in that 2\/3 of the business that Kelly identified as being associated with commercial aviation, business aviation, as having similar margin characteristics as our commercial business. And therefore, we think we'll be able to drive incremental margins with those sales. Now in the short term, you can couple that with some cost synergies that we'll be taking out over the course of, let's say, the next 1 to 2 years. So there'll be some additional margin opportunity with that. But from a normalized perspective, we do see pretty high incremental margins.","Robert K. Ortberg","Let me talk a little bit about the mandate question. So we don't break out specifically the revenues around the mandates, but let me help you think about that. The mandates are really driven by 2 changes: a TCAS change and a data link change. We are seeing, as we anticipated, the airlines getting in line, particularly the larger airlines, to get those mods done as a part of their normal maintenance, so they don't get in a situation of having to take an airplane out of service to incorporate the mod. The -- we expect that to accelerate throughout the year. Our first quarter performance indicates that I think we've got that sized about right.","Operator","And your next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","With the D&A at ARINC, the D&A of what you're projecting, like $15 million a quarter, does that continue for the foreseeable future? Or when does the amortization part of it stop?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, certainly, there'll be some level of intangible asset amortization for the foreseeable future. I'll tell you, for the first couple of years, we're going to see relatively higher amortization. I'm going to say the amortization related to the acquisition is going to be about $27 million in 2014, about $38 million in 2015. And then toward the end of our planning period in '17, '18, you'll see that coming down as some of the shorter-lived intangibles, like backlog, get burned off. But probably steady-state run rate of $25 million, $27 million. And that's just -- and just to be clear, George, that's just the incremental amortization related to the acquisition, not their total D&A.","Operator","And your next question comes from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions on biz jet. One, on the Learjet 85, to what extent was the delay there anticipated in your guidance for the year? And is there any risk associated with that? And then second, the acquisition of Beechcraft by Textron, to what extent is that an opportunity for you to maybe gain a bit more share back at Cessna? Or to what extent is it maybe a risk?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, the Lear 85 is exactly per our plan, so there's no impact associated with that in fiscal '14. We had anticipated that. As far as the Cessna and Beechcraft combination, first of all we think that's very positive. It provides a much stronger financial backing for Beechcraft for the long run. And as you know, they're an important customer to us. But so is Cessna. Cessna is a very important customer. Let me remind you that we have lost share at Cessna, and it's because we did not have a product in time for some of the upgrades that they were doing. We now do have that product available. And so we're excited that this new combination will give us upside opportunity to look for new opportunities with the combined entity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Patrick, couple of debt-related questions. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what your sort of quarterly run rate will be for interest going forward from here now that ARINC has closed. And also, what do you expect the debt paydown schedule to be roughly over the next couple of years?","Patrick E. Allen","Sure, Rob. I would say that the quarterly run rates is going to be around $50 million a quarter. As for the debt paydown, a lot of it will depend upon our cash flow. But our hope is to get the bulk of the commercial paper paid back over about a 2-year period.","Operator","And your next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Patrick, is it possible to walk through the difference between the $50 million at-the-midpoint increase in the cash flow outlook and the $85 million of EBITDA you've highlighted for the year for ARINC? Or, in other words, what's -- of the non-recurring ARINC, what's cash? And is there any change to the projection for the legacy business on [indiscernible]?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, I would say -- Noah, I'd say that there's really 2 main impacts of -- well, actually, 3 main impacts of -- related to the cash. The first is we've got some -- the transaction costs. The second thing is integration costs. Both of those, we took out of our EBITDA estimate to come to normalized EBITDA. And the third is the taxes, of course, on the -- well, interest and taxes on the acquisition.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So nothing from the legacy business?","Patrick E. Allen","There may be some slight incremental cash flow opportunity resulting from the Government Systems' increased outlook, but not significant, probably in the range of $5 million to $10 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord Genuity.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Kelly, I can appreciate the better outlook here for Government Systems here in the United States. Can you comment on any changes you've seen internationally over the last few months within Government Systems, specifically in terms of maybe any opportunities accelerating or getting pushed to the right? And specifically, what would you highlight as maybe 2 or 3 of the key programs that perhaps internationally again represent perhaps the most opportunity for upside within that segment in '14 or into '15?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, so we're, in some cases, riding the OEMs' tail on some international pursuits. So we're seeing good demand from Boeing as they sell things like P-3s into these new countries, and that's driving some opportunities. We've got C-130 upgrades, small fleet upgrades, happening throughout the regions. We will see opportunities in the Middle East for follow-on targeting systems. As Patrick outlined this quarter, we had pretty good revenue growth in our surface portfolio driven by those targeting systems, and we've got some follow-on business associated with that. So I'd highlight those as the key drivers for us going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one on the 787. Where are you guys currently at in terms of your production rate? And where are -- are the incremental margins on that platform still a bit of a drag? And if so, when do you think you can get to sort of in-line incrementals on that with your legacy commercial business?","Patrick E. Allen","Michael, I'd say 2 things. First of all, I think we're fully synced up with Boeing at this point. So our production rate matches theirs at roughly 10 a month. And in terms of incremental margins, as we had talked about in the past, the Boeing 787 for the next -- I'd probably say the next couple of years is going to come at lower margins than our typical incremental margins. Now that said, still pretty healthy margins, well in excess of our -- of the Commercial Systems' overall operating margins, but less than the incremental margins. And I would expect that condition to continue probably through 2015 and begin to abate in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I ask Carter's earlier question on Government Systems' margins a different way, what needs to happen for the segment margins to go back to the 20% range? Is it just timing, better pricing, reduction of cost structure? And when do you think you'll get back to those levels?","Patrick E. Allen","I think sales growth is probably the biggest thing. I mean, I think once we start returning to growth, I think you'll start seeing the segment operating margins begin to expand. Now that said, 20% is not far from where we are today. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 20% sometime this year. So I think we're in the ballpark right now. I'm very happy with the margin performance of the Government Systems business over the course of the last few years as sales have been declining. But if we get a little uplift from sales, I would think that we'll get back up to that 20% level very quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had a couple of follow-ups. Kelly, the first one is just to continue on the aftermarket discussion. We've been hearing that used aircraft are seeing some more lease extensions here and that the part activity may be swelling a little bit. Are you seeing this yet at all in competition from surplus parts?","Robert K. Ortberg","We are not. I'm hopeful that we will start seeing. I've been reading that myself. But no, we are not yet seeing that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- so it sounds like that could come possibly. Two quick ones, Patrick. R&D at ARINC, I think your guidance held static for the company despite the inclusion of ARINC. So does that tell us anything about R&D spend at ARINC? And then quickly on the tax rate cadence for the year given that the first quarter here looked a little bit low.","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. As ARINC's R&D, what -- I would tell you this. We haven't gone through the process of looking at how they account for research and development versus how we do. So I think the jury is still out as to exactly how much ARINC R&D is. What I'd tell you is regardless of how much it is, it's not going to change the round -- well, around $950 million in total spend. That's not -- I don't think that's going to change. But I couldn't tell you today sitting here right now exactly how much R&D is at ARINC. They tend to charge most of their R&D to programs that don't break it out separately. And so we may have a little bit of an accounting change to do. As it relates to the tax rate cadence, we were low this quarter. We've forecasted a tax rate of about 30%. And so what that implies, obviously, is that we're going to see an increased tax rate over the course of the next 3 quarters. And I wouldn't say, I don't think -- I don't -- I'm not looking at a big lump in any one quarter going forward, so I would just kind of smooth it out from here going forward.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Did you say previously that you had expected 1 quarter with some help? Was with that this quarter? Or is that some other quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, there were really 2 events. This tax planning idea, we weren't sure which quarter it was going to hit in, so we didn't really commit to the quarter. But it turns out it was first quarter. The other thing that's going to hit us is the settlement of some outstanding [ph] tax years. We anticipate that some of them will occur either next quarter or the third quarter. We're not sure yet but just depending upon the timing of how negotiations go. And that could provide a modest benefit but will not be as significant as this tax planning strategy we had in the first quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. Kelly, maybe if you could just update us on these unannounced wins that have been hanging out there for a while, kind of current -- how many, current status, when we might hear something? And then also on the A350 there, I think there was a comment in your 10-K about you picked up some share on the A350 over the course of the last year. Could you just maybe comment on what exactly that relates to and how much of a share pickup it represents?","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes, the share gain is for a system called the rudder\/break pedal assembly. This is the mechanical structure, electric mechanical structure. If you recall, we entered that market on the 787 where we provide the whole pilot controls. The 787 also includes a yoke and steering wheel column. The Airbus aircraft do not. So we penetrated now Airbus with our mechanical systems business, and that's an increase in content, a modest increase in content for us on the A350 going forward. I'm sorry, what was your...","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your unannounced wins, how many. And any update on timing there?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, as you know, the timing is really not driven by us. I was hopeful that we'd see some of those announced here already. We'll have to look towards EBACE and NBAA as the timing opportunities. That's typically when we see these come out. And there's no change in the number of platforms that we've pursued or won since the last time. There's been really no new activity in new airplanes at the -- in business aviation.","Operator","And your last question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had 2 quick follow-ups. One was for Patrick. Patrick, did the comp expense accrual for the year tick up on the guidance? I just don't know how that would work with ARINC being folded in. And then for Kelly, could you remind us where we are on JTRS for this year? What's kind of in the guidance? Is it opportunity or risk, specifically as it relates to the Manpack?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. Myles, as it relates to the incentive compensation, it did tick up just a hair as a result of the increase, but not significantly.","Robert K. Ortberg","And the JTRS comment, for fiscal '14 we have production of existing contract activity for low rate Lot 1, and we also have production starting in the back half of the year and deliveries starting for the low rate initial production Lot 2. That was one -- Lot 2 was an award that we did -- just recently got. So we firmed up all of our JTRS backlog for our fiscal '14 sales.","Operator","And there are no further questions.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Mike, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure. Please note, today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking.

These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Well, thanks Ryan and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We grew our topline sales by 12% and delivered total segment operating margins greater than 20%. And due to the improved earnings expectations for our new Information Management Services business we were able to once again raise the mid point of our earnings per share guidance. I think these results demonstrate that the growth strategies that I highlighted at our Investor Day in March and we discussed during the last call are working.","Let me briefly remind you that those growth strategies are in four primary areas. First, leveraging our new growth platform of information management service. Second, capitalizing on the market share gains with the new OEM platforms that will be entering into service. The third area, expanding our international business and fourth positioning for the new defense environment.","And during this past quarter we made progress on all fronts and let me highlight a few specific examples. I'll start by giving you an update on our information management services business. Here we continue to make good progress in achieving our integration objectives and as I mentioned last quarter we're already realizing some of the short-term synergies.","During the quarter the Legacy air business had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.6% and its commercial and business aviation portfolio grew 13% on a pro-forma basis. And remember that the aviation portfolio that grew 13% here is the economic engine of that segment. So I feel really good about coming out of the shoes with two good quarters and I remain encouraged about our ability to leverage this new growth platform.","Moving now to the OEM front. During the quarter we achieved a number of important milestones on new programs in both our commercial and government markets. Last week at Farnborough it was announced that we were selected along with BAE Systems to provide the integrated flight control electronics or fly-by-wire system for the new Boeing 777X. It\u2019s a great win and it\u2019s just the first of what I hope will be more to come for this new airplane. And this is the first selection, so we\u2019re one of one and I like our chances of gaining share from what we have today on the legacy 777 aircraft.","In business aviation, we recently completed all of our development and certification work for the Embraer Legacy 500 and that\u2019s expected to receive type certification within the next few weeks. This will mark the fourth Pro Line Fusion equipped aircraft to enter into service following the Gulfstream G280 and the Bombardier Global 5000 and Global 6000 and all told right now we\u2019ve got about 150 aircraft currently flying with the Pro Line Fusion system and we\u2019re getting great feedback from the users. And there is still more than a dozen aircraft types yet to roll out. So we\u2019ve still got a lot of Pro Line Fusion growth in front of us.","Now on the government side, we recently delivered our generation three Helmet Mounted Display system, the Lockheed for the F-35 aircraft. We\u2019ve overcome all the technical challenge associated with this new technology and this generation three baseline will deliver improved performance for the pilot. We\u2019re also making good progress on another -- a number of other key programs in government systems like the KC-46 and KC-390 where we\u2019re now finalizing our systems and getting ready to transition those programs from development to production.","Now, preparing our government business for the future defense environment means that we\u2019ve got to go out and win and get positions on new programs but it also means we\u2019ve got to take a hard look at our existing portfolio and shape it in a way that will accelerate our return to business growth. Earlier this year, we divested of Kaiser Optical Systems or KOSI. And as you read in the release this morning, we\u2019ve entered into agreement now to sell our military satellite communication systems business formally known as Datapath and they manufacture and service ground based satellite communication systems, primarily for the U.S. Army.","This business has declined rapidly over the last three years due to the wind down in Iraq and Afghanistan and it's been a major contributor to our overall government systems revenue decline. This move is a part of our strategy to reshape our government systems business to focus on the core products and solutions that best fit our plan for future growth.","With the Datapath divestiture, we've revised our outlook for government systems to now be down low-single-digit from the previous mid-single-digit decline guidance. It also takes the major future headwind out of the equation for our government systems business.","Now before I turn the call over to Patrick to walk you through the financials, let me briefly address what's going on in our various end markets. There really hasn\u2019t been a lot of change in our outlook for government systems. A couple programs that I\u2019ve highlighted in the past that we've been keeping a very close eye on are the KC-10 Avionics upgrade program and the JTRS Manpack program. We did have a milestone decision meeting for the production approval of KC-10 upgrade program in the last quarter; we've got a few minor action items to clean up there before getting contract turn on. So that's really good news on the KC-10 front.","This will drive hardware sales force in fiscal 2015. On the JTRS Manpack program, we do need another LRIP a lot to be awarded to bridge to the full scale production program that's now got delivery slated out in fiscal year '16. So without another LRIP lot award, we\u2019d likely see another production break like we've experienced this year on our Manpack production. And this could have a couple of points of impact to our overall government systems fiscal year \u201815 revenue. So we continue to work this issue with the Army but as of yet, we don\u2019t have a definitive contract or a commitment from the Army for another l-rep lot so that\u2019s something we continue to work over the next quarter.","Now in business aviation, we saw a mid single digit growth in the aftermarket and a flattish quarter for OEM sales. During the last few quarters we, have seen bus-jet service and support via relative area of strength as a number of aircraft that were sold in the prior peaks of the cycle are rolling off of warranty and we do expect that trend to continue. As I look ahead, we expect a very challenging environment in light end of the OEM market, but do anticipate continued relative stability in mid and heavy bus-jets. And as we have said we do expect the growth in this area to be fueled by new entries into service.","And then finally the air transport market continues to be very strong with OEM growth driven by deliveries on the Boeing 787 and in the fourth quarter we expect to see Airbus start to ramp up the production for A350 which should give us a little bit of revenue lift yet this year, but will be a fiscal year \u201815 growth story for our commercial business.","In the aftermarket, the markets playing out about as we expected. We\u2019re seeing that non-discretionary MRO being driven by traffic partially offset by impacts of recycling. And on the discretionary side we are seeing good demand for the European mandate and of course pairing is driven by timing of new aircraft deliveries. Our original production or projections for the full year aftermarket was mid single-digit growth and that\u2019s about where I expect that we\u2019ll end up.","So in summary, it\u2019s another solid quarter and our teams are executing our plans to accelerate growth and increase shareholder value.","So, with that let me turn it over to Pat to walk you through the details of the quarter.","Patrick Allen","Thanks, Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I\u2019d now like to walk you through today\u2019s presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of 2014. I\u2019d like to begin on Slide three, where we highlighted our total company\u2019s third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. Total company\u2019s sales for the quarter increased a $132 million or 12%, compared to the third quarter of last year. Our third quarter sales included a $134 million of revenue from ARINC business acquired in December of this year.","Income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations increased slightly during the quarter, primarily due to the incremental operating earnings from ARINC and lower taxes, which was partially offset by lower operating earnings from government systems, higher interest expense from the debt financing for the ARINC acquisition and higher employee benefit related costs.","As we turn to slide four, commercial systems achieved revenue of $583 million in the quarter, up 6% from $551 million in the third quarter of 2013. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $29 million or 9% to $338 million, primarily due to increased deliveries for Boeing 787 aircraft and increased customer funded development program sales, which were partially offset by lower deliveries at the light end of the business jet market.","Aftermarket sales increased $5 million or 2% to $228 million due to higher service and support sales, higher 747-8 and 787 spare sales and partially offset by lower retrofit sales.","As we look into the fourth quarter of 2014, we're going to have some pretty tough comps in the air transport aftermarket due to a number of lumpy retrofits the benefit us in the fourth quarter last year. I do expect this will be a one quarter phenomenon that won't trend in the next year.","Commercial systems operating earnings were about flat with last year with operating margins decreasing 150 basis points from 23.8% to 22.3%. Now while operating earnings benefited from lower company funds and research and development expense, operating margins were impacted by higher employee benefit related costs and less favorable incremental margins associated with higher sales related to customer funded development programs.","Moving on to slide five. Note that the results of the Datapath have been reclassified discontinued operations as a result of pending sale of that business which we expect to be completed in our fourth quarter. During the third quarter, Government Systems revenue decreased by 6% to 535 million, driven by lower hardware deliveries at E-6 program, decreased development effort on programs such as KC-46 and KC-10 as these programs are transitioning into production and lower deliveries of JTRS Manpack radios.","These decreases were partially offset by higher F-15 revenues and an increase in hardware deliveries of Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems. Now Government Systems third quarter operating earnings decreased 13 million to 112 million resulting in an operating margin of 20.9% compared to 22% in the third quarter last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from the lower sales volume, higher employee benefit related costs and the absence of certain favorable program adjustments that benefited the prior year. These were partially offset by a better mix of higher margin hardware sales and other end cost saving initiatives that we've begun.","Turning to slide six, you see Information Management Services, which includes ARINC as well as our legacy flight services business. During the third quarter, ARINC contributed $134 million of revenue and the flight services business contributed $12 million. On a pro forma basis, Information Management Services sales increased 3% over the prior year. Information Management Services commercial and business aviation related sales increased about 13% over the prior year on a pro forma basis. This increase however was partially offset by decreases in ARINC\u2019s airports and the transportation and security business. These declines were due to the completion of efforts on certain projects in the airport\u2019s business and the winddown of a government program company exited in the security business.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the growth in the Aviation related business and we continue to execute our revenue synergy plans as we leverage our businesses strong customer relationship. Operating margins for Information Management Services were 14.4% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. And the ARINC\u2019s standalone adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter was 21.6%, albeit good mix of higher margin commercial and business aviation related sales.","Looking next to slide seven, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $237 million of operating cash flow compared to $309 million last year. The decreased cash generation resulted from $94 million in higher income tax payments, $60 million in higher employee incentive compensation pay, and these were partially offset by $54 million in lower pension plan contributions and other working capital changes.","Slide eight provides an update of our total R&D investment through the third quarter of the year. During the first nine months of the year, total spend decreased slightly from 687 million to 683 million. Company funded R&D decline 12 million due to reduction in R&D efforts on various next generation business jet avionics development programs.","Customer funded R&D declined $11 million due to development programs winding down in government systems which was partially offset by an increase in commercial systems customer funding. Preproduction engineering investment increased due to higher spends on the Boeing 737MAX, the Airbus A350 and Bombardier C-Series and Global 7000\/8000 development programs. And looking to the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $950 million in total R&D.","Now moving to slide nine, which shows the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. In the first quarter, we issued $1.1 billion of long-term debt, approximately 900 million of which was used for the ARINC acquisition and the remainder was used to refinance $200 million of our debt that matured in December. The balance of the ARINC acquisition was funded with commercial paper. And we currently plan to pay down the bulk of that commercial paper balance to the beginning of FY16.","As a result of the ARINC acquisition, our current debt-to-EBITDA ratio is down to 2.2. I believe this level of debt still allows us the necessary cost effective access to fund our capital needs and I do expect it to decline in the fourth quarter as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally results later in the year and we begin to pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the third quarter is detailed on slide 10. During the quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares at an average costs of $77.99. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 88 million shares or $4.4 billion returned to share owners. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $305 million.","On to slide 11, where we provide the detail of our updated fiscal year 2014 financial guidance, we have updated earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55 per share from the previous range of $4.40 to $4.55. The improvement in the bottom end of the range is due primarily to an improvement in our outlook for the operating earnings of ARINC. Based on this, we now expect Information Management Services operating margin to be about 13% up from the previous guided range of 11% to 12%.","In addition due to the pending sale of Datapath and to narrow the ranges as we are entering the fourth quarter we have updated our guidance for sales, operating margins and operating cash flow. We now expect total sales in the range of 4.9 billion to 4.95 billion, compared to the previous range of 4.95 billion to 5.05 billion. We now expect total operating margins of about 21% compared to the previous guidance range of 20% to 21%.","Operating cash flow is expected to be about 650 million, in the middle of our previous range of 600 million to 700 million and all other areas our financial guidance for the fiscal year are unadjusted from previously provided in our second quarter earnings call.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller if you have further questions simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we\u2019ll answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). First question is from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Kelly, I was wondering if you could just comment on Datapath and whether you might have some other paths as the government systems portfolio that you might be thinking of selling? And what sort of timeline we could have for that?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, as we\u2019ve laid out Rob, the major impact that we\u2019ve seen causing decline in our government business has been around the U.S. Army ground soldier activity, ground network activity and this has been a big component of it. So, getting this portfolio in someone else's hands I think is a good move for us, really positions our government business to get to that stability that we've been looking for.","As far as the rest of the portfolio, we continue to look at that. This was certainly the major component that we wanted to deal with. And so, I'm pleased to have this deal done so that we can move on with the growth area and get our team focused on the areas that provide growth for us in the market.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","After this roughly how much of your sales are left into the land area?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, the major components will be GPS receivers, handheld GPS receivers. And as you know, we've seen pretty significant decline and we\u2019ve kind of bottomed our sales out there. And then, we've got the JTRS Manpack radio segment that continues to go on. Other than that, most of our army focuses in the aviation side going forward. I don't in front of me have the total magnitude of those dollars.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question is from David Strauss with UBS.","David Strauss - UBS","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi David.","David Strauss - UBS","Patrick, on the ARINC amortization, can you -- are we -- are the books close now and can you talk about, I think before you were looking at $23 million in tangible amortization this year and then moving up to $31 million, can you talk about kind of where those numbers are now?","Patrick Allen","","Yes. David, the way I\u2019d describe it is, the books aren\u2019t closed on the amortization yet but they are rapidly closing. So in terms of the amortization on a run-rate basis, next year it will be about $26 million and that compares to about $19 million in 2014 for the first three quarters.","David Strauss - UBS","Okay. And Patrick, can you talk about where we are now for the comp accrual for the full year, what you\u2019ve got baked in? ","Patrick Allen","We're accrued right at about 100%.","David Strauss - UBS","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hi, good morning guys.","Kelly Ortberg","","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just a quick question and clarification on the IMS numbers you gave. Based on the split you gave at the Investor Day, if the aviation piece was up 13% as you said, it would imply I think that the airport and transport business was down sort of 25-30 in the quarter. Is that number right and if so, what should we be thinking about from a sequential comparison standpoint in that portion of the business as we look over the next couple of quarters? Is that something that hit this quarter and then we\u2019re sequentially flat from here or how should we think about that?","Kelly Ortberg","","First of all, I think your numbers are pretty close, Carter. And what I\u2019d say is I think from a sequential perspective, sequentially it should be that piece of the business should be relatively more stable sequentially.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","","Carter, let me just add.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Yes.","Kelly Ortberg","","Remember that that business is not the annuity run rate kind of business like the core aviation and we have project related revenue. And this happened to be a quarter where we didn't have near as much milestone deliveries and you\u2019re going to see that business, be a little bit more lumpy than the core aviation segment. But again remember that the core aviation segment is driving the economics of that business segment.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","And what kind of lead times and project sort of from booking to completion and visibility do you have in another side of the business that\u2019s lumpy?","Kelly Ortberg","I\u2019d say they\u2019re typically about like our government systems business, so we\u2019ve got generally pretty good visibility. These are projects where we go do some engineering work and then do installations that either in airport or security nuclear power plant. So, we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility, but the program timing just tends to drive that quarter-on-quarter performance.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","All right, thanks for the color Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Sam.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margins in the commercial systems business just clearly not much in terms of the incremental margin. So is that a mix issue, is it something with the incentive comp, is there way to think about when we can get that back to that 40% to 50% run rate that you\u2019ve always targeted?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Sam, what I\u2019d describe is that there is couple of different rabbits running and you hit on two of them. One is we did see a mix issue. We\u2019ve gotten an increased amount of customer funded [NRE] on the commercial side of the business which is a good thing, but it comes at lower margin than our product sales. And then the second thing I referred to in my prepared remarks was employee benefit cost. And that includes both incentive compensation as well as some higher medical cost this quarter. On incentive compensation piece, if you remember last year, we accrued a very large portion of our incentive compensation in the second quarter associated with the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. So we had a disproportionate amount of incentive comp in last year\u2019s second quarter and less in the third and fourth quarter. So that\u2019s what\u2019s providing the negative comp there. That's roughly about half a point of margin on the commercial system side and then the medical costs. We're seeing some unfavorable trends, but that's one of these things and it\u2019s hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter; it\u2019s driven by large claims. So hopefully that won\u2019t be a recurring issue.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Kelly, just maybe as a big picture on the biz jet OE, you've been pretty -- given us a lot of color and general like on the softness for this market on the lower end. It sounds like at best this year it\u2019s going to be flat with FY13 and I know that you're going to be guidance in a couple of months but we're thinking about \u201815. Are you seeing any sort of rate of change in the last month or two or any discussions coming out Farnborough that give you more confidence on the lower end of the market?","Kelly Ortberg","No, not on the low end. Where there is, what I'll say, good news at the low end, it's probably the M2 aircraft and that's not a platform where we have a position. So for our platforms, no, I\u2019m just not seeing anything that changes our outlook on the low end. Where we will see a lift will be the new entries in the service, in the legacy program I talked about is one of those that will drive some growth force going into next year.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay.","Kelly Ortberg","But unfortunately, I'm not saying anything in the OEM front that would raise the tide of say CJ deliveries next year.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay. And just related to that any reason on the aftermarket side where you are seeing higher utilization rates or anything like that from\u2026","Kelly Ortberg","","Yes, the aftermarket is actually good. We are seeing, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are seeing a roll off of warranty and that will continue to play and give us a little tailwind. But remember most of our contracts in this area are on a flight hour basis so the more flight hours the better the revenue. So we continue to see that growth being pretty good. As far as the discretionary I would it\u2019s kind of the same as the OEM, the bigger the airplane the better the discretionary component of the aftermarket, the smaller, the softer. We\u2019re seeing updates of avionics and cabin, particularly our high definition venue system is doing quite well in the aftermarket and we expect that will continue.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","Good morning.","Ryan Miller","","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","I wanted to ask a clarification question and then a more formal question. So Patrick first on the amortization 100 million run rate for next year I think that\u2019s what you are referring to, the 26 per quarter?","Patrick Allen","","No, it\u2019s 26 is for the full year for ARINC.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","For ARINC. And I am talking about the amortization of the development of the deferred.","Patrick Allen","","Okay. I don\u2019t think we addressed that. ","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Patrick Allen","That is going to be just one second here. It\u2019s going to be about $50 million next year.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","Is that a total number or is that net?","Patrick Allen","","It\u2019s a total amortization of our deferred engineering.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","Okay and I wanted to ask you how that trends begins the changes in R&D as you get into the home stretch on a bunch of these development programs. So if we were to put the two numbers together, how we should think about a year-over-year change? And then Kelly, I just wanted to ask you about the activity in core spares. So taking out provisionings and retrofits, just what you are seeing in air transport spares in terms of growth and how customer behavior might be changing there if at all?","Patrick Allen","So, as it relates to the trend in R&D, I think what we've said kind of over the long-term and we're still putting their plans together for \u201815, but over the long-term. We expect the trend in research and development on the commercial system sight to be relatively flat as a percentage of sales. So, I think you are going to see it rise in nominal terms overtime, but not as a percentage of sales.","Kelly Ortberg","And then in terms of the run rate spares, if you take the all the initial provisioning out, I'd say the run rate spares kind of go with delivery of the aircraft and the delivery rate with the exception that we are seeing this recycling phenomenon. And it is impacting some sparing primarily in the U.S. it's primarily a U.S. airline phenomenon, we are not seeing really that being impacted in the international market.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So Kelly, what kind of growth rate do you, can you home down to a growth rate in core spares, when we take out the sales associated with [OE] deliveries?","Kelly Ortberg","I would, I don't have that right in front of me, but I think it's going to track very closely to the OEM delivery growth rate.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I want to try to address the capital question, I mean Kelly you talked about getting out, you announced the discontinuation of data path and it looks like that\u2019s a modest proceeds, you are going to receive modest proceeds for that. But as you look at the rest of the business and as you look at sort of ideas to invest in the company; first, why didn't you try to fix the business and then second when you talk about looking for growth opportunities could you be a little more specific in terms of how is the technology advantaged that you want to kind of build a wall around things that you are going forward?","Kelly Ortberg","","Well you have several choices when you got a business that's declining like this, you can ride through it because you expect the recovery and then you just manage the cost through that period. You can invest in the next generation of product line to leapfrog. As I look is this the fundamental issue was not that we performed poorly on the Datapath integration and acquisition, the fundamental issue is the end market is not there.","So to put investment dollars in redesigning or developing new sitcom products looking in the tooth of what the army is doing with their [winpy] overall network and funding of that just isn\u2019t a good choice. So then you look at shut it down, the streamline it as much as possible and we felt that this was the best move going forward to let the portfolio go to someone who can see some value in it.","I just didn't see the future market opportunities for us and holding on to a piece of business that doesn't have a future and by the way when a business is declining it distracts management because you spend a lot of time on that. So this move is going to get our team focused on the things like core avionics upgrade bringing commercial aviation technology into the military market, growing that international marketplace in these emerging regions that's where I want my government team focused.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Sound pretty good to me, thank you.","Operator","","Next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Yes, thanks so much. So you said you\u2019re still looking for 950 in overall R&D and so and maybe you\u2019ve answered this, but is commercial at one point look like it was going to be flat which would require a huge step up in the fourth quarter. Maybe give us some of the pieces of how we get the flat 950 R&D in terms of what it means for the fourth quarter?","Patrick Allen","Well we are expecting a pretty significant ramp up in our commercial systems fourth quarter both as a result of that we actually have an extra week in the fourth quarter so that\u2019s an abnormality plus fourth quarter tends to be a typically higher spend on R&D as we try to complete some projects for the year. We also have budgeted an increase in government systems R&D and again is tied to that extra week in the quarter as well as the seasonality. So, yes you\u2019re looking at about, in order to get to 950 you\u2019re looking at about $35 million step up in R&D quarter-to-quarter which sounds really high but when you factor in the extra week it\u2019s more a seasonally adjusted norm.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Got it. So, how come we don\u2019t get it on the sales line?","Patrick Allen","Well you\u2019re going to see a very good quarter from a sales perspective as well.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Hello?","Kelly Ortberg","Hi George.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Hi. My question is I want to pour a little bit more into the commercial margin. So Patrick, if incentive comp was kind of at the 100% rate I assume if over-rolled that was maybe $3 million higher this year than last year I want to know if that was correct. And then two total R&D was down by 12 million as you said it I missed it. How much of that was the decline in R&D for commercial?","Patrick Allen","You are absolutely spot on with respect to the incentive compensation was $3 million quarter-over-quarter as a headwind. And then commercial systems R&D quarter-over-quarter is down roughly on a company funded basis about 6 million.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. The ARINC margin of 13% implies a sequential decline in the fourth quarter. So you just go into what might be happening there?","Patrick Allen","Well, remember what we talked about this quarter is we had a very good mix of sales, very strong sales in the business and transport aviation network business. And more lumpiness and lower sales in what tends to be lower margin security and airports business. That mix is going to moderate a little bit going into fourth quarter and so we expect the margins to drift down just about. The other thing I'd say is that I think we had a bit of accumulative catch-up on our amortization in the third quarter as well that might have driven a couple of million dollars of additional profit for the ARINC business.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Very good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Could you guys just go a little further into the retrofit decline piece of the aftermarket that you cited? And just a little more detail on what you actually saw and what you're expecting from that business on more than just a one quarter of basis going forward?","Kelly Ortberg","","Well as we said the retrofits are tend to be kind of lumpy. The big impact is we had a pretty significant head of display modification that we did last year that didn't repeat this year. So that drove some of the lumpiness.","Patrick Allen","What was it up year-over-year excluding that piece?","Kelly Ortberg","","What sequentially we have -- ","Patrick Allen","","Well let me talk sequentially from Q2 to Q3 we saw a sequential growth in the after market of roughly about 3%. In the fourth quarter we're seeing sequential growth of about 8% and you compare that to a year-over-year change in the after market is fairly about 2%. So I think of six points of that being unfavorable comparables.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","I see, okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask you on the CSeries program, how concerned or not are you given the grounding of the flight test vehicles there and anything you can say about what it means for your long-term commercial growth forecast if there were to be another slide in the program there?","Kelly Ortberg","","Well we expect this issue to be resolved I think they are in the process of working through, they know what the issue is, it\u2019s clearly not a show stopping issue, they will get that result. It will have some impact if the schedule slips and I think there is high risk that could happen. If the schedule slips in '15, could have probably a point of impact to our overall commercial business.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you. And Patrick could you give the Datapath peak to trough or what their ongoing revenue number is now and if you have what it was at the peak handy?","Patrick Allen","So it was roughly a $100 million this year. And I think the peak was probably about $270 million.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Just forget to put the cart in front of the horse, so the guidance conserve in early September before your next call. So just Kelly you have kind of (inaudible) if it's not resolved and probably won't be before September and a couple of point headwind in defense, R&D tax credit might probably would not resolve and maybe you build in some conservative among the CSeries. As we think about the those three things or others can you quantify those, as it applies to the businesses or puts and takes to those? And maybe Patrick what it would be the tax rate we should use pre R&D tax credit?","Kelly Ortberg","Well Myles, we're in the process of putting together our annual plan right now. So, I'll provide those details when we provide guidance. As I look our government business, we set an objective to get to flat in \u201815, couple of points of that flat in \u201815 will be around the JTRS Manpack decision. So, we'll just have to see the relative timing. I don't see anything underlying in the end market that gives me great concern on the growth objectives that we've laid out there.","Yes, we've got program timing, we've always had program timing with new entries and that's something that we just have to deal with. As I said CSeries probably a point atmost for impact in the next year and we've got upside opportunities as well with lot more. One of the things that we're finding is we're as we're trying to lean off our expenditure in deferred engineering that customers are funding us a little bit more for non-recurring engineering so that would be an upside that will help offset some of those headwinds that we're dealing with.","Patrick Allen","And as it relates to the R&D tax credit Myles, on an annual basis, I think we've seen on annual basis last few years. But on annual basis it provides about 200 basis point reduction in our tax rate. As you know that's pretty unpredictable and occasionally it will come with a retroactive restatement. But suffices to say I don\u2019t expect that to be resolved by the time we issued guidance and so our guidance will exclude that impact.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then one clarification Patrick I think you said 50 million was your pre-production amortization for next year?","Patrick Allen","Yes.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Because that's 11 million or so wider than what was in the last Q have you built in further slippage in CSeries and others into that forecast.","Patrick Allen","I think we've built in further slippage on some both commercial and government programs, yes.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay thanks.","Operator","","Next question is from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","","Hi, great thank you. Just one first quick follow up to Myles. Can you give us a sense of what the JKRS revenues are this year just we know what the base line is?","Patrick Allen","I believe it's right around $100 million this year.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","","Got it. And in terms of pre-production engineering what is it looking for 2015 at this point?","Patrick Allen","","Pre-production engineering. I don't want to get into that level of detail at this point because, I haven\u2019t even seen the plan from our commercial systems, our government systems business. I know we anticipated it coming down. If I was to guess right now coming down in the order of about $50 million year-over-year but again I haven't seen the plans yet.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","","Got it. And then just one more on the OE side and biz jet you are running about flat in the June quarter a little bit down for the last three quarters in composite, kind of you mentioned the moving pieces any reason to think that the trajectory changes meaningfully either for better or for worse as you look at over the next few quarters and into 2015?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, we\u2019re expecting a fairly significant increase in business jet, well I\u2019ll call BRS business and regional in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. And that\u2019s driven by I think some spares deliveries and could be some early shipments on the Embraer program.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","And then in terms of the OE side, any major changes the trajectory as you look out not just in the fourth quarter, quarter-to-quarter seems to be a bit lumpy but as you look out to next year or right now just a flattish type business?","Kelly Ortberg","Well what we\u2019ve said as we think that the overall market is going to be flattish and that there will be growth and it will come through that new aircraft entries into the marketplace. So, we\u2019ve got the legacy 500 that will as I mentioned will provide an uplift to growth and if you\u2019re looking at this on year-on-year comparables remember that last year we had a pretty significant rate reductions at Cessna and now we\u2019re kind of sitting in a more stable environment albeit at low production rate environment going forward.","Patrick Allen","And let me just clarify the fourth quarter growth we are going to see growth in the business in regional side in excess of 10% year-over-year and it\u2019s going to be driven some by product deliveries but also by non-recurring engineering some of this customer funding that we\u2019ve talked about earlier. ","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Got it, great. Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Hey, good morning everyone. Kelly, just a quick follow-up to jitters. I wonder if you wouldn't mind just spending a few minutes and provide a bit of a teaching on where we are and with that program from the customers perspective. What their requirements are at this point, how they are fulfilling those requirements today if they're not taking deliveries at jitter radios and what that requirements can be as we move out toward the end of the decade and why you are so confident that we're going to see this program in shifting more units as we move out into the fiscal '16?","Kelly Ortberg","So there is really no issue with the requirement here there is strong demand for the radio, it's a major part of providing the network capability to the soldiers. So we're not seeing a weakening demand, the challenge we have is we're currently in low rated initial production and the programs acquisition strategy requires that they move from low rated initial production to full and open competition for full rate production, okay. And today the two, low rated initial production contracts are with Rockwell Collins and General Dynamics.","So they've been struggling with how they now go open the market to full rate production and the production program has been slipping. So what has happened is this year, they've bought another lot of LRIP radio, so they can continue to deliver the radios to the warfighters that they need. And so the issue and we're in a production break right now, we're just starting backup, because we saw the break between our LRIP lots is they are struggling with the timing. So this is much more of an acquisition challenge than it is a challenge in the long-term for the demand of the radios.","Now we do go to full and open competition for full rate production. So that will be an important milestone their current acquisition strategy is that they are going to select to suppliers for sustained production lots for that overall program. And we are not really seeing any softening in the overall quantity requirements for the Manpack radios in any of the budget activities that are going on.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Okay. When does the competition occur?","Kelly Ortberg","","Well, next year they are working on the draft request for proposal activity right now, but I would expect that there would be no deliveries under the full and open full rate production until fiscal year '16. And therein lies the challenge because we are going to deliver out our LRIP lot that we\u2019re currently under contract for pretty early in fiscal year \u201815 and without another bridge we\u2019ll have to shut the production line down and wait for the competition for a full rate.","Jason Gursky - Citi","And do you expect more than just the two competitors for this competition.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","","Next question is from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Kelly I was hoping you could just update us on your bigger picture thoughts on M&A as part of the strategy from here, we\u2019ve all talked in the past about our return to buyback but clearly the ARINC transaction has been success so far, I was just wondering has it made you maybe a bit more interested in acquisition driven growth going forward and what does that pipeline look like?","Kelly Ortberg","","Well, we have said that this is a new growth platform for us. So I don\u2019t know if I would say more interested I think we made the acquisition knowing that we wanted to create a growth platform and that opens opportunities for us to add to our portfolio. I would love to see some additional opportunities where we can supplement the synergies between what was the ARINC business and what was the Rockwell Collins business going forward.","We're sorting through that, our first priority was to get our feet on the ground with the integration and get that work behind us. I think what you are going to see are more opportunities are smaller in nature, I don't think you are going to see them large segments, companies that provide applications and services that again can compliment, more like what you've seen from us prior to the ARINC acquisition.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it. So, bolt on perhaps going forward, but is it fair to say that something of the scale of ARINC just isn't out there, that's more of a one off?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, they very much come, when they come, we can't control that. I think for us, if you look at our overall capital strategy that's probably not something that we are going to take on in the next year or so as we're dealing with our short term debt.","But if an opportunity represents itself that it as good as ARINC, we'll certainly take a look at that, I'm not opposed to that.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to dig into a little bit more into some of the metrics around taking Datapath out of earnings, understanding the guidance. So, Patrick wouldn't that add $0.05 or $0.06 on it's own just taking that out the full year?","Patrick Allen","Well, you got to consider a couple of things, first of all, about half of it is related to loss on the sale. So that was not contemplated in any original guidance. And the other thing is on a seasonal basis, Datapath always has a very strong fourth quarter and it was going to be about a breakeven business for us.","Now that we're selling it hopefully soon, we won't keep the benefit of all of that fourth quarter surge, but we were certainly anticipating that in our original guidance.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","So the loss on sale what you already factored that into your discontinued ops earnings before?","Kelly Ortberg","","Yes. That's in our -- that's the bulk of our loss for this quarter is the loss on sale.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Okay. And what are the proceeds?","Patrick Allen","","That\u2019s about $10 million.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Okay. So you must have written off a big chunk before because, you paid obviously quite a bit more than that five years ago. So why wasn\u2019t the loss a lot bigger?","Kelly Ortberg","","Yes, we paid $125 million for it. And there is a couple of things. First of all, we generated quite a bit of cash over that period of time when Datapath was generating north of 200 million of sales. So we did were able to work that down but also the way you allocate goodwill is allocated to a reporting segment. And so that sort of gets peanut buttered across the Government System segment. So it doesn't, you don't have to write off the entire amount of the goodwill associated with the acquisition.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good morning guys. Just kind of following up may be on Joe's question about the outlook. I would have thought, maybe I am wrong here with the change in the intangible asset amortization expense that you would have raised the high end of your guidance by at least a little bit to -- for that may be I am wrong but can you give me some more color on that Patrick?","Patrick Allen","Well what we did was tightened the guidance range and effectively raised the mid-point. But as we looked at it, we thought that the high end was a pretty reasonable place to be. And what we typically do over the course of the year is narrow that range, so obviously raising the high-end wouldn't have accomplished that objective. So what we do is look at our current forecast and tighten the range around that forecast. So, the forecast rose as a result of the amortization change but the high-end didn\u2019t.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Patrick, just a follow-up on the (inaudible) program, how should we be thinking about margin implications if you guys do have to shut that line and the overhead absorption issues, I mean is it should we be thinking about government margins being down early in \u201815 or maybe if you could just give some color around the margin implications to that program?","Patrick Allen","Obviously, anytime you lose sales, it creates -- marks challenge for you. Fortunately it\u2019s not a huge amount of our sales volume, it\u2019s what about 2% of government systems total sales, even actually little bit less than 2%. So nothing that\u2019s going to create a huge absorption issue. And actually I think we do have some deliveries of the second lot of LRIP in \u201915, early \u201915. And so if there is any margin implication, it would likely be toward the back half of the year. And as you\u2019ve seen in the past, we generally do a pretty good job of managing our cost structure to the current volume. So, if there is not LRIP 3, we\u2019ll manage that cost down.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Perfect. And then just lastly, can you give us any color on the current booking trends from the government business on your shorter cycle; I mean are you seeing contracts start to flow again or any additional color you can provide there?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, we are. I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty stable since we\u2019ve got through the Ryan-Murry Act and the budgets, long-term budgets got better visibility. So I think we\u2019re to a more normal contracting activity associated with our defense business. Now that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fast, I'd say it's more normal, working things like the KC-10, acquisition strategy is taking a little bit of time. We originally had some of that revenue in fiscal year '14. It\u2019s now pretty much pushed because of those delays. But I'd say that's more normal, it's not because of uncertainty around the budget.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it. Perfect, that's helpful guys. Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay.","Operator","Next question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","Hi, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Ken.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","Patrick or Kelly, just a follow-up on the commercial transport aftermarket flat year-over-year. Can you provide a little more detail on, I know discretionary is probably doing better and the MRO a little soft, but how good is discretionary doing and specifically how strong was IT this quarter and mandates relative to the MRO side?","Patrick Allen","I think as you mentioned, transport was pretty flat. And I don't think we saw a much growth in either the discretionary or the non-discretionary piece, both were pretty flat for the quarter. There was a little bit of sequential growth and we're anticipating even a higher level of sequential growth next quarter in the air transport market.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","Okay, okay. So you didn't see much specifically from any initial provisioning in this quarter?","Patrick Allen","Nothing, certainly nothing year-over-year that would have generated growth.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","And would you expect assuming a 350 stays on track that\u2019s something picks up next year or is that more of 2016 story?","Patrick Allen","It's more of a next year story.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, we're actually hopeful that we get a little bit of initial provisioning for \u201815. even in the end of this year, we're going to be right on the fiscal year edge, but it certainly will drive some growth throughout fiscal year '15.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","","Ryan Miller","","Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","The last question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Yes. Patrick, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit because I noticed that you said medical was higher this quarter but you also said it was higher last quarter, so I mean is this going to be an ongoing trend? And then how much higher roughly was it? I mean we got to be talking maybe $5 million or more higher than what it was last year?","Patrick Allen","","Yes, I think your order of magnitude, you are right; it\u2019s roughly $5 million. And yes, we\u2019ve had adverse trend this year. We are hoping that that\u2019s phenomenon that won\u2019t recur. We\u2019re small enough population that a few large claims can swing the number pretty significantly and that\u2019s what we are seeing this. So again hopefully we\u2019ll return progress to the mean over time here but certainly the last couple of quarters have been tough.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Okay. But because even if you put all that together, the incremental still weren\u2019t as great this quarter, do we start to see them look better in the subsequent quarter, so mix had a lot to do with it this quarter as well?","Patrick Allen","","I think mix was after considering the IPP and the medical, the other story was mix. We had a large portion of our growth was associated with this customer front in engineering which comes -- some of it comes at no margin, some of it comes at a fairly low margin.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Okay. Thanks again.","Operator","","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan Miller","","Alright, thank you Mike. We\u2019re going to file our 10-Q later today, so please review that document for additional disclosures.

For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on the website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning everyone. Well, it's quite obvious that all eyes are on the commercial aftermarket. And unfortunately, as you've seen in our press release, we too have some soft aftermarket results for the quarter, which I'm going to detail in a moment.","But before I do that, I think it's important to put this in this context. With three quarters down, we are narrowing our range of results all consistent with or better than previous guidance ranges. Our execution performance has been excellent in all quarters for this fiscal year.","And I was especially pleased with our operating margin performance this quarter in spite of the aftermarket softness. We were able to flow solid incremental margins in both Commercial Systems and Information Management Services. And our focus on improved cash conversion is paying off, as we improved our cash flow from operating activities by 29% for the first nine months of the year over the same period last year.","So with that as context, what I'd like to do is walk through each of our businesses and give you my assessment of the market conditions and how we're doing. And let me start off with our Commercial Systems business. Our OEM revenues continue to be strong in the quarter, growing 10%. And year-to-date, we're exceeding our expectations on Commercial Systems OEM sales, where we've had better than expected buyer-furnished equipment mix in air transport as a result of high airline capture rates.","In our business and regional OEM, we've been successful in obtaining customer funding, which has generated increased customer-funded development sales on many international programs. In this quarter, we announced that Cessna has selected our new Fusion EDS product line for their King Air fleet. This product line is ideally suited to allow us to compete, and win, in the light segment of the market, a big strategic move for us.","On the flip side, the commercial aftermarket has not lived up to our expectations this year, and we're seeing a couple dynamics play out here. First, in business and regional systems, business jet flight hours are just not growing. We came into the year expecting that flight activity would continue to recover at last year's rate and unfortunately, it just hasn't. This past quarter, the activity was relatively flat. Interesting, we are seeing relatively reasonable flight activity grow in the newer jets, but really weak utilization in the older models.","In addition, the discretionary side of our BRS aftermarket continues to be soft and underperform our expectations. One bright spot has been cabin updates, but the flight deck updates are just still not picking up. As we enter the year, we thought discretionary spending in the business jet aftermarket was ready to rebound, and it was showing some signs of early recovery. I also thought that lower oil prices would help accelerate the recovery in the second half. And as it's turned out, we just aren't seeing anything tangible in the marketplace that would indicate that the bizjet aftermarket is ready to make a run.","Also for the third quarter, our air transport aftermarket business was down about 4%, due primarily to lower entry into service spares for the 787. Now this surprised us a little bit, but we do know why it's happening, and it's not all bad news here. We knew going into the quarter that there weren't a lot of new airlines taking 787 aircraft, but we did expect some additional spare sales that didn't materialize. The reason they didn't is that airlines are now recognizing that they don't need as many spares as first estimated supporting their aircraft. And why is that, well, it's because our products are performing very well in service, and are exceeding even our reliability expectations.","So when you combine the higher actual reliability of the products with the fact that most of the airlines have already provisions for spares using a lower predicted reliability, we realized a fairly meaningful reduction in 787 spares during the quarter. Now aside from 787, we also had a few timing issues with Intertrade used parts sales that slipped from the third to the fourth quarter.","Now if you look at our underlying MRO and exclude the impact of the items I just talked about, our air transport aftermarket's MRO sales were actually up mid single digit year-on-year, which is more in line with the market fundamentals.","So, based on our aftermarket performance to-date, there's no doubt we'll fall short of our high single digit guidance we set beginning of the year. I'd now expect our aftermarket sales for the year to grow more in the low single digit range when all is said and done.","So let me back up and look at our Commercial Systems revenues. We're better than expectations in OEM, worse in aftermarket, and about on overall. And we've done a really good job of managing the mix shift as the OEM customer-funded development sales come at relatively very low margins. I should add we're also expecting the impact of the Bombardier rate reduction on the Globals to primarily impact us next year, and not be a significant impact to our fourth quarter.","Now on to Government Systems, where things have been much more stable. The only real shift has been the impact to foreign currency. As we've talked about in the past, this is our business that has the most exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and we've sized that as about $40 million of headwind for the year.","The good news is that we're expecting to offset this headwind and still achieve our revenue guidance of about flat for fiscal year 2015. This has been accomplished through modest improvements in our legacy hardware sales, and a significant increase in development program sales, primarily in the data link area and modernized GPS programs.","Our Government Systems operating performance has been very strong, and I still expect full-year margins of about 21%, while accommodating higher spending in both R&D and B&P as the market recovers. So our government business continues to execute our strategy to return to growth, and I'll add that bookings for the year are on track to our plan.","Now let me turn to Information Management Services. In the third quarter, we had solid growth of about 8% in aviation-related services, which again represents about two-thirds of our IMS sales. During the quarter, we did have some modest headwinds in the non-aviation part of the business, primarily related to the wind-down of a government public safety program we've talked about in the past. Overall, we remain on track with our revenue synergy plans and the integration of ARINC has gone very well.","If you remember, early on the revenue synergies were going to come primarily from the business jet service consolidation, as we leveraged our strengths of Rockwell Collins' legacy international flight support services group with ARINC Direct. This is going really well and in fact is even offsetting some of the bizjet utilization headwinds I discussed earlier.","To give you a sense of that, year-to-date, we're seeing a 10% reduction in the number of international trips being flown, yet our revenues in this area are up 8%. The reduced flights are primarily in and out of China, Russia and the Middle East due to the dynamics in those regions. And again, we're executing our IMS business very well, and we surpassed 15% operating margins for the quarter as we continue to see good leverage on the aviation services growth.","So if you bring this all back together for the enterprise, the quarter was headlined by 12% EPS growth, a strong operating margin and cash flow performance and our development teams continue to perform at a high level as we progress on a number of new aircraft loaded with Rockwell Collins equipment that will enter service over the next five years. And we continue to make progress in positioning for growth over the long term and with that growth, our plans have delivered double digit earnings and cash flow.","So with that, let me turn it over to Pat and have him walk through the details of the financials for the quarter.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of 2015. I'll begin on slide 3 where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.","Total company sales for the quarter increased $29 million or 2% compared to third quarter 2014 sales. Income from continuing operations improved $15 million or 9% over the prior year. Now the income from continuing operations improved primarily due to the higher sales and a benefit from favorable adjustments related to the remeasurement of certain prior-year tax positions.","Now as a reminder, in our last earning's call, I said that we expected the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the third quarter rate due to some tax planning items we were working. As you can see from the current quarter, we were able to finalize those items a little earlier than we expected and most of the benefit we had anticipated for the fourth quarter has now been recognized in the third quarter. We were also able to recognize the benefit on the more favorable into the range, and as a result, I now expect the effective tax rate to be about 28% during the fiscal year, previously guided in the range of 28% to 29%.","Earnings per share increased $0.14 or 12% compared to the third quarter of 2014, and earnings per share grew in excess of income from continuing operations due to the ongoing favorable effect of our share repurchase program.","As we turn to slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $611 million for the quarter, up 5% from the third quarter of 2014. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $35 million or 10% to $373 million primarily due to higher customer-funded development program sales and an improved share of airline selectable equipment, higher deliveries in support of the A350 and Legacy 500 entries into service and higher hardware sales for Chinese regional aircraft. Aftermarket sales decreased $3 million or 1% to $225 million due to lower spares provisioning for the Boeing 787 program partially offset by higher regulatory mandate sales.","Commercial Systems operating earnings increased 8% to $141 million in the third quarter of 2015, with the operating margins expanding 80 basis points from 22.3% to 23.1%. The increase in operating earnings and operating margin was due to the higher sales and a favorable contract adjustment.","Moving on to slide 5, Government Systems revenue decreased by 1% to $530 million in the third quarter and included a year-over-year currency headwind of $12 million or 2% of sales. Looking at our product categories, sales of avionics increased $11 million or 3% from higher hardware deliveries for rotary wing aircraft and higher KC-10 retrofit sales partially offset by lower simulation and training sales.","Communication product sales were flat as higher data link development program sales were offset by lower deliveries of JTRS Manpack radios. Surface solutions sales decreased $25 million or 37% due to lower deliveries of FireStorm targeting systems and lower development sales for the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System program. Finally, Navigation product sales increased $9 million or 21% due to the development effort on modernized GPS products.","Government Systems third quarter operating earnings decreased $4 million to $108 million resulting in an operating margin of 20.4% compared to 20.9% in the third quarter last year. The lower operating earnings were due to lower sales, higher investment in company-funded research and development, and bid and proposal costs.","Turning to slide 6, IMS achieved revenue of $152 million, up 4% from $146 million in the third quarter of 2014. The aviation connectivity related sales increased 8% over the prior year due to continued growth in GLOBALink and ARINCDirect. As I've mentioned in the past, the non-aviation sales can be lumpy from quarter to quarter, and we were negatively impacted in the quarter by the end of a government program.","IMS operating earnings increased 10% to $23 million in the third quarter of 2015, with operating margins expanding 70 basis points from 14.4% to 15.1%. The increased operating earnings were due to higher sales volume and the absence of certain licensing costs incurred in the prior year, partially offset by higher business development costs.","Now turning next to slide 7, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $341 million of operating cash flow compared to $265 million last year. The improved cash generation resulted primarily from higher earnings and lower tax payments.","Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment through the third quarter of the year. During the first nine months of the year, total spend increased 7% to $731 million. Company-funded R&D increased $7 million due primarily to positioning our Government Systems business for new growth opportunities.","Customer-funded R&D increased $74 million due to higher international development programs in Commercial Systems, higher data link development programs in Government Systems, and higher amortization of pre-production engineering costs. Pre-production engineering investment net decreased due primarily to lower spending on the A350 program and higher amortization expense. Looking to the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $1 billion in total R&D.","Moving to slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of the last year. At the end of the third quarter, we had debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 1.9. I expect it to come down over the remainder of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is typically generated in the fourth quarter and as we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of third quarter is detailed on slide 10. During the quarter, we repurchased about 920,000 shares at an average cost of $96.06. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $380 million.","Now on to slide 11, where I provide the details of our fiscal year 2015 financial guidance, which has been updated from the guidance we provided last quarter to reflect the narrowing of the previously guided ranges. Sales are expected to be in the range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. Our outlook for operating cash flow is in the range of $725 million to $775 million and total R&D investment and capital expenditures are unchanged at about $1 billion and $200 million respectively.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Kelly, on this whole provisioning issue, how much visibility do you have on this, maybe just looking very short term into Q4? And then maybe how is this going to pan out next year?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me give you a little bit more color on that, because as I said in the prepared remarks, it's not all bad news. Our equipment is performing really well, particularly our displays on the aircraft and that's good for Rockwell Collins, good for our brand. I can't wait to use that data to help go sell those displays on retrofit to 767, 757 retrofit programs. So net-net, I think that's going to be good.","And remember that all this equipment is under warranty and the better it performs, the better our warranty performance is going to be. What we're doing right now is resetting at the actual reliability versus the predicted reliability, and we kind of incorporated that in the full year expectations that I outlined.","So I think we've got pretty good visibility. In fact, most of the orders we missed or sales we missed for the year, we actually got a sale from several of the customers. It just was for much fewer items than what they were originally planning and what we anticipated. So to me, this is something we'll reset. We're going through our annual plan right now for fiscal 2016, and I think we'll be able to size this pretty well. It's all based on factual data and the fact is we know what's going on, so we'll be able to predict it going forward.","There's no question it will lower the demand appropriately for the higher reliability sparing equipment. So a company like say Boeing, on a GoldCare program, they've provisioned. They bought a lot of spares from us. They're going to be able to support more aircraft with the number of spares than we originally had anticipated.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Happy Friday.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carter.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Kelly, just want to kind of ask a question about sort of trend lines here. As we exit the year, obviously a couple things finishing out this fiscal year a bit different than the plan on the OE front, on the discretionary aftermarket front. I know you don't guide until September, but when you think about the impact on those things for next year, are any of those OE sales a pull-forward? Do you think any of that discretionary aftermarket absence moves into next year? And when you look at the non-aviation portion of IMS, is there anything particularly tough or easy about the compares there given the lumpiness in that business? Any color there would be really helpful.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you're right in that we're not giving out 2016 guidance here today. We're working our plan, as I said, right now in that. I think air transport is pretty solid. The things we're having to analyze is looking in the aftermarket results, in particularly in the business and regional, they're not as we expected. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the relatively newer airplanes are being flown. The older airplanes in fact had some declining utilization this past quarter. That's not good news, because those are the airplanes that are targeted for the mods and updates. So we're factoring that into the market going forward. Obviously, we have the Global headwind going into next year. And Patrick, in previous forums, has outlined the impact of the Globals, the C Series, and the Lear 85 on our commercial growth. And recognize that we're not going to see year-on-year non-recurring engineering sales growth at the rate we saw this year. So next year, the OEM growth rate is clearly going to be challenged in our business and regional market.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Sam.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I actually wanted to follow up on that last comment. And I know you have highlighted the 300 or 400 basis point impact from the Bombardier products, and you lumped them all together. I guess I'm wondering, if you had assumed a slower rollout of the Global 7000, 8000 when you were talking about Globals, and if that entry into service is delayed, is that a further headwind or is there not much in terms of ship sets next year?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Sam. The 7000, 8000 really had no impact on next year. So, the timing of that is still something that we have to look at, but should have no impact on us for next year. Clearly, the rates on the 5000, 6000 do.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And Pat, just one thing, can you size that favorable contract adjustment in the Commercial Systems?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It was about $5 million.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Kelly. In fact, can you maybe give us a little more color on \u2013 IMS continues to put up nice growth, 8% in the aviation-related area. How are you doing on kind of the initial revenue synergy targets that you laid out? And it seems like you continue to see good adoption there on the connected aircraft theme. Thanks.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are. The revenue synergies are planned out real well, and I'm very pleased with that. And that's why I made the comment that we're actually offsetting some weakness in utilization or flight activity in some of these regions of instability. So we brought those two businesses together. With fewer flights, what that means is that we're getting more revenue per flight, or we're gaining additional customers, and a little of both of that is happening.","So we're pretty well on track with our plan for $10 million of top-line synergies in this fiscal year. And I feel real comfortable about the continued cadence of synergies going forward. We got a lot of activity going on in that market space. In connectivity, we're working with Inmarsat and their new Global Xpress, with OneWeb, with Iridium NEXT. We've just released our new flight tracking activity, and we're in the trial period of that, not in a revenue-generating period. That'll turn to a revenue-generating activity next year. We've got the infrastructure build-out underway, where we're putting additional radio coverage in some of the areas where we've had weak coverage in the past. So, we're laying the framework for that growth going forward, and I feel pretty good about it.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Kelly, I wanted to turn back to Government Systems for a minute and talk about the implied fourth quarter margin for you to keep on track toward the guidance you gave earlier, and how we should think about that business, and when we might see more of a north-bound inflection.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what we've said was that we would get to flat this year. And as I said in my remarks, that looks like a good plan, and we're going to achieve that. And then we'll start low single digit revenue growth next year. So, I think we're all on track on that. Our bookings are coming in as we expect. Pat, in terms of the, do you want to answer the margins?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I'll talk to the margin. Rob, the margin for the fourth quarter is going to be obviously north of what we've done to-date, about 22.5%, to get us back to our guided margins. And that's not inconsistent with where we've been historically. Typically, our fourth quarter tends to be our highest margin quarter, because it also tends to be one of the highest volume quarters of the year as well. So I'm not concerned too much about that margin.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And thanks, Patrick. Kelly, just a final question on what you said, when does surface solutions eventually bottom? Because it seems like that would be key.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the surface solutions is really, that portfolio is really being impacted by this CRIIS program. It's a range instrumentation program that we're going through the wind-down of that. We're pretty close to bottoming out on the development program. We're getting close to the end. So that will then move to a production phase, not a real large production phase, but we will start to see then some growth coming back out of the CRIIS program. So, I would expect that our two portfolios that are relatively shorter cycle businesses, our surface and navigation portfolios, you're going to start to see those turn. And in fact, you are starting to see the navigation portfolio turn, which was one of the leading decliners when we entered into this segment. And actually, we had good growth this past quarter in navigation.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just maybe a big picture question for you. How are you thinking now looking forward at the M&A environment and how you're going to deploy capital? And does the Sikorsky acquisition, potential acquisition by Lockheed change the M&A environment in the defense world?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't think so. First of all, I don't think it's going to change our business. Sikorsky has been a very important customer to us, so is Lockheed. And that combination hopefully will provide additional business opportunities for us going forward. So, I don't see that as a big shift. In terms of our M&A focus, it hasn't changed. I would like to continue to find areas in both our commercial and government business where we can build out this information management portfolio. You saw that with our Pacific Avionics, a small deal. But more of those kind of bolt-on acquisitions that can help us build out our portfolio and take advantage of this market growth.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I mean, are there other areas that you perceive you might have holes in the portfolio?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's areas across our portfolio where, I wouldn't call it holes, but there's opportunities for us to grow by building out. Electronic warfare is an example where we're relatively a niche player, and if there were opportunities in that segment to build out and leverage our strength and our channels, then those could be good opportunities for us going forward.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey Kelly, I just wanted to go back to your comment about the quality of your product and the fact that it's performing a little bit better than perhaps what you and your customers expected, which as you suggest is a great thing perhaps for everybody. But I'm wondering if it doesn't change the business model a little bit and how you guys are thinking about the long-term opportunity in the aftermarket and whether you need to reassess how you price your product up front. Maybe you just talk a little bit about the annuity stream that you expected over the long tail of sustaining these aircraft. Are things moving around a little bit on us, and do we need as an industry to see a reassessment of pricing up front? Thanks.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well Jason, what I'd say is we do that all the time. The reliability and the performance of our products continually iterate as technology moves and we crank that into our business cases and determine how much is the aftermarket, how much is the OEM, what's the relative return in both of those segments and price the market accordingly. So yeah, this will be an adjustment going forward for us in terms of how we do that. But I would say it's not a dramatic shift. We just happened to, particularly in this displays area, I think you got to recognize we kind of skipped a generation. We didn't do the 777 displays. We didn't do the 737NG displays. So as we're putting these new systems in, we're finding that they're performing. The new technology is really performing well. And we'll just iterate that into our business cases. I don't see that a major shift.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It sounds like the 300 to 400 basis point impact to fiscal 2016 commercial growth that you've cited is specifically Global Express, Learjet and C Series. Is that correct, or does it capture something else? And then if that's correct, what's the change in the net of everything else as you see it today versus how you originally saw it when you first started talking about fiscal 2016?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well first of all, that is correct. I don't think we've ever put out fiscal 2016 guidance. So I'm not going to answer that second question because there's nothing to compare it against. I think if you look, Noah, to our long-term outlook that we provided about 18 months ago, things have changed a little bit, and you could ask yourself, well what's changed. In air transport, we've won the 777X program. There are higher rates in 737 and A320. Rates have come down a little bit on A330 and 747-8. But net-net, I'd say that's good news for long-term outlook for us in air transport.","In BRS, we've seen the Lear 85 pause, the C Series delay and the downtick in rates on the Globals, and that's what we've kind of given you an indication of the impact of that. We've also seen the MRJ delayed and yet to see the entry into service timing on the Global 7000 and the 8000. So there's no question that the BRS market has seen some shift to the right from that. And our IMS is still clicking along just about as we anticipated going forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess where I was going was if I \u2013 it's recognizing you hadn't given a 2016 number specifically. You had the high single digit thought process for the next several years. If I started high single digits for next year, took the 3% to 4% off for what's happened at Bombardier, I'm kind of 4% to 5%, maybe 6%. And then if there's been a little bit more incrementally negative than positive in the rest of the business between what's going on in the business jet world, just tougher comps we're seeing kind of across the space on the large commercial side, I'm just wondering if we should all be honing in on sub 5% for the commercial business next year.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're working our plans right now, Noah, and we'll put that out in September. I think that was a good question, but I'm not going to put out a number right now because we're still working on our annual plan.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on that question with Patrick, with the 300 to 400 basis point impact on commercial next year from Bombardier, that would imply to me that your Bombardier sales are maybe $350 million to","$400 million. Could you validate that? And also, would that make Bombardier your biggest business jet customer?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, without giving specifics in terms of the amount of sales, George, I can confirm with you that Bombardier is definitely our largest bizjet customer. And I think we've said in the past Bombardier, in any given year, is between 5% and 10% of our sales.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, yeah. That's sort of compute to. And then just one quick follow up. Patrick, when you lowered the aftermarket to low single digit from high single digit, is that all just related to 787 provisioning or is there other stuff that you're seeing?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah George, there's a certain like a two-step production in the aftermarket. Probably a couple of months ago now, we talked at a conference and cited bizjet aftermarket weakness being part of the reduction. And then now with the provisioning, that's the second piece. So really, what we're seeing is a weakness in both elements of our aftermarket bizjet and air transport for very different reasons. But those are the two components that get it down to the low single digits.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, maybe you can clarify the amount of your air transport aftermarket that's provisioning versus kind of straight up non-provisioning MRO and spares. And then Patrick, as it relates to the balance sheet, you talked about some deleveraging into the end of the year given the cash generation. This time last year, I wouldn't have expected you to be quite as patient in paying off the short-term debt. Should we expect that patience in paying off the short-term debt to persist through 2016 such that you could you still buy back similar amount of stock?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I don't want to talk specifically about our buyback plans. But I think you're going to see us \u2013 we took a more measured approach towards the debt pay down this year. I think we'll exercise a similar level of discipline going forward. And when you want to talk about the sparing specifically and think about the air transport aftermarket, it's roughly about half of the discretionary piece of the air transport aftermarket.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay and then.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just to be clear, that includes both initial provisioning, as well legacy spares because we continue to sell spares as we deliver 737s and A320s and the like.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And is the contract adjustment that you took in commercial related to the better performance you're seeing on the 787 specifically or is it another contract or customer?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It was actually, it was a positive impact related to a development contract that we're working on.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Not to beat a dead horse, but this 3% to 4% that you've talked about on the impact from Bombardier, is Kelly, is that a firmed up number or is that kind of your best guess at this point? Do you actually know how far Bombardier is going down on Global, on kind of what they're thinking for C Series next year?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's our best guess.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, you're still \u2013 go ahead, sorry.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we've got a pretty good indication on the Globals. The C Series I think is our estimation and we're going to have to see how that program progresses.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, how much does MAX help you next year? Do you actually see any revenue next year from MAX or is it really 2017?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really 2017.","David E.

Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Richard.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I missed a little portion of this call, so if this was asked, I apologize. I wanted to ask you about defense and your latest outlook on the budget. The prevailing view seems to be that we're going to be getting a CR at the end of the year, fiscal year, maybe resolution by end of calendar year. Wanted to know if you're sharing that view. You guys were one of the early proponents that defense had bottomed. Just want to know if you're still maintaining an optimistic outlook for higher spending.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I am. And remember, our outlook included basic sequestration level. And while I think the base budget is going to stay at that level, obviously the OCO funding is going to be higher. And I too believe we'll get a CR that'll get resolved by the end of the first quarter. That seems to be \u2013 they ought to just make that the standard process because that seems to be what we get every year, so. But that's the way I think it's going to play out as well at this point.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Just quickly on FireStorm. And you noted lower deliveries for the targeting system this quarter. You had thought I think that this was going to be a growth area for you. Was fiscal third quarter just a bump in the road? Do you still see this as a solid growth program, and are you still confident in some upgrade opportunities here?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are. But it does tend to go program by program. So we had \u2013 last year we had some real good deliveries that we're not repeating in this quarter. You'll tend to see that be a causal up and down as those programs play out. But in the broad picture, we do see additional FireStorm sales opportunities. We're working primarily in Europe and the Middle East, and then we've got some upgrades of our installed base that we're expecting over the next couple years as well.","Richard T.

Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks so much. So Kelly, could we get an update on some of the government programs, specifically with the budgetary problems in Brazil? Are you seeing any slowdown on the KC-30? What about the KC-46? Boeing just took that write-off. And then on the opportunity side, where are we with JTRS? Maybe tell us a little bit about the impact of the big MIDS contract you won, and any potential you might have on LRSB. Thank you.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me start with the KC-390 down in Brazil. Obviously with the economic situation, that's something we're watching very closely. So far, everything is progressing. I talk with Embraer regularly about them continuing to be funded, and it's a high priority program in spite of some of the overall budget challenges. So, so far so good on the priority there.","On KC-46, the Boeing charge, from my understanding, was around some refueling system issues, nothing to do with any of our equipment. And so I see no impact to that. And remember, we're starting to wind down our development work, and then we'll move to the low-rate initial production. I think the watch area for us is, can they still get to the 18 aircraft plan that they've got in place. And they think so. And so that'll drive revenues as we move to low-rate initial production.","We have seen some movement on JTRS on the Manpack program, the HMS program. It looks like the RFP is going to drop in August of this year, which is good because, as you know, that's been delayed and delayed and delayed. And what that'll mean is probably source selection next year, and then revenues coming the following year for HMS radios. And the plan in that procurement area is to continue with at least two sources going forward. So, that'll be a important area.","The MIDS program, that was an IDIQ-type contract, large contract in terms of total value. But that was in our plan, Cai. That's not anything new. That's \u2013 think of that as our annual buys of MIDS terminals. And those are data link programs that have been very successful, and continue to be successful going forward. As far as LRSB, I really can't comment on that program.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning, everybody.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just wanted to ask another question about the aftermarket, and definitely appreciate all the detail about what's happened this year. When you step back and put it in context, though, it's been a little bit of a struggle to meet the aftermarket guidance in 2013, 2014, and now 2015. And your long-term plan calls for high single digit growth, which kind of \u2013 in excess of traffic or capacity growth. How should we be thinking about your ability to grow the aftermarket in relation to traffic growth?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the air transport is going to continue to track to the traffic growth. And it's going to be lumpy around the provisioning. We're moving away from the initial provisioning phase to more of a run rate on 787. When MAX kicks in, we'll have a big initial provisioning associated with that, because there's new display systems that everybody will have to provision for. 777 is the same. So I think air transport's pretty solid. I think the discretionary side of the bizjet market is where we've really struggled being able to predict the mods and updates, to your point, in the past three years. And I think that's because we've been expecting a little bit better overall market recovery, and we're just not seeing that. So I think that's something we're going to have to take a real hard look at with the 2016 outlook.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.

Good morning.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ken.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Kelly, you called out Intertrade as some sales shifting from the third to the fourth quarter. Are those material? And then, in the bigger picture, do you see that as an opportunity to perhaps offset some of the other structural maybe changes or weakness you're seeing in the aftermarket moving forward? Is that an area you expect to maybe deploy more capital into, to maybe drive a little bit more growth?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have been doing that. If you recall, about a year and a half, maybe two years ago, we started to see this recycling of components. And our Intertrade business has been growing, and we've been doing that. We've been buying aircraft, tearing them down, selling the parts, and are growing associated with that phenomena. I think that's going to continue. So yeah, our Intertrade business is going to be a continued growth component for us. Now, it's not as big as the overall aftermarket. So declines in the overall aftermarket associated with recycling are not going to be completely made up by Intertrade. As far as the quarter, it wasn't overly material. It just kind of piled on to the 787. And it was just a timing issue. We thought we were going to sell some engine parts this quarter. The customer wants them next quarter. So that's just a timing issue for us.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Just, if I could as a follow up. So, is it fair to think of Intertrade as maybe a double digit growth business for you, or can you put some numbers around that?","Patrick E.

Can you guys give us an update where you are on that program, what your expected shipping levels might be? And even as you look into the planning for next year given what you've learned on the 87 provisioning, does maybe a slowdown there become kind of a headwind against maybe what you guys were initially planning?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well the provisioning part, probably not. As I mentioned, the main area where we're seeing the good news is in the display systems and we aren't doing the display systems on the A350. We've never been out of align with Airbus relative to the A350 ramp. We're expecting about 30 ship sets, and we're aligned in shipping to that and we're aligned with their ramp-up forecast next year. By the way, we're not discounting that either. We think that's a reasonable conservative ramp.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning again. I wanted to go back on the initial provisioning which is that my understanding was about half of the sales are power-by-the-hour type of contracts. And so if that's the case in the higher reliability, at what point would you be able to start looking at those types of contracts at a better margin than where you would have assumed at the beginning?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll have to get a little bit further into the warranty period for both the taking a look at the warranty provision and taking a look at those contracts. We're still relatively early in this.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would say, Sam, that the profitability in the power-by-the-hour contract, well we won't really see improvement until we get out of the warranty period because they're generally priced in two tranches, kind of an in-warranty phase and out-of-warranty phase. So to Kelly's point, I think in early in the contract, we'll see some benefit from lower warranty costs, but the real profitability impact will be out-of-the-warranty period.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But is it running better than the reliability you generally used for those contracts?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it is.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Absolutely.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah for example, we're going to be able to support more aircraft with the number of spares we have built and planned as well. So there will be opportunities associated with this.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I just wanted to know in terms of looking at the increase we've seen both in receivables, inventory and I guess the decrease in payables, is any of that some of the aftermarket flow-through? Is there any reason why we saw all those grow or be negative this quarter?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it's actually pretty typical. We generally have a buildup in Qs two and three and then a fairly substantial burn-off in Q4. And we still anticipate that. I wouldn't associate much if any of the growth to the issues we've got in the aftermarket. There may be a little bit of extra inventory we're carrying that we thought we were going to sell, but it's not a significant component.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. I wanted to ask a little bit more about mandates. In the discretionary business, you had aftermarket being a little weaker than anticipated. It sounds like some in the private jet broker or owner\/operator community are saying that there are a handful of larger new mandates coming towards the end of the decade, and folks see that coming down the pipe, and therefore are holding back on discretionary for now. Do you see that or hear that, and how long would that last if that were going on?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are seeing a little of that, Noah, particularly around the data link mandate for business aviation. We're not seeing that in the air transport but in business aviation. And I think that's this phenomenon of the older airplanes that need to be updated. I think there's going to be pent-up demand for getting those mandates done but that's probably more towards the end of our planning period as you look forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So I guess should we be therefore concerned that that can be a depressor to the discretionary business jet aftermarket for a few years until those finally show up?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know. I wouldn't call it a depressor, no. I'd just say that we're not going to see the growth, as much growth out of the mandates going forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then on the mandates you cited as helping you now in the aftermarket, can you just walk us through what those are and how long those last?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There's two major mandates. One is a TCAS change, collision avoidance change and another one is a data link change. And both of those are mandates out of Europe. We also have some ADS-B updates as well as, well, I'm going to call it a mandate but it's probably a soft mandate in China. It's more of a targeted mandate on HUD utilization. And that's driving both HUD retrofits as well as strong selection of head-up displays which are optional on 737s going forward. So the HUDs are going to continue to be an opportunity for us over the planning period. The mandates this year is really good growth of mandates. We're expecting next year to be good and those particular mandates then will start to wane. They'll get fitted out and so our revenues will start to decline in that area.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Just one other quick question, Patrick. Just on the outlook for this year, it's revenue went to the high end of the prior range, margin stays right in the middle, segment EBIT margin right in the middle. But then EPS also stayed in the middle despite revenue having been at the high end and the tax rate help. I would have thought that would have all equated to earnings also going to the high end. What do I make of that? Is there a missing piece in there?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think it's attributed \u2013 a fair amount of it's a rounding. I mean, we're still in the midpoint of the margin range. But when you think about what we've done in terms of substituting a lot of high margin aftermarket revenue for lower margin development revenues, it's probably on the other side of the 21%. And I'd also say that our tax rate as we planned, that wasn't exactly in the middle of the 28% to 29%. So I'd say a lot of moving parts, but suffice it to say, it's still in that range.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I see. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Patrick, the comp accrual for the year, has there been a change in the plan there?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. We're basically right on guidance, and so no change.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the balance sheet, the I think it was like $30 million increase in the accrual for customer incentives. What exactly is that?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a variety of different customers and a lot of it's timing. But we've had several large airline customers get customer incentives, and we haven't seen as many liquidations over the course of this last quarter as we had prior quarters.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And Kelly, the Legacy 450, 500, how is that program going? And I think the 450 is set to come in here pretty soon. Does that help you a fair amount next year? I know it won't offset the Global, but is it a plus?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And everything is going fine, at least from our vantage point, on the flight test program and certification. So I expect that to come in to the market and be a growth item for us next year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for letting me sneak one in here before the bell. Patrick, just a couple. I noticed since you changed the accounting, the impacts aren't that big. But on pension with one quarter to go, obviously the discount rates have moved a good bit here. Should we be thinking there's any pension impact, a materiality for next year? Maybe just give us an update on that. And then secondly, I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but specifically where does the FX headwind come from in terms of specific products or currencies? Any color on that, helpful as well.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. On the pension side, last forecast I saw \u2013 obviously we haven't done our valuation yet \u2013 the last forecast I saw showed very little change in our pension expense. And Carter, you identified why, and that's because we're amortizing it over such a longer period of time. As for as related to FX, we talked about being $40 million, the vast majority of that being Government Systems, and I would say that it's almost entirely due to the euro\/dollar exchange rate and coming out of our European subsidiaries. And although it's spread across all the portfolios, the one where it's most concentrated is actually in the avionics portfolio.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And Kelly, just one last one. The Manpack RFP you mentioned, I thought there was a draft RFP already out there, so if there's an update coming next month, I wondered if do you expect any material change in that request versus what was in the draft or is this just normal sort of procedure?","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, normal sort of procedure. I think we went through a couple drafts. Clearly they're honing in and so I'm not expecting a heck of a lot of change for this. I think they've got the requirements now honed in and the program is ready to move forward.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert Kelly Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shannon. We plan to file our Form 10-Q later today, so please review that document for additional disclosures.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Bonnie. Good morning to all of you on the call. With me this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected due to certain risks and uncertainties, included, but not limited to, those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. As you all may recall, and when we established our 2013 guidance, we made some assumptions that may have been perceived as questionable at the time, like incorporating sequestration in our defense forecast and a lack of recovery for light and business jets in our commercial markets. As I look at what happened through the first half of the year, with only a few exceptions, things played out pretty much as we thought they would. So you can understand why I am pleased to report that for our second quarter in a row, results are on track with our expectations.","Let's review some of the highlights. Once again, our balanced business proved beneficial as the headwinds in defense were partially offset by growth in Commercial Systems. However, through a continued focus on operating efficiency and returning capital to share owners, we delivered a 7% increase in earnings per share and expanded our core operating margins by 100 basis points despite lower revenue. Additionally, our improved inventory performance, along with lower compensation and tax payments, contributed to an increase in operating cash flow of nearly 300%.","I believe these results demonstrate the financial management you've come to expect from Rockwell Collins, even in dynamic market conditions. In fact, looking back over the first half of the year, we were able to either anticipate accurately or, where we did not, compensate for some softness in the market to achieve these results. I think that speaks to our focus on cutting costs early, being watchful of headcount and driving operational efficiency through lean improvements. These actions have delivered early operational benefits that should set us up for even more significant margin improvements in the second half.","Despite the uncertainties related to U.S. defense budgets and low-end business jet market recovery over the balance of the year, I remain confident we've accommodated them in our guidance. And if circumstances go our way, we may even have some opportunity to do a bit better. We still anticipate second half revenue growth to improve compared to first half. However, based on these first half results, we are forecasting a shift of about one point of growth between our 2 segments. We now project Government Systems to be down approximately 9%, while our Commercial Systems growth is expected to be 6%.","So let me describe the market dynamics that are driving those changes. In defense, particularly in the United States, budgetary issues make it extremely difficult to forecast. While we still lack full clarity into the U.S. DoD's outlook, we now have some visibility in the priorities with the President's fiscal year 2014 budget being released. The request did provide some insight into areas that the administration has continued to support, including avionics for tankers, rotary wing fighters and transports. We're also pleased to see JTRS funding for programs that we're involved with come in as expected, along with a continued focus on GPS modernization and a higher quantity of JDAMs than we expected to replenish stocks used in Afghanistan.","As you recall, we originally modeled $120 million in our original guidance last September as a projected impact from sequestration. To date, there have been no material impacts from sequestration in our results, and most importantly, we've experienced no program cancellations. The expected second half sequestration impacts will likely come in areas like service and support, delays in order timing and reductions to short-cycle products. We'll have to wait and see how things play out for the balance of the year, but I still believe we have ample headroom in the $120 million projection to accommodate sequestration impacts that may come our way.","Meanwhile, we've seen a few areas actually strengthen across our military business, specifically in international markets. Surface Solutions have stabilized sooner than we would have thought as the benefits of our portfolio-shaping actions and international growth opportunities are now expected to deliver incremental growth in this portfolio over the remainder of the year. Additionally, we continue to see increased demand for international tanker and transport avionics products and increased scope on those programs. The combination of these conditions support our somewhat improved outlook for Government Systems.","In Commercial Systems, we expect revenue in the second half of the year to grow 8%, led by mid-teen sales growth in the aftermarket, resulting from favorable comparables for spares, increased cockpit and cabin retrofits and initial mandate-related sales. However, as a result of more modest aircraft utilization in the first half across our commercial businesses, we're revising our full year aftermarket guidance down to mid to high single digits, and our total Commercial Systems revenues growth forecasts down one point to 6%. Except for this MRO aftermarket component, our expectations for Commercial Systems remain unchanged.","In air transport, OEM backlogs are still robust. The resulting increase in demand for aircraft production, combined with new aircraft entering into service, makes this the most stable market segment we serve. Similarly, the business and regional OE market is playing out much as we expected, with some growth of larger long-range aircraft and not much happening at the light end.","With the first half of the year behind us, I feel pretty good that we have seen results in line with our expectations during a period of very high uncertainty. Our teams' continued focus on taking swift action to address these things within our control drove improved operating profits and set us up for improvements in the second half of the year. I remain confident we can meet or exceed our full year guidance, which positions us well to exit this year of transition and enjoy expanded opportunities ahead.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of 2013.","I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company's second quarter sales, EPS, net income and shares. Total company sales for the quarter decreased $30 million or 3% compared to last year's sales, while net income remained flat at $161 million. As a result of our continued focus on returning capital to share owners, earnings per share in the quarter increased $0.08 to $1.17, even with the flat net income as a result of a 7% decrease in average diluted shares compared to the second quarter last year.","Net income and earnings per share for both fiscal years included benefit from tax-related items that essentially offset. This quarter, we realized the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit of about $31 million. But after you net out the incremental compensation cost of $12 million after tax, this net benefit is offset by the absence of a favorable tax adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of last year relating to the completion of certain IRS tax audits.","Turning to Slide 4, we have the second quarter results of Commercial Systems, which achieved revenue of $553 million in 2013, up 4% from $533 million in 2012. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $23 million or 8% to $312 million, primarily from increased deliveries for the Boeing 787 and 737 and the Bombardier and Global -- Bombardier Global and Challenger aircraft. Aftermarket sales increased $3 million to $223 million due to higher business jet retrofits, partially offset by lower transport, air transport service and support and the absence of spare sales that occurred last year as aircraft entered into service.","Commercial Systems' operating earnings increased 4% to $117 million in 2013 with operating margins expanding 20 basis points to 21.2%. The increase in operating earnings and margin was primarily due to the higher sales volume. Lower company-funded R&D expense was offset by an increase in compensation costs that resulted from the Federal R&D Tax Credit extension.","Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems revenue decreased by 8% to $578 million in 2013, driven by the completion of development programs, lower fighter jet-related sales and the reduction in GPS product sales. These headwinds were partially offset by increased sales in areas such as network communications and international sales.","Looking specifically at our product categories, sales of Avionics decreased, as expected, $41 million or 11%, driven by headwinds from development program's transition to production, including the E-6, and lower sales for Eurofighter and helmet-mounted displays for fixed wing aircraft. Communication Products declined $2 million or 1%, primarily due to fewer deliveries of satellite communication products, which was mostly offset by increased deliveries of JTRS Manpack radios. Surface Solutions decreased $1 million or 2% as a result of completing multiple development programs, almost entirely offset by increased international sales of FireStorm targeting systems. Finally, sales of Navigation Products declined by $6 million or 12%, resulting from fewer deliveries of our handheld GPS receivers.","Government Systems' second quarter operating earnings decreased $16 million to $112 million, resulting in operating margins of 19.4%. The decrease in operating earnings resulted from lower sales volume, the absence of a favorable warranty adjustment recorded in the prior year and higher employee-incentive compensation costs. These headwinds were partially offset by lower company-funded research and development, as well as the benefit from cost-reduction actions taken over the past year.","Looking next to Page 6, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $179 million of cash compared to $45 million last year. The increased cash generation resulted from lower incentive compensation payments, improved inventory performance and lower tax payments.","Moving to Slide 7.  We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. In addition to $570 million long-term debt, we had $588 million of short-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. The increase in short-term debt came from the issuance of commercial paper to fund share repurchases, as well as the reclassification of long-term debt that is due within the next 12 months.","We ended the quarter with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 51% and debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 1.1. I feel this level of debt still provides us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs, and I expect it to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally results later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment through the second quarter of the year. Total spend remained consistent at 21.2% of sales. Customer and company-funded R&D expense declined as we completed certain development programs. Meanwhile, we increased our investment in preproduction engineering programs, predominantly in the Commercial Systems business, including the Boeing 737 MAX, Bombardier CSeries and Airbus A350.","The updated status of our share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average cost of $59.72 per share, and we have reduced the outstanding share count by 7% compared to the same period last year. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 84 million shares or $4.1 billion return to shareholders through maintaining an active share repurchase program. During the quarter, we announced an increase in our share repurchase authority of $500 million. And as of the end of the quarter, we have $564 million of total authorization remaining. We expect this authorization to fund our repurchases for the rest of 2013 and into 2014.","Now under our final slide, Slide 10, where we provided details of our fiscal year 2013 financial guidance. As Clay outlined before, we are holding our total sales guidance at $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion for the year, but we now expect Commercial Systems to be up 6% and Government Systems to be down 9%. Additionally, we now expect total research and development investment to be at $950 million, with most of the improvement coming in lower preproduction investments.","At the beginning of the year, we've made certain assumptions regarding the successful capture and the approximate schedule of certain preproduction engineering programs. As we have now updated and aligned our investment schedule for these programs, we feel that the spend profile will increase at a slower pace and, therefore, have moved a portion of the capitalized cost forecast out of our fiscal year. That guidance now reflects an expected increase in preproduction R&D for 2013 of about $170 million. All other aspects of our financial guidance remain unchanged.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So, Steve, back to you to kick off the Q&A session","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Bonnie, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on sequestration, and you were one of the only companies to embed this in the guidance, but what I wanted to ask you is given that that outlook is a little better, or allowing for better Government Systems results, and you're offsetting that a little bit on the Commercial side, if sequestration comes to fruition, it's possible that the full effect of it would be compressed into the back end of the government fiscal year, which matches your fiscal year, so might you not still see the full $120 million?","Clayton M. Jones","That is possible. We could see that, Rob. But the reason we -- I only adjusted the Government Systems one point is really because the first half of the year was a little stronger than we would have said. Remember, when we first gave guidance, we thought that the average reduction in Government Systems sales would be about 10% a quarter, and obviously, we've done better than that in the first 2 quarters. The back half of the year was loaded primarily with the sequestration impact that drove that back down as we're seeing lift from international programs and development programs that are actually picking up, such as our Surface Solutions I mentioned earlier. So the adjustment is just because of the first half results, and we still are waiting to see what that back half guidance is. So you are correct. If we see the full $120 million impact, we'll still be on our current guidance. If we see less than that, that's the improvement I alluded to that we possibly could see.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So a quick one. You've said that R&D is down $50 million, but my number's about 3 -- $30 million of that is deferred engineering. How much of the rest is company R&D? And are you still looking -- because that was an offset to incentive comp, are you still looking for $110 million of incentive comp for the year?","Patrick E. Allen","What I would say, Cai, is that about $40 million of the $50 million drop is related to deferred engineering, and the rest is a mix of company and customer funded. And as for incentive compensation, we really haven't changed our targeted payout this quarter because we haven't changed our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But anyhow, to talk a little bit more about the R&D programs, could you sort of update us a little bit on the progress you've been making, whether it's with the MAX or with the 78 and some of the other programs?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, most of them are on pretty much on track. Where the 78 is concerned, obviously, we're pretty much through all the R&D there. We're in the production, and we only expect just a sustaining level as Boeing looks to add any capability there. We're obviously just beginning on the MAX, on the other side of that. So we're just doing some scope and scaling of that. And some of the realignment that Patrick referred to was just -- now that we've gotten them into it and gotten the contract, we've paced that with what the contract is saying versus what our expectation was at the beginning of the year when we did not have yet that contract. So that is beginning to ramp up, and we'll see much more activity over the balance of this year and into next year as we get that going. And then everything else is in, I'll say, a sort of a transitory state of completion. Obviously, a lot of focus right now is on the A350 as we bring that close to first flight, also a focus on the CSeries as we approach the first flight of that aircraft. Both of those will happen, as you know, this summer. And so a lot of activity to get the -- to help them get to the finish line there. And then I guess the other thing that we're involved in that's a big-time effort around here is the completion of Pro Line Fusion EDS. The fusion itself, as you know, has already been certified, and we're working on applications of about 15 platforms there. But we are working toward completing the EDS version, Embedded Display System version of that, which should be certified here within the next year. So all those are going well. And our folks, especially in Commercial Systems where most of this discretionary development is going, are doing just a superb job of managing those R&D programs on cost and schedule.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","If I can, looking at the second half growth forecast for aftermarket, MRO Americas Conference was this week.  It seemed like there was a more -- definitely more cautious tone regarding growth expectations for the back half of the year. The influx of surplus parts really creating some complications. I mean, can you sort of just discuss the puts and takes around your aftermarket growth? I mean, right off the bat here, it feels like it might be a little bit aggressive.","Clayton M. Jones","Yes, Michael. I'm actually glad you asked that question because I'd like to put some light on that, in light of a lot of those reports I read from the conference last week, which I think were all very good. First, let me remind you, maybe every company likes to think, I think we're different relative to the aftermarket compared to many other aerospace companies. Most of the ones, let's say, the big engine companies, which obviously where the big bucks are and many of you follow, make an awful lot of their aftermarket revenue from just MRO. And so as brake fix happens and as warranties run out, that's the big component of theirs. That's only half of our aftermarket. The other half of our aftermarket are spares and retrofits, and retrofits are the ones that make us unique because as electronic products go, we have the opportunity because of the technology movement and the software base of so much of our product, to insert these retrofits over the life of our product and usually at a much faster pace. So when we break it down into, I'll say, the 3 segments there of MRO and then the 2 components of the rest of it spares and retrofit, here's what we're seeing. We are seeing -- we are definitely seeing that cautious tone or that slowdown that you alluded to in MRO. And in fact, the adjustment we made to Commercial Systems this year is specifically related into that. In the first half, we just did not see the traffic volume and the amount of returns to our service centers that we would have expected in a market that typically was going to -- expected to grow 5% in traffic. And that's -- and the reason we didn't see it is it didn't grow 5% in worldwide traffic. It was out about 1 point to 4%. Moreover, the other impact we saw is that the airlines are being far more efficient, and load factors has -- have gone up about 1 to 2 points. And that's another higher utilization of the existing airplanes and a lower overall utilization of time on the airplane. And so as a result of that, we were basically flat in the first half, and we're only expecting very low single-digit growth of MRO in the second half. So our expectations have been diminished, and that's what affected our guidance change. Now let's look at the other side. In that case, we're seeing a lot of benefit in the second half. So on the second half, as we mentioned, you can compute about roughly mid-double-digit growth, around 15% growth, in the aftermarket, all of which is really going to come in spares and retrofits. And if you think about that growth rate, it's really going to come in 3 sections. The first and the largest group, or about half of that growth, is going to come from retrofits and upgrades. And we have a cockpit retrofit that's just about to be certified, where we have a host of orders that we're going to satisfy after that. We have TV product. We have Cabin Venue updates. We have heads-up display programs, all of which are known and in backlog, which is going to be the biggest part of that growth. About 1\/4 of that growth is going to come from the mandates that we've been talking about, mostly in Europe, for data link and collision avoidance. We've got about 1\/3 of that growth already in backlog. We do have to go close the balance of those orders. But we talked to our customers and we know that they want to pre-prepare their fleets as they go into the 2015 mandate time for that initial order slugs. So we have some good visibility there. And then the balance, the last quarter, is really spares flying into a half of better comparability. A year ago, we had a real front-loaded 787 initial spares and almost nothing in the back end. This year, we're going to see that back-end comparability give us some tailwind. So if you combine those 3 things, that's the visibility we have into the aftermarket, and that is the summary reason we feel good about that aftermarket growth in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess it's more for Pat. But if your deferred engineering was going down by, call it, $40 million or so, why are were aren't we seeing the operating cash flow number bumping up?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I certainly think there's opportunity to the operating cash flow number. And I -- what I would say is we're still halfway into the year. We've only generated $180 million to date. But if I was to -- to be honest with you, I do think there's opportunity to cash flow for the balance of the year. And likely, we'll update our guidance in the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the aftermarket, Clay, specifically, 787, have you seen any change in the provisioning patterns you would have expected to see, given that the plane's been down here for 4 months? And also, can you just explain or flesh out exactly what's going on with 787 relative to your revenue growth you're seeing there as compared to your actual production rate? Because I know your production rate isn't growing, but you're obviously still seeing what it looks like to be pretty good revenue growth out of the 87?","Clayton M. Jones","Sure, David. First of all, relative to your first question, we're really seeing no change from the airlines relative to their spares provisioning, because they're still anticipating they're going to get a slug of these airplanes, hopefully, when the -- a certification gets approved that we all hope today, but very soon. And I think Boeing has been very clear that they've got a plan to get those aircraft modified extremely quickly. And when they do, they realized -- they, the airlines, realized they're going to need those spares to operate the aircraft. So there's been really no slowdown at all. And in fact, relative to 787 spares, I think, as we sit here halfway through the year, we have all the orders we expect to get except one chipset. So we're pretty much fully booked for the rest of the year there, so we feel very confident we're going to get that. Relative to what we're seeing, our guys are scary good because we're seeing almost an exact 50-50 split between those airlines that are purchasing spares and those airlines that are selecting our Dispatch 100 or what you all mostly call power by the hour. And even as we are already having conversations going into 2014, that's kind of how we see it next year as well. So I think that's a good model to look at as the 787 begins to ramp up and build out, that we're on track for that 50-50 split. Relative to your question about the revenue rate, we always have to remind ourselves, again, comparably, when we go back to last year, remember, we were at a higher production rate, about 2.5 going to 3 when there was that -- it was last year's glitch, and we were actually reduced to 2 per month. And so the reason you're seeing a year-over-year improvement in revenue for 787 is because we're comparing last year's 2 per month each quarter to this year's 4 per month, even though 4 per month is stagnant. So you're seeing not only an improvement year-over-year, but a little bit of a sequential move because of that dip down last year. We still believe the second half of the year is when we're going to ramp up from our current 4 up to 7. We're anticipating that. We're in discussions right now with Boeing as we synchronize our -- their inventory to our production rates. So I believe we're pretty much on track to be able to see that, either this quarter or next. Just -- and right now, I can't quite call it exactly. But I would say that's on track for the second half, as we've always said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Clay, I was wondering if we could drill down a little bit into the Avionics piece of Government. I hear you on the improvement in the outlook, mostly on Surface, which really played to last year, getting a little better and some things working out there. Avionics, as I'm sure, as I know you expected, that the year-on-year comps outlook are getting worse. And I just -- I was wondering if you could drill down there and give us a better feel for what's ramping down. I know as you've expected, but still, what's going down and where you are on the pieces that are going to be going up, like tanker, et cetera?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. Well, you're right. It's kind of across-the-board thing, Joe. I would say the biggest component that is reducing that year-over-year revenue, as what we talked about, I think, for several quarters now and have been very transparent on, is this transition of production programs -- I'm sorry, of development programs into production and the sort of gap year you always have when you're going through that transition. Typically, what happens is you spend all your money on R&D and then they test the program for about a year and go through all the bureaucracy in the Pentagon to get it approved to go into production, and it's that gap year that creates the downer. And we have 2 programs -- we actually have like 4 programs going through that right now. But the 2 big drivers are: the E-6, which is, by far and away, the biggest part of it, I think we'd even quantify that as about $50 million of deficit this year; and also the E-2 program, where we've got some simulation work that we're doing on it, both on the avionics and the maintenance terminal is also going through that. Those are, by far and away, the larger impacts. Now there are other impacts, too. For example, CH-47, as we're waiting for multiyear authorization, we saw a dip down there because, actually, we delivered ahead on CH-47, and we had to slow down waiting for that. Our JHMCS, the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems that goes into airplanes like Eurofighter are seeing a reduction, because Eurofighter is coming down. I think we referred to that in there as well. The Saudi F-15 program, again, that's a development program, where we have done some predevelopment work for Boeing, and now we're seeing that come down a little bit just as we're kind of approaching, I'll say, the end of that development program and then as we approach production here in a year or so. Those, I believe, are the sort of largest ones that are the downer. Now I think those will convert to tailwind beginning next year as we see E-6, E-2 move from this gap year to development, as we see the Saudi programs go into production. We're still getting good lift from the F-35, and it looks like the numbers of tails there have remained the same in the budget. So we'll still get some helmet systems there. So we do have some opportunities going forward, but we do have -- the biggest issue is getting through this gap year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Leake of BB&T Capital Markets.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Clay, I was wondering if you could help us out on the European mandates, TCAS 7.2 and data link, how we should look at that on a longer-term growth perspective. Is it going to be lumpy? Will it be smooth? Will most of it be sort of in 15-and-out years? Any color would be helpful.","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. Well, first thing, there will be some lumpiness to it because retrofit programs are always lumpy, and it kind of depends on which airlines choose to do which mod in which quarter. Also, there's a business aviation component to that. It's a smaller component, but it's a component nevertheless. What I would say, as we build toward 2015, you'll see the volume ramp up almost deniably. As much as we'd like to get some of these folks thinking ahead of the game, which is what the lift we expect in the half of this year, let's face it, most people wait to study for the test the night before. And I think you're still going to see an accelerating impact of this as we go into '14. And then probably '15, there'll be a flurry of activity as we go toward that mandated date. Now the couple of things we're watching for that also could diminish the opportunity, and these things are typically legendary, as an example, some aircraft will get waivers to the modification because they can choose not to do this in certain instance where they're willing to pay the performance penalty. So for example, some older business jets where it doesn't make any sense to spend the money to do this because their service life is not very long, we'll typically go in for a waiver, and they'll be granted to not have to do it because it's not going to be around that long. The other thing that'll happen -- that could happen is that this relies on the ground equipment to be in place to utilize these onboard units. And if EUROCONTROL doesn't get all of that done in Europe in time, they typically will slip the implementation. And then as we go between now and '15, they'll say, \"Well, we're just kidding about '15. It's really '16 or '17.\" And in that case, it could stretch us out a little bit. So those are the dynamics that we're looking at. But in general, we expect this to be, again, a nice complement to our aftermarket revenue for the next 2 or 3 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi Investment Research.","Unknown Analyst","Stephen [ph] for Jason. Just a question on your biz jet OE and specifically on light biz jets. I know you would talk about being conservative on that, not expecting much improvement at all this year, really, stagnation. But what are your -- what's your commentary on Textron's -- on Textron cutting production rates this year on these lights? And how does that build into your expectations for this year and going forward?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, obviously, we were disappointed in that announcement, but we're not surprised by it. We obviously build ahead to Cessna, and we had seen the volumes declining even before the announcement yesterday because of that component of the supply chain that we're doing. And in fact, even though, directionally, all the business jets are on -- directionally on track to what we would project at the beginning of the year, I'd say there is some tweaking. What we have seen is that we've seen even more weakness than we expected at the light end. I think that's what you saw -- heard yesterday from Textron. But we -- that has been made up for by even better strength at the high end. With the highs and the mids, we're seeing surprising strength at the mid level, especially with the CL300 at Bombardier, and then the Globals have been selling very well. And so if you think about it, our strategy some years ago to more -- be more diversified across the business jets and to capture the Global and put more work into some of the mids, like the 605 and the 300, are serving us extremely well right now. And that's really compensating for this weakness at the low end. We're obviously watching to see what Cessna is going to do now as they align their production rates to the rest of the year. But what I can tell you -- I mean, let's take an absolute worst-case scenario, which, by the way, we don't think is going to happen. And that is if Cessna were to shut down their entire production line for the balance of the year, that would impact us at only about 1 point of growth in Commercial Systems or about 0.5 point of corporate growth. Again, let me reiterate, I don't expect them to do that, but that gives you a sense of the relative impact to our total business. We're well diversified in that area, and more importantly, we're well positioned in the areas of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Congratulations, Clay, on the transition. I wanted to ask specifically about that. So Kelly was named President late last year. The transition will be a little bit less than a year. And I know these things have sort of uncertain timelines, and there's a lot that goes into the evaluation of when it's time or when the right time to make the handoff is. And I wondered if you might speak to how that evaluation went and how you feel the company is positioned, given not only the challenges you've come through over the past couple of years but some of the end-market uncertainties you face, and how, ultimately, you came to the decision that now was the right time?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, Carter, thanks for asking the question. Again, everybody wants to know about palace intrigue and how all these things happen. And now that we know what's going to happen, I can be a little bit more transparent on that. Well, first, I would say that in terms of the process, this has been an extraordinarily well-laid out, well-orchestrated, diligent process that I began with my board over 2 years ago. I knew that it was going to be the time. In my view, a current CEO and our Board of Directors, there's no more important job than they have, that is, to ensure seamless leadership transitions, especially at the top, and so we took that very seriously. I think the process that we went through, I want to give very high compliments to my board for the advice, the counsel and the collaboration that they did with me to go through this process. I would also say we're very fortunate in this company to have a number of candidates that we considered that were experienced, well prepared and could have fit into this role. I think we're very fortunate that Kelly Ortberg as the guy that's going to do it. He's run Commercial businesses, he's run Government business, he won big programs. He's been through some really tough market conditions, and he's performed exemplary through that whole thing. Our customers know him, and he knows our customers. He's been part of the system. I expect a seamless transition. And if there's any reason why, and there's no rule book for how long this should last, the reason we picked this time in July is because Kelly is so darn ready. He's ready to go, and I'm ready to get out of the way and let him do that, but also, I would say, because of my confidence in the position of this company and the way ahead. You obviously never want to leave a job until you feel the task is fairly well in hand, and not only is your successor ready, but the company is in really good shape. And I think both conditions are in play here. I think the work we've done through these very tough market environments, the amount of market share we've won and the business I see ahead of us are going to set this company up for years and years of success and prosperity, regardless to what the market conditions are. And I think Kelly and the team around him here at Rockwell Collins is very well prepared to mine those opportunities and to provide the share owner returns that all of you expect over time. I'm very confident of that. And this allows Kelly to really move into 2014 with the annual operating plan and the guidance in hand that, that will be his own. So I feel really, really good, if not a little bittersweet, I would tell you, about stepping aside now, but I believe it's time.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","My question is in the aftermarket for business jets, you're actually up 8% year-over-year after being down in the first quarter and up sequentially, like 11%. Now is there anything more to read into that about your prior comments, or it just reflects the strengthening in large end and the mid end and the low end doesn't matter as much to you?","Clayton M. Jones","I think, if you look at just that Q1, Q2, we had a little spares headwind in Q1 and then got a lot of retrofit growth that kicked in in Q2. Remember, it's always a little lumpy, as I mentioned. But there's another dynamic that I think I would point to that, again, gives us confidence for some of the strength in the aftermarket. And that is, typically in periods where we don't see a real rebound or robust OEM recovery, we do usually see good aftermarket and retrofit uptick. And it's a little bit like your house again. If you're not going to sell your house and move into that new house, you're going to maintain and upgrade and keep your current house as comfortable as you can. And the same thing goes for these older aircraft that are not being replaced, driving the upturn in the OE rate. We're seeing them come in and use some of these efficiency improvements and safety improvements that we're now offering. And fortunately, we have a number of those that we've transitioned from our OE development programs that we've used to win share into a retrofit program now that can be used to improve the maintenance, lower the cost of operation of the existing business jets. So there's a macro dynamic help in this, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Actually, I have a quick follow-up on the preproduction engineering investment. Is the reduction there tied to one specific program, or is it several programs? And then, is this a shift of spending for next year? And if so, how should we see preproduction spending the balance going up or moving next year?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. Well, I would say it is several programs, probably most notably, the 737 MAX. And we had just projected a slightly earlier start than we experienced. And yes, I think it is -- you can characterize it as a shift of spending from this year into next year. And so what I've been saying is that our peak year of addition to the deferred engineering balance was going to be this year. I still think that's true, but I think it's going to be -- I think FY '13 or '14, it'd be much closer to flat than I would've previously indicated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask with regard to the government segment and sort of the timing of sequestration. Does the timing of the delay between authority and outlays make sequestration have more of a calendar '14 than calendar '13 impact on the industry in general? And then given your fiscal year end is September, does sequestration have a greater impact on your '14 than what we're seeing in '13? How do you think about that?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, first thing, Noah, I would say that we're all waiting to answer that question. We're a bit as curious as you are because it is -- that's part of the residual uncertainty that we're all not aware of. Here we are sitting pretty close to the end of April, sequestration has been known in effect here for over a month. And while we're beginning to see some early indications of reductions that are coming through those areas I talked about, service and support, we're seeing some of those contracts be either diminished or reduced. We're seeing some -- fewer flight hours affect some of our PBL contracts. We're seeing delays in some time and material repairs we would've done. We think some obligation of funds for certain new programs are being delayed. So we're beginning to see it now, but it's hard to say what the full manifestation of it is because we don't have the master playbook that DoD is going by. So I would say that's why we're being a bit cautious about the balance of this year, and I think it would be premature, until we see that right now, to really see what the effect is going to be next year. But again, I think if there's anything we can say that we feel good about in the midst of all that uncertainty is I still feel very confident we've accommodated it in these numbers. So of all the things you all have to worry about, I hope you're not worried about Rockwell Collins getting worse because of sequestration. My guess is that's on your mind in a few other places, but hopefully not here. But we'll -- it's not a satisfying answer to you, Noah, but I don't have a good answer to exactly how it's going to play out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Imperial Capital.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to, Clay, dig a little deeper into the Commercial aftermarket, on the MRO side in particular. Can you talk geographically if you're seeing, surprisingly, any areas of weakness or strength in the quarter relative to what you were expecting? And as you look out for the remainder of this year, it sounds like you're talking about a sort of a relatively flat market there. Do you see any risk to that? I mean, any continuation maybe of some of the headwinds we've seen in the second quarter here perhaps continuing through the rest of the year?","Clayton M. Jones","I think geographically, the -- probably the biggest areas where we see that impact is North America and Europe, which is not surprisingly. In Europe, because of economic conditions; in North America, because of the efficiency by which the airlines are operating. I saw a quick flash of the load factors of the U.S. airlines just in March, and I think the average is something like 83%, 84%. I mean, these are unprecedented levels of efficient management of how they operate the airplanes. So I think that those are the areas we're seeing it relative to the risk factor. I really don't see a lot -- just given the trends we've seen so far. We think we've got it pretty much determined. In fact, if there's anything, I think there's more opportunity than risk, because I -- but as I think everyone is already sort of factoring down and tightening up for their, I'd say, anxiety about the direction of the economy. And so having pre-prepared for a sort of soft economy, I think that's why they are where they are. And we've been sort of taken the optimism out of what we would have thought 6 months ago, and we put that now into our plan. If anything, if we see a little bit better traffic growth, we see a little bit better economic improvement, then we actually could see opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Sterne Agee & Leach.","Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","This is Josh for Peter. Your outlook for the Government business flattens out or begins to flatten out by 2015. How does that look if you break it into domestic versus international? And assuming there's an offset here, what are you assuming for growth in the out-years for the international military? And does the domestic budget mirror what's going on?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we've said, Josh, quite sometime ago that we're expecting higher growth in our international markets across-the-board, and we've talked about specific programs that we've won and more that we're pursuing to do that. In general, what we've said over the 5-year period is the international component of the defense is going to grow about 6%, and obviously it's very much higher than we're growing currently. In fact, I'd say we're at that rate right now. We'll see our international business component Government Systems pick up about 6% this year, and we think we can continue that with the programs we've got locked in. I think the return to growth that we're -- return to stability that we're talking about in 2015 occurs as a result of the stabilization of the largest defense market we serve, which is the United States. And interestingly enough, I think sequestration actually gives me more confidence we'll get to that point, because it drives the reset to the lower budget levels, which we think will occur this year and next. It just depend on those obligations that Noah asked earlier and how they flop, whether they're taken into this year and flat next year or whether they go down a little bit next year, which is I think what most of us are assuming it's going to happen. So for budgetary concerns, next year could be the low watermark. And then after that, the savings from defense are reset, and then the area under the curve is established. And actually, we'll -- we believe we'll see no further declines and maybe even growth via inflation, if the curve works like it's supposed to. I've said also that I think as a result of sequestration, maybe I am being overly optimistic, but I believe defense should be bulletproof now because of the roughly $2.3 trillion of savings that we've realized out of the budget action of sequestration. $1 trillion of that is coming from defense. So I think it's high time that we look at the real problems we have in the federal government, which is the entitlement spending, and start addressing that because I think defense gave at the office. And so if that plays out that way, that gives me confidence we'll be back to that flat by 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I thought I'd follow up on the same theme, actually, Clay. If we do see some stability in the defense budget over the next couple of years, is it your expectation we'll see some consolidation in the defense industry?","Clayton M. Jones","I think in times of lower budgets, especially kind of long-term lower budgets like this, you will always see some consolidation, Rob. The difference in this versus the period we went through in the early 90s is in the Cold War, as you'll see far less consolidation at the major prime level. The Defense Department has made it abundantly clear they believe that to have any kind of competition, they think they've got this sort of big 5 and the rough order prime capabilities where they need it. And at least currently, they're not very keen on either approving or even considering consolidation at level. So what you're probably going to see is more at the second and third tier level. And you may see that out of necessity, because there are going to be some of these smaller companies that are probably either going to exit the business or go out of business because there's not enough there to sustain them. And so I think that's more likely where you're going to see it.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But do you see Rockwell Collins as potentially acquiring or disposing in this situation?","Clayton M. Jones","I think that there's a time where we'll do both. I think there are going to be a large amount of sort of rationalization of portfolios in this sort of austere period. And a number of companies are probably looking hard at pieces of their business that were enjoying nice P\/E multiples 2, 3 years ago that are not doing so well. And so I'd -- I have said that there's -- we're looking at taking a hard look at all of our portfolios to see if they really do fit in the Rockwell Collins 5 years from now. And if we find that they're not, then we can see ourselves exiting a couple of businesses. But likewise, I think there will be other companies that see that maybe that they're not getting full value and they maybe a better fit for Rockwell Collins. What we've got to do is get to a period of stability in the industry where everybody at least knows what the future is going to be so they can rationally put together a business plan. And one of the reasons you've seen so little M&A in this sector over the last couple of years is because you can't do that. I think that they could be coming sooner now that we hopefully have a little bit more visibility into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A follow-up. You mentioned the strength in '15 to '17. And you mentioned by '15, the defense business could be flattish, kind of implying further decline, probably at a lower rate next year. And you've also seen 3 important programs, the CSeries, the Lear 85 and the Legacy have a 6 months slip, so they'll still be there but they'll be there later. And you're facing a higher tax rate next year. Can you give us some notional sense as we look at next year? Is that another transitional year before we start to grow again at a nice clip in '15?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, Cai, obviously, we don't want to give too much granular guidance till we get to the point where we do. But I think if you look at a macro level, a lot of what you've laid out there is a reasonable scenario. First of all, we do think that -- we haven't called us being back to flat by '14 in defense, so you can assume there still could be some decline, especially as the residual impact of sequestration is, what Noah mentioned before, falls over into '14 if we're not sure about. So I think that's not an unreasonable scenario. And while I think our Commercial business will still be good next year, as we've always said, we're largely dependent on our customers and our OEMs finishing those development programs on time and getting them the market when we'd hope they would for us to realize that benefit. We have no control over that, so long as obviously our development is going according to plan and we project and expect it to. And so we'll be watching very closely those schedules for things like the CSeries and the A350, both of which are flying here this year. And hopefully, we'll go and develop next year, but we're not sure when they will. I think we'll have a better look at that later in the year. And so that could be the one anomaly that we have to watch that could potentially erode some of the opportunity we thought we would have had next year. I would also say very quickly, though, that opportunity is not going to go away, just as we will enjoy over the next 2 years, finally, the benefit of the 787 ramp-up. Those things are going to happen. It's just a matter of when. And so we'll be looking very closely at that over the next few years. And I know Kelly in his new role will work his magic to make sure that when we come out in September, you'll know exactly what we think is going to happen.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen; the incoming Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller.","Today's call is being webcast and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Well, today marks my first official earnings call since I took over as CEO at the beginning of August. And at that time, I said it's full speed ahead for our company because I fundamentally believe in our overall strategy and that we're headed in the right direction.","We're well positioned in our markets. Our customer relationships are strong, thanks to a history of delivering on our commitments. We've had a unique and differentiating business model that leverages common investments and resources across commercial and government businesses. And we are very solidly -- we're very solid financially, with strong operating margins and cash flow, as well as a balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to make investments where we see good returns. And we have a seasoned management team and dedicated employees who are committed to our success and know what it takes to win. And these are just a few of the reasons I'm so confident about the future of Rockwell Collins.","But like any business, we're not without challenges. Our end markets in defense and the light end of business aviation remain near the bottom of their cycles. We've seen continued delays in new aircraft entering into service that have extended beyond any of our original expectations. And the political environment in the U.S. is making it increasingly difficult to plan our business, as no one knows what the next round in negotiations will yield.","As a result, we've struggled to generate top line growth for several years, despite what I feel have been well-laid plans. That's why when I took the helm, I also indicated that my #1 priority was to accelerate our company's return to growth, and we would achieve that growth by focusing our effort in 3 key areas: First, increasing our international business; second, enhancing and expanding our core capabilities; and third, building on our strong commitment to innovation, and I believe we're making progress on all fronts. So let me review a few of the highlights in each of these key areas.","On the international front, we continue to expand business in the Middle East with sales of our FireStorm targeting system and in Brazil with equipment on the KC-390 aircraft. In Europe, AgustaWestland selected our HeliSure Synthetic Vision and Terrain Awareness and Warning System for 4 of their helicopter platforms. And just yesterday, we announced that China Sichuan Airlines will be the launch customer of our PAVES on demand in-flight entertainment system for their narrow-body aircraft. And in the next few weeks, you'll hear more about our international progress through announcements at the upcoming Seoul and Dubai Airshows.","We made significant steps to expand our positions in our core markets this year. For example, we secured the large-format displays on the 737 MAX and grew our content on the A350. We accomplished our 787 ramp to support 7 aircraft a month. And we're on track to ramp up to full-scale production of 10 aircraft a month by the end of the calendar year.","In business and regional aviation, we experienced sales growth from Bombardier's Challenger and Global programs, as well as Beechcraft's King Airs. In fact, over the last 3 years, our business in regional OEM sales have increased by over 30% from $466 million to $612 million in a market that's been relatively -- seen relatively little growth. This growth was due to our strong market share capture, particularly at Bombardier and Gulfstream. And our strategy to diversify upmarket has helped us withstand the turbulence at the light end.","Our ongoing commitment to innovation was on display this week at the NBAA Convention in Las Vegas, where we announced several new innovations for both cabin and flight deck. Among these was our EVS-3000 Enhanced Vision System which uses a new proprietary multispectral sensor developed by our engineers to significantly improve the detection of outside terrain, hazards and obstacles in low-visibility weather conditions.","And earlier this month, the F-35 Joint Program Office announced it will focus exclusively on maturing the Helmet Mounted Display system codeveloped by Rockwell Collins and Elbit Systems of America, which leverages tremendous innovation and advanced technology to provide unprecedented situational awareness capabilities in support of that F-35 program.","These are all examples of our focus on executing our strategies to drive performance, accelerate our return to growth and ultimately, increase shareowner value. We effectively sized the risk related to sequestration and incorporated it into our plan, not only the negative revenue impact, but also ensuring we rightsize the company to maintain the level of operating margins we expect out of our business.","And in the end, we're seeing the results. We achieved our guidance range across the board and exceeded our guidance for both earnings per share and cash flow. More specifically, we generated over 21% total operating margins, grew earnings per share by 10% and improved cash flow by 16%. This performance was a testament to our commitment of our 19,000 employees around the world.","Now as we look to 2014, we proactively planned for the realities of the market. I believe we're well positioned to deliver strong operating earnings and cash flow.","Our Commercial Systems business is poised for growth, driven by 787 and A350 volume, as well as higher aftermarket demand. I do believe we've derisked the 2014 plan by baking in the realities of the recycling impact to our air transport MRO business, along with the effects of the delayed business jet recovery.","In addition, our Government Systems business will see much the same conditions in 2014 that we saw in 2013. We believe sequestration is here to stay and we've planned our fiscal 2014 just as we did in 2013. And we should also experience a full year of savings from the restructuring activity undertaken in fiscal year 2013, which is expected to allow us to once again generate operating margins greater than 20% despite these declining revenues.","As I look beyond 2014, our market share gains are expected to pay off, driven by our Commercial Systems business, where we expect double-digit growth for our air transport OEM sales, supported by continued growth from the 787, A350 and the CSeries. We anticipate air transport aftermarket revenues will be fueled by regulatory mandates and spares provisioning for new aircraft.","In business and regional, we see a path to OEM growth as a number of new aircraft where we've gained market share will enter production, specifically the Embraer Legacy and the Lear 85, as well as some yet to be announced platforms. Business and regional aftermarket revenues are expected to continue to grow through retrofits utilizing new product introductions, such as GPS-guided landing and cabin upgrades for larger aircraft.","In Government Systems, our return to growth after 2014 is based on the assumption that the U.S. spending will bottom out in 2014 and then stabilize in 2015. We also expect a number of programs will ramp up production such as the KC-10 and the E-6B aircraft updates, as well as the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System and the F-35 helmets. In addition, the international sales will be a key element of our growth strategy in Government Systems as we continue to penetrate markets and execute on these new programs.","So to summarize, we continue to improve efficiency to maintain our strong operating performance, and we've sustained our investment in R&D to support our long-term growth objectives. 2014 will be an important year in accelerating the growth trajectory of Rockwell Collins with increased production of new aircraft across our businesses. And we're entering a period of significant number of new aircraft where we'll be entering service, most of which will include increased Rockwell Collins content. And I'm confident that with our proven operating model, we'll convert these market positions into long-term profitable growth and drive increasing shareowner value for years to come.","Well, with that very strong foundation, we're about to add a very important growth platform accelerator through the acquisition of ARINC. This acquisition will advance our vision of becoming the leader in aviation information management. We have both an integration team and a synergy capture team doing the detailed planning and identifying opportunities right now. And while there's still a lot of work to do, I can tell you, I'm really excited about what I see on both fronts. Let me give you an example of the type of synergies we see with this acquisition.","Today, in business aviation flight departments, they have to use multiple services from multiple suppliers with multiple invoicing if they want the best in flight support services. Our Ascend International Trip Support is already a market leader. Now we can match it with ARINC Direct's online regional trip support tools, which are widely regarded as best in the industry. Add in ARINC's connectivity services and our flight operation system's scheduling and dispatch software and operators will have a one-stop shop for the best flight planning and operational services. Plus, these tools can all be integrated to share information and work together, making it easier to use, saving them time and reducing their operating costs, all from one source with one invoice. And this is just one example of the many synergies that we're expecting to result from this acquisition to help drive growth for the long-term future.","Now from a financial perspective, we should start seeing the benefits of cost synergies almost immediately. I expect to see this business grow its EBITDA margins to greater than 20% over the 5-year outlook. As we bring in some of the revenue synergies, I expect additional margin expansion along with double-digit revenue growth.","Now I know you're all starving for more detailed disclosure on ARINC, but the fact of the matter is we don't own them yet. The government shutdown has delayed the timing of the close of the transaction, but we're still hopeful we will see the necessary approvals by the end of the quarter. At that time, we plan to update our 2014 guidance and we're planning an investor conference to give you more details on ARINC, as well as provide a broader update on the longer-term outlook for Rockwell Collins overall. I look forward to that opportunity.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick for some additional details on our financial information.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. Let's get started by first reviewing our results for the total company that are shown on Slide 3. Total company sales for the quarter came in at $1.25 billion, a 1% decrease from last year. Net income increased 15%. While earnings per share increased 21%. Fourth quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings per share increased to $1.28 compared to $1.06 the same quarter last year, as the company continued to execute its capital deployment strategy through its share repurchase program the fourth quarter of 2013 benefited from the absence of a restructuring and asset impairment charge in 2012, and that was partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs in 2013.","Turning to Slide 4. We have the fourth quarter results for Commercial Systems, which reported revenues of $583 million, up 3% from last year. Aftermarket revenue grew $15 million or 6% to $254 million, driven primarily by retrofits related to regulatory mandate upgrades. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $3 million or 1% to $310 million. Sales to business and regional OEMs increased from higher deliveries for the Bombardier Global and Challenger aircraft, partially offset by fewer deliveries for Cessna business jets. Sales to air transport OEMs declined due to lower military HUD sales and lower engineering billings, partially offset by increases in 787 hardware deliveries.","Now Commercial Systems operating earnings were $122 million or 20.9% of sales, compared to operating earnings of $122 million or 21.6% of sales in the fourth quarter last year. Operating margins decreased 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2013 as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs and higher company-funded research and development expense. Excluding the impact of these items, incremental margins were greater than 50% for the quarter.","On Slide 5, Government Systems revenue declined 5% to $669 million. Avionics sales increased $10 million or 3%, primarily due to higher international tanker transport hardware sales, partially offset by lower -- the impact of lower simulator sales. Communication products sales declined $28 million or 16%, resulting from lower satellite and secured communication product sales, partially offset by increased deliveries in JTRS Manpack radios.","Surface Solutions sales increased $5 million or 9% from higher international FireStorm targeting system sales. Finally, Navigation Products sales were down 26% to $54 million, driven by lower deliveries of airborne and ground navigation products as a result of the withdrawal in Afghanistan and Iraq.","Government Systems fourth quarter operating earnings were $151 million or 22.6% of sales compared to $175 million or 25% last year. The lower operating earnings were primarily due to lower sales and the impact of higher employee incentive compensation costs.","On Slide 6, we have full year total company financial results for sales, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow.","In 2013, sales decreased by 2% as the headwinds in Government Systems were mostly offset by -- with growth in Commercial Systems. Our year-to-date operating cash flow of $617 million is $83 million or 16% higher than last year due to lower cash payments for income taxes and employee incentive pay, partially offset by other changes in working capital.","Slide 7 provides an update of our total R&D investment for the year. Total spend remained relatively consistent at 20% of sales. Company-funded R&D expense declined as we completed development efforts related to certain next-generation business jet programs. Customer-funded R&D expense decreased primarily due to the wind down of a number of development programs in Government Systems, such as E-6 and E-2D. Meanwhile, we increased investment in preproduction engineering programs, mostly related to the Boeing 737 Max program.","Moving to Slide 8. We show the status of our capital structure. As of the end of 2013, we had total debt outstanding of $999 million compared to $779 million at the end of 2012. The increase in short-term debt came from the issuance of commercial paper to fund share repurchases, as well as the reclassification of long-term debt that is due in December.","Our current intent is to refinance a portion of our maturing debts in the near term. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 38% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.9. As a reminder, pending the acquisition of ARINC will further increase our debt leverage, but we expect to retain our investment-grade credit rating, which will provide us the necessary access to liquidity in a cost-effective manner.","The funded status of our pension plans improved to $585 million over the last year as discount rates came in 92 basis points higher than last year. Our pension plan assets benefited from strong market returns and the $122 million in contributions we made during the year all contributed to that improvement. In October, subsequent to our year end, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $55 million. No further contributions are expected or required for the remainder of 2014.","If you turn to Slide 9, we've provided details related to the updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of 2013. During the year, we repurchased 9.8 million shares of stock at an average cost of $58.38 per share and reduced outstanding shares by 5%. That brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to 86 million shares or $4.3 billion return to shareowners through maintaining an active share repurchase program, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by 27%. Currently, our available authorization is $411 million.","Now on to our final slide, Slide 10, where we provide details of our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance, which is unchanged from when we originally provided it last month. We expect total sales of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, with Commercial Systems sales increasing mid-single digits. We anticipate this growth will come from higher Boeing 787 production, regulatory mandates, increased business jet cockpit upgrades and air transport spares for 787 and A350 aircraft.","In Government Systems, we forecast revenue to decline mid to high single digits. The decline is primarily due to an anticipated $200 million impact from a full year of sequestration. The sequestration impact is expected to be partially offset by an increase in international defense sales and increased production in Avionics, including the KC-10 and E-6B aircraft upgrades, as well as higher deliveries for the JHMCS and JSF helmets.","Full year operating margins are expected to be in the range of 21% to 22%, with Government Systems' operating margin stable above 20% and Commercial Systems' operating margins expanding about 50 basis points. Earnings before income taxes year-over-year is expected to be relatively flat, and earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50 reflects a 300 basis point increase in our tax rate over 2013 due to the anticipated expiration of the R&D tax credit in December. Cash flow from operations is expected to be $550 million to $650 million.","Now that completes my review of the financial results and projections. But before we go to Steve for the Q&A section, I wanted to hand it back to Kelly for one final comment.","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, thanks, Pat. I want to acknowledge a transition that will be taking place in our investor relations function. You likely saw an announcement earlier this week that Steve Buesing is moving on to be our Vice President and Controller of our Commercial Systems business. And I've received a lot of feedback from many of you about the very professional job that Steve has done over the past 3 years. And I'd like to publicly acknowledge his great work on behalf of our company and our shareowners.","Our new Investor Relations lead will be Ryan Miller. Ryan comes out of our finance organization where he's held a number of leadership positions over the last 10 years. And Ryan and Steve have been working together very closely over the last month. And my expectation is that we won't miss a beat in terms of providing the kind of service that you all expect from our company. So Steve, thank you very much. And Ryan, welcome aboard and good luck.","With that, Steve, we can move to the Q&A.","Steve Buesing","Well, thanks, Kelly. I appreciate the kind words and I really will miss the interactions with all of you. [Operator Instructions] So Shannon, we're ready for you to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the R&D? It looked like you came in less than the $950 million target for the year, and then also the growth in preproduction was less than expected. So what accounted for the change? And then does that push it into '14, where '14 ends up coming in a little bit higher?","Patrick E. Allen","Sam, the answer is yes. The change in deferred production engineering compared to our expectations was largely a shift from '13 into '14. And due to, I'll say, delays in our anticipated start in programs like the 737 MAX, I did a little bit of -- C-series that shifted from '13 into '14. So the aggregate spend hasn't changed. And what you're going to see, whereas -- when we started the year, I would have anticipated a pretty significant decline from '13 to '14. I think it's going to be closer to flat to maybe even slightly up as a result of those delays.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Kelly, I wondered if you might talk a little bit about the Commercial Systems aftermarket and what that may have looked like x the regulatory mandate sales, just trends you're seeing there. It seemed like that might be a little bit light of what you were expecting. I wonder if you could just discuss the moving pieces a little bit for us.","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes. Let me characterize the aftermarket in CS because I think that's an area where it certainly didn't play out as we had originally anticipated as we came into the year. I'd say there's 2 areas where we saw things different than we expected. One is in the air transport MRO, where we saw the effect of recycling of parts as they were retiring aircraft. And I think we pretty well predicted the retirements where we had not anticipated was the amount of recycling of equipment. We saw that early in the year and went -- and updated our models. And I will tell you that I think we've got that well understood now and we've got that incorporated into our fiscal year '14 guidance. So I don't think you're going to see that any longer as a headwind. I think we've understood it and forecasted it going forward. The second area that has been good is the air transport spares as well as the updated mandates. We did see what we expected with TCAS, and data-link mandates start to drive some revenue in the second half of next year and we're anticipating that will continue to accelerate here in 2014 as well. So that's kind of our air transport. In business aviation, we, first of all, always had a kind of a back half loaded plan in business aviation. We've seen very good takeup in cabin systems upgrades, particularly with VVIP-type aircraft, so that market's doing quite well. We have not met our expectations in some of the modifications, avionics mods. The market is growing, just not quite as fast as we had anticipated. We had a pretty aggressive plan this year. And I'll tell you that like we did with the MRO, I've dialed that back to more of a conservative forecast going forward to reflect what we've seen this year. So I think we've got a good handle on our overall Commercial Systems aftermarket, and we derisked the areas that we saw in '13 in our '14 guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Stallard of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kelly, on the ARINC deal, I understand you can't give us that much more information. But I thought one of the things you might be able to get a handle on is the potential deal costs that you are likely to incur. I was wondering if you could give us any steer on that.","Patrick E. Allen","Rob, this is Patrick. Let me give you maybe a little bit more detail. As we talked in September, we were looking at a situation where we were going to be slightly to somewhat dilutive because of the deal costs and because of the integration costs. We've been working that pretty heavily. And I would say this, if I adjust our results for both ARINC and the impending sale of KOSI,I think the net impact of those 2 things are going to be neutral to somewhat accretive to earnings. So we've improved the results since the last time we talked. The deal costs, I think, are going to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Unfortunately, they're going up because of the delay in the HSR filing, so we've gotten a little bit more legal costs. But we're seeing those transaction costs kind of in the $10 million to $15 million range. And I would also tell you, from a cash flow perspective, as I look at the first 12 months of cash flow coming out of ARINC, it's going to add roughly -- probably about 10% to our operating cash flow. So it's going to be cash flow accretive, it's not going to be significantly dilutive to our earnings over the course of the next year and I share Kelly's excitement with respect to the transaction.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the business jet forecast that's embedded in the '14 outlook. I guess you provided your '14 outlook in September and cited pressures at Cessna, specifically offsetting strength elsewhere. Then Cessna reported in October and took the Cessna number down again and I guess, spoke to even more pressure in the market for them. Can you just walk us through the dynamics or the math of how that is or it's not fully embedded in your outlook? That would be helpful.","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes. So we've seen Cessna come down with rates throughout the year. When -- we had advanced notice of what Cessna just released when we put together our '14 guidance. Their -- they've reduced their production rates to almost a de minimis level here, going into fiscal '14 and we factored that into our forecast and that's in our guidance. So we're not anticipating any recovery at Cessna for production rates. Now what we will see, and that's what driving our year-on-year comp, is that they've come down throughout the year, and so we're going to see a full year next year at that lower rate.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have to ask, ARINC, so if it's going to be, it and KOSI sale, are going to be neutral or slightly positive. Is essentially the profit on KOSI an offset to the deal costs and integration costs?","Patrick E. Allen","I think that's a good way to think about it. I would describe it as a partial offset. And then the remaining offset of the deal and integration costs would be the earnings from ARINC.","Operator","Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","I'm going to try to make it in 2 questions. But one, do you -- Kelly, the commercial OE was down 1% in the quarter. I mean, virtually everybody else is up near growth of 10%. So if you could get a little more color on what's happened there and why it's still going to be double -- low double-digit growth in '14. And just a simple one for you, Patrick. Was incentive comp in the quarter up around $20 million versus last year?","Robert K. Ortberg","Yes. Let me take the ATS fourth quarter OEM. We had a muddy comp in the fourth quarter. The decline is as -- was discussed in the prepared remarks, really, military HUDs that we delivered last year that created a comp headwind. And we also had a bunch of cleanup of non-recurring 787 activity at the end of last year. If you took that out, we would have grown at mid-single digit, and we did see sequential growth of about 3%. So the 787 ramp has happened per our plan. And I think you're going to see us come out of the shoots in '14 comparable to what we guided in terms of OEM growth there in air transport. So I would look at the fourth quarter as kind of just a muddy comp.","Patrick E. Allen","And George, to answer your second question, the year-over-year, it was actually a little bit higher than $20 million, but yes, about $20 million -- between $20 million and $25 million.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Patrick, can you tell us a bit about the KOSI sale? Is there any loss of earnings that we have to think about associated with that?","Patrick E. Allen","There is a -- I would say, there's a very modest -- it's not going to change our guidance with respect to Government Systems' operating earnings or operating margin for the year.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Kelly, back to your kind of opening comment about repositioning the company for growth, you gave us kind of the 3 pillars that you're focused on. One of those that wasn't focused on M&A, but clearly, you've done a big deal with ARINC. I'm just curious, is ARINC an exemption to your growth strategy, or is it an indication that you're thinking about being more acquisitive on a go-forward basis beyond ARINC?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, I talked about expanding our core market, and that's -- acquisitions clearly fit in that category for us. So we were addressing this information management space through both organic development, as well as inorganic development before ARINC with the purchase of Air Routing and our flight operations system. So I see this as just an expansion -- a highly accelerated expansion into our core markets and some relative of close adjacencies that were associated with that. As I look forward, we'll continue to look for those opportunities, particularly opportunities that can help us further cement the glue between the Rockwell Collins capabilities and the ARINC capabilities going forward to create further synergies for the business.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Kelly, I wanted to look at the biz jet market at a high level structurally. Just coming out of NBAA and your comments earlier about how -- yes, we all know the light jet market is near the bottom. I wanted to ask if you think there's actually some vulnerability or exposure in the heavy jet market, and then overall talk about maybe a switch toward an upgrade-driven opportunity set, where the attractiveness of aircraft in the used fleet, given their pricing, their availability, is perhaps driving people away from new aircraft buys. And so would that be a more interesting part of the market going forward, given what's been going on in the new aircraft demand environment?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, a lot of questions there. Let me address a couple of them. No, we don't see major weakness at the high end of the market, so no change in our outlook there. Nothing coming out of NBAA gives me any pause there. I also have heard nothing coming out of NBAA that gives me any confidence that the light end is -- that we've got any upside on the light end. I think it's still pretty soft. The aftermarket, has always been an area where we've been focused. And we've seen growth this year and we're anticipating growth next year with cabin and flight deck upgrades. One thing that was announced, which is really good news, is Nextant announced that they're going to upgrade another -- up to 50 aircraft, Hawker 400 upgrades, and those are big Pro Line 2 to Pro -- or Pro Line 4 to Pro Line 21 upgrades, a very good opportunity for us in the aftermarket. So yes, I think that we're going to continue -- while we're down in the new-build, we're going to continue to exploit that aftermarket, and we're bringing new products into the market. We've done that this year and we'll continue to do that going forward to help stimulate some of that demand. A couple of big announcements we made at NBAA, I mentioned, we launched our new compact HUD and our EVS sensor, with a launch customer down at Embraer. And we also launched a new -- the first 3D moving map, which we think is going to have a lot of good uptake in the aftermarket, enhanced wireless capability with our Venue Cabin System. So these are all the types of things we're doing to help stimulate demand while the new aircraft buys are depressed.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I want to sort of look at last year's numbers for a comp for a second, Patrick. If I'm not mistaken, it was a $26 million charge in the year ago. And I think you talked about $75 million of benefit that should accrue to the company. And I guess some of it's hard to do because revenues have changed and there's -- nothing's ever perfect. But can you sort of do a little bit of a walk in how effective you've been at capturing the restructuring benefits that you're talking about?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. We've tracked those restructuring benefits. Actually, on a monthly basis, we reported out to Clay and now Kelly. And I would tell that we have exceeded our expectations with respect to savings slightly, but -- so we have tracked it and we have gotten -- we have captured those savings. I would tell you that the savings are partially in 2013 and will have a full -- the full benefit in 2014. And you're right, you're not going to see it necessarily as margin dilution because some of it had to occur just to stave off the natural margin effects of lower volume.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on that. So I mean, is that why your incrementals -- you can -- you're capturing are on the order of 50%?","Patrick E. Allen","That's certainly part of it, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just a really big picture question for you, Kelly. I think we've had a lot of detail so far. As you've gotten into this new role and taken over this new role, as you look forward, what do you see as the 1 or 2 or 3 biggest challenges confronting you as the new leadership of the company?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, as I said, I think our strategic direction is very sound. I feel really good about the long-term prospects. We've won a lot of positions. We don't have to go win a whole lot of things. Keeping our team focused at the light at the end of the tunnel in defense is always a challenge. As they're battling, they've done a remarkable job of managing through this defense cycle. And keeping them focused on those opportunities and they're doing a good job at that. Executing our business is absolutely critical. It's one thing to win, but we've got to go execute the business. And we've seen case studies of where, if we don't execute, what that can -- what can happen. And so we're very focused on executing, delivering on time, creating that long-term opportunity and making sure we meet the margin performance of all these new products we're bringing into market. So we're spending a lot of time focused on that. But I feel pretty good about the opportunities there. And I think we're on track to deliver that shareowner value with that market share gain that we've captured.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, more specifically, is there any 1 or 2 things you're currently spending more time on that's kind of key focus of your day now?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, obviously, a key part of it is ARINC. Making sure we integrate ARINC is -- and integrate it right, get the cost synergies and put in place the processes and procedures to capture the revenue synergies across our businesses are key priorities for me. And I'm spending a lot of time with our teams getting prepared for that. I mean, we're going to do that one right. It's a big one. It's going to create a lot of value, and so that's going to take some energy from our management team to make sure we do that.","Operator","Our next question is from David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Kelly, wanted to follow-up on the business jet and RJ side of the business. Obviously, a little bit surprising that, that business is going to be down in its entirety this year given some of the programs you have ramping up, C-Series, Lear 85, Legacy 500. Could you talk about where we are with those programs, because it doesn't seem like they're helping a lot this year? And I was just going to throw try and slide another one into Patrick real quick. I just want to know, Patrick, inventory x preproduction, what does inventory do this year?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, we've long said that the real growth, there's not going to be a lot of growth in the business aviation market beyond the new aircraft entries. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we've seen very good growth, 30% over the last 3 years. And it's all driven by new aircraft entry. Unfortunately, in 2014, we don't have a lot of tailwind of new entries. We've got the Lear and the Legacys, but they come in pretty late in the year, not enough to offset the decline in production. I mean, it's a dramatic decline in production at Cessna. And unfortunately, until we get those airplanes and get a full year of production for the new entries, we're just not going to be able to offset that.","Patrick E. Allen","And from an inventory perspective, we saw a little bit of growth this year. I would describe most of it as being more timing related than anything else. As I look at the plan for '14, I think inventories are going to be flat to slightly down in the current -- with our current plan.","Operator","Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up on the MRO aftermarket. Can you give us a sense, quantitatively, has that business been flat? Is it down, is it up a bit? And then in your plan for the next year, do you anticipate it again being flat or do you expect it to come down a bit? And then just in terms of modeling for next year, can you just give us some sense of the quarterly pace of revenue since there are a lot of moving parts these days?","Patrick E. Allen","Yair, the way I'd describe it is the MRO piece of our aftermarket has been up slightly, I would say in the low single digits. And we're projecting pretty much the same environment next year. A little bit more growth in the air transport side than on the business jet side, but we're looking at that kind of low to mid single digit growth on -- in the MRO piece of the aftermarket. Now that's going to be off compared to the -- what I'll call the discretionary aftermarket, where we're going to see better growth in that area in both business jet and in air transport.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then in terms of the quarterly pacing of revenues next year?","Patrick E. Allen","I think it's going to be pretty much what you saw this year. I don't -- there isn't going to be a lot of variation, at least, as we see it today in the growth in Commercial Systems or in the decline in the Government Systems. The only thing I'd say is you have to -- you always have to watch it -- watch for the aftermarket because that tends to be the lumpiest piece of the business and particularly, the discretionary aftermarket.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a very quick question here, I know a lot has been asked. On the $170 million in preproduction engineering costs, I know you said it was driven by the MAX and business jets. I wanted to know if there was any 777X in there. If you think that Boeing launches the 777X in November, if you think there's any upside to that number in 2014, or do you think that probably rolls in, in '15?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, there is no 777X in there yet. We haven't -- Boeing hasn't made any decisions in our commodity areas on the 777X. And we are actively doing some trade study work with them, but that's very low level from an expense perspective. We would expect that they'll be running competitions over the next 6 months. And so we wouldn't start any material development in our commodity scheme on 777X in fiscal '14. It will probably be more in '15.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Kelly, I wanted to ask you on the IFE. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks and you had a press release earlier this week with just [ph] -- and you've got a launch customer for it. Can you just kind of update us, now that it's out there, on what your expectations are with regard to the size of the market, potential growth there, what the pipeline looks like, and then maybe, just lastly, what the product looks like? I noticed that in its initial one, you've got some in-seat IFE and some overhead IFE that's going on. And just kind of what your expectations are going forward with the mix in that product and what you think you're going to be selling?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, first of all, there's no change in our overall strategy of focusing on single-aisle in-flight entertainment and exiting and not focusing on the twin aisle. The PAVES product is -- has been a very successful product in the single-aisle market, and that market is going through a transition. Historically, it's been an overhead with drop-down displays, not in-seat displays, in the single-aisle market. We're seeing that move to an in-seat primarily, at least initially, that in-seat will be more in the front end of the airplane in the first class. But over the long term, we would expect to see in-seat video capability across the single-aisle market. And that's why we've introduced this new product, which is an in-seat video capability. And the neat thing is technology is allowing us to do that in a much more efficient way than in the past and provide a much more reliable solution. So we actually see that as both a good growth opportunity for positions with the narrow-body production for a bit, but also as potential retrofit opportunities going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Kelly, just to actually stay on that topic, we're actually seeing part of a move in this IFE kind of market, especially on the narrow-body with either portable displays kind of iPad -- iPods-like, iPad-like, I mean, or bring your own device. How did that PAVES kind of fit into that market?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, I think it's -- that those decisions are kind of on a customer-by-customer basis. Some view that the iPads and -- are going to provide the service that they want. I think that the airlines that are focused on using the IFE system to sell product don't want to rely on someone else to bring it into the airplane. And so you're going to see them use that as a venue to upsell in -- to their end customers. We -- again, we think that initially, you'll see the in-seat capability go into most single-aisle aircraft going forward in the business and first class and then maybe a split market in terms of the overhead versus in-seat for coach going forward. Now you will see continued focus on connectivity and providing connectivity capability so that people can bring their mobile devices on the airplane. I don't think anybody's going to stop doing that. But I think we'll still see take-up in in-seat capability as well.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And Patrick, if I could slip one more. Incremental margins on the 787, will those still be a drag as you guys get to kind of the 10 per month. How should we think about that?","Patrick E. Allen","It's going to be a drag to the incremental margins slightly, just a little bit. I mean, it's going to be well in excess of our operating margins, but a little bit lower than our traditional incremental margins for the next year or so.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Kelly, I'd like to dig in -- or Patrick, dig in a little bit to the defense outlook that you guys are, I guess, down mid to high is what you're saying this year. In the past, you've said -- or Clay has said, I believe, that this was hoped -- you guys were hoping this would be a trough year. I was wondering if you still believe that or if you think there might be more pressure in '15. A lot of the bigger primes seems likely that 2015 is going to be a down year, just on -- due to the late cycle versus early cycle nature of their businesses. And then just within '14, looking in defense, what are the moving parts that you're looking at? How big is international now? What are the risks there, that things slipped out of your plan? And then what are the big competitions? I know the Manpack competition is probably a big one for you guys. What else is in there that you're looking at?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, yes. So let me characterize the -- maybe 2014. So we put sequestration into the plan. We've focused that at about -- or forecasted that at about $200 million. And then we've guided in the mid to high single digit. As I look at that, first of all, our business is much different than the large OEMs. We go into the year with roughly 30% of our sales for that particular year anticipated or not in backlog, so we're much shorter cycle business. And we've seen the impact of these budget cuts faster than the OEMs. But the good news is, as we're coming out of that, they'll be burning off prior year money while we'll be focused on current year money. And we'll come out of that growth a little faster than them. As I look at our next year's plan, again, we've put sequestration into it. If you look at 2013, we actually performed a little bit better. We ended up about $70 million versus $120 million. I think there's one causal there is that DOD did spend a lot of prior year unallocated funds to offset some of the sequester. And I don't think we're going to see that in 2014. But I think, as you look at it, we've got it pretty well sized. And if I look at what the risks and opportunities are, there's a couple of big programs that I'm watching. You mentioned one, HMS. Our plan is that we will go to an additional low rate initial production award for '14 and go to full-scale competition for important deliveries that will happen in '15. That award is not yet made and the Army is debating as to whether they want to combine production or low rate initial production. So that's one that we're really watching and could have some implications to the year. The other is the KC-10 program. And you've probably seen some press where the Air Force is considering whether they retire the KC -- accelerate the retirement of the KC-10 fleet. We've just completed the development of the CNS\/ATM upgrade for the KC-10s. And in fiscal '14, we'll start the production and modification. And if they would either delay that or cancel that program, that would have some implications to our plan. So as I kind of think of that, I'd say if we get hit with those programs and they don't happen, we'll probably be more to the high side of our guidance. If those programs continue to go forward as we currently plan, then we'll probably be more to the low side of the guidance in defense.","Patrick E. Allen","And I think it's fair to say that we still view 2014 as being the trough here for defense where I think it's going to flatten out in '15. Now there's a lot of -- there's still a lot of uncertainty to the environment. But I think it is fair to say that we are a shorter-cycle business, so I think we're going to feel the pain earlier and hopefully get out of it quicker.","Operator","Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Patrick, I certainly can appreciate how ARINC is going to be a bit of a headwind to your capital returns to shareholders, but you sort of mentioned how accretive it's going to be on a cash flow basis. And of course, there's a good slide in the presentation here on how important repurchases have been over the years for Collins. So I was hoping that you could just sort of give us an update both on your philosophy as well as any metrics, leverage or liquidity that are top of mind when just think about scaling your repurchase, your capital returns in a kind of a post-ARINC world.","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, I would say that first of all, our capital deployment philosophy hasn't changed. We've always said that we want to grow the business and absent growth opportunities, want to make sure we return capital to our shareowners. And we've played that out over -- since I've been in this role. Obviously, the one difference is we had a significant acquisition opportunity in ARINC. And therefore, it had a fairly significant call on our capital. As I look forward about -- with respect to our capital structure, we've said that we are committed to paying off the commercial paper portion of the ARINC deal over a short period of time. I look at it as being about 2 years. How much of that is, it's about $500 million of the total acquisition. So we're just going to still have a small budget for share repurchases over the next couple of years. And then I would say, as we get out of that period, you'll see -- absent other acquisition opportunities, you'll see us step up share repurchases beyond that.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Kelly, I know this will probably be addressed in your investor conference, but I wanted to ask about ARINC. The original discussion, I think, discussion was this was going to be a real great kind of revenue synergy story. But it sounds like you've -- talking about cost synergies and getting EBITDA margins up into -- above 20%. Could you maybe, at a high level, kind of discuss maybe what's -- whether you've identified some significant cost synergies and how that kind of paces out over that 5-year plan?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, the cost synergies come in earlier than the revenue synergies. So that's the real focus. I would say, don't misinterpret my words here. We still see a lot of revenue growth synergy opportunity, but we also see those cost synergies. They're primarily around integration of the corporate functions. Integrating them into our business model will provide us real quick savings. And combining some of what they're doing in their business aviation market with ARINC Direct and what we're doing in the business aviation with Ascend will provide us some pretty quick synergy opportunities going forward. So those are the things. As I look, we put out the pro forma 2012 EBITDA to give you some indication of where they are. You got to kind of project that through 2013. The cost synergies will hit real soon. And then we do have a few real immediate revenue synergies that we'll be banging on right away, but most of those take a little time. We may have to develop some products or some software to bring those in. And those will feather in and provide that incremental growth in the out years.","Operator","Our last question is from Ken Herbert of Canaccord.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So just wanted to follow-up on the 2014 guidance, specifically within commercial transport on the spare parts side. I know initial provisioning seems like it's been a lot slower for the last couple of years than expected. Can you just talk about the assumptions in '14 for spare parts sales, specifically in support of provisioning, and then maybe just provide a little more granularity on Intertrade? And specifically, Kelly, you talked about some of your -- won't be a headwind in '14 because you've adjusted -- it's reflected in guidance on the recycled parts side. But maybe what are those assumptions, and how do you see that playing out over the course of the year?","Robert K. Ortberg","Well, the air transport spares will be driven by new aircraft entering to service. And we've got 787 spares in the plan that's been a growth driver for us. It's probably about the same. It's driven by the number of new customers that Boeing has that really drives the initial provisioning. And the new customers in '14 are about the same as what we saw in 2013. We will probably get our first new customer provisioning for the A350 at the end of the year. So we're looking towards that going forward. I'm sorry, the second part of your question? Intertrade. Our Intertrade business is growing. We're on the other side of this recycling phenomenon with our Intertrade business. And we're buying aircraft, doing teardown of those aircraft and moving those parts into the marketplace and we're seeing good growth. We saw growth in 2013 there, and we're projecting similar growth going forward in '14.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today at our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those detailed on Slide 2 of the webcast presentation and from time to time in the Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody on the line. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter 2012 earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales were down slightly, while segment operating earnings increased by 2%.","Earnings per share decreased $0.09, but prior year results included a $0.13 benefit from the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit when compared to this year. If you adjust for the differences in the R&D tax credit, our earnings per share would have been up 5%.","Now I understand that these headline numbers may look relatively unexciting. But it gets a lot more interesting when you look below the headlines, especially considering some of the market conditions we currently face. For example, in Commercial Systems sales increased 13% in the quarter with a robust 14% growth from both OEM and aftermarket segments. And commercial operating margins expanded 170 basis points, fueled by 41% incremental margins after excluding a favorable customer incentive release recorded last year.","During the first quarter, we realized the benefit from initial 787 and 747-8 spare sales as these 2 new Boeing aircraft entered service. In fact, most of our aftermarket growth in both Commercial segments was the increased spare sales. Now these sales, while traditionally the lumpiest portion of our business, are the type of additional volume that we expect to fuel double-digit aftermarket growth for the full year.","I would also note that this performance was delivered without the benefit of any meaningful overall business jet OEM market recovery. ","Now meanwhile, Government Systems was able to maintain their industry-leading operating margins above 20% despite a 10% or $67 million decline in sales. In an environment where our top line has become more difficult to predict, I'm really proud of our team's focus on the things within our control as we continue to take aggressive actions to rightsize the infrastructure of this business based on market conditions.","Now as we've been predicting, we face one more quarter of difficult comparability in Government Systems as the effects of program cancellations and a large slowdown in procurement of our Defense Advanced GPS Receiver play through our top line. However, I am increasingly confident that the significant improvements we forecast for the second half of the fiscal year will happen. And here's why.","We expect sales of the KC-46, KC-10 and KC-390 tanker programs to continue to accelerate through the year, along with the F-15 foreign military sale through Boeing to Saudi Arabia. We should also see growing sales of the fifth generation ARC-210 airborne radio system, as well as increased deliveries of our FireStorm targeting system to international customers.","With the risk of an extending -- extended continuing resolution behind us and our backlog strengthening, we believe Government Systems can achieve mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year.","Now as I look out beyond the current fiscal year, I also see opportunities to accelerate growth in both segments. In Commercial Systems, these include 787 production ramp-up, the introduction of the CSeries, the A350 and multiple international regional jets, and a market recovery for business jets. In Government Systems, I expect selected growth opportunities in areas such as tankers, UAVs, the JTRS HMS program, ARC-210 radios, our next-generation GPS products for the MGUE program and international opportunities, including the Saudi F-15 I mentioned earlier, helicopter retrofits, FireStorm targeting systems, KC-390, C-130 upgrades, and various communication programs.","These long-term growth drivers, coupled with our consistent track record of effectively managing through dynamic market cycles, give me confidence there's a bright future ahead for Rockwell Collins.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk through the financial details. Pat?","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay. Good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of 2012.","I'll begin on Slides 3 and 4 where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, EPS, net income and operating cash flow.","Total company sales for the quarter decreased $10 million or 1% compared to last year's sales, while income from continuing operations and earnings per share decreased by 13% and 10%, respectively. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by a higher effective tax rate, which went from 21.5% last year, up to 33% in 2012.","First quarter 2011 results included a favorable adjustment related to the retroactive extension of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit. In addition, the prior year tax rate included a full year benefit from the R&D tax credit, while the current year tax rate has only 3 months\u2019 benefit. ","The accounting rules require us to average the benefit across the full fiscal year, which adversely impacted our effective tax rate.","The combined impact of these 2 items was $21 million or $0.13 per share. If you exclude the impact of these tax-related items, first quarter 2012 earnings per share would have increased by $0.04 or 5% compared to last year.","Looking next to our operating cash flow results for the first quarter. We used $64 million compared to our source of $57 million in last year's first quarter. The increased usage of cash was primarily driven by $62 million of higher employee incentive compensation payments as we traditionally pay the prior year's incentive payments in the first quarter of the following year. The increase in incentive payments reflects a fully reinstated payout after we had only partially reinstated it last year.","Additionally, we made a $47 million payment to our qualified pension plan, which we didn't have last year, and there is $20 million of higher income tax payments related to the differences in the availability of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.","Turning to Slides 5 and 6, we have the first quarter results of Commercial Systems, which achieved revenue of $511 million in 2012, up 13% from $454 million in 2011. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $32 million or 14% to $265 million, primarily resulting from increased deliveries for the Bombardier Global and Challenger platforms and increased sales to Boeing for the 777 and 747-8 platforms.","Aftermarket sales increased $27 million or 14% to $221 million. Aftermarket revenue grew mostly from increased sales of spares related to new Boeing aircraft, paramilitary programs and Chinese regional jets, as well as higher service and support sales.","Commercial Systems operating earnings increased 23% to $101 million in 2012 with operating margin expanding from 18.1% to 19.8%. The increase in operating earnings and margin was primarily due to the incremental earnings flow on our sales growth, offset somewhat by the absence of a $7 million favorable adjustment recorded last year.","Moving on to Slide 7. Government Systems revenue decreased by 10% to $583 million in 2012. Sales of Avionics increased $9 million or 3% as increased sales on the KC-46, KC-10 and KC-390 tankers as well as rotary wing programs more than offset the decline in simulation and training and the completion of a KC-135 GATM program last year.","Communication product sales declined $12 million or 8% primarily due to lower Joint Tactical Radio System revenue for the Ground Mobile Radio variant, as well as fewer deliveries of satellite communications terminals.","Surface Solutions decreased $46 million or 43% as the impact of 2 program cancellations from last year worked through our results, and we delivered fewer public safety vehicle systems.","Finally, sales of navigation products declined by $18 million or 25% resulting from fewer deliveries of our hand-held GPS receivers.","On Slide 8, Government Systems' first quarter operating earnings decreased $14 million from last year, while operating margins held flat at about 20%. The decreased operating earnings resulted from the lower sales volume, but operating performance remained consistent to last year primarily due to the benefits realized from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of last year and additional cost reduction actions taken in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.","Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. In addition to $777 million of long-term debt, we had $48 million of short-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40%, which is a bit higher than we have had in recent history. Even with the higher debt-to-total-capital, we continue to feel that our current debt leverage in combination with our investment-grade credit ratings provides us the ability to fund our growth needs cost effectively.","The updated status of our share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the first quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares at an average cost of $54.6 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 70 million shares or $3.4 billion return to shareowners through maintaining an active share repurchase program. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $318 million. ","Now onto our final slide, Slide 11, where we provided the details of our fiscal year 2012 financial guidance. We have not changed any of the specific details of the guidance, but I thought I should take a moment to remind you of a few key aspects of that guidance, as well as provide a few additional details. ","As Clay mentioned before, we expect the second quarter to be the last of our difficult comparables for Government Systems, followed by mid-single digit, year-over-year growth in the second half of the year.","This tough comparable is expected to drive total company sales growth down about 3% to 5% for the second quarter. In addition to the double-digit decline in Government Systems, Commercial Systems growth is expected to be in the upper single digits as last year's second quarter was particularly strong with initial deliveries of Pro Line Fusion for the Bombardier Global aircraft and a favorable sales mix of selectable hardware within air transport.","In the second half of the year, we expect total company sales to grow in the high-single digits to achieve our $4.9 billion to $5 billion guidance range. Total segment operating margin should continue to expand across the remainder of the year and result in a range of 20.5% to 21.5%.","We also still expect the full year tax rate to be about 30%, but anticipate the quarterly profile will be volatile. We expect to close out certain tax examinations during our second quarter resulting in a favorable benefit to our effective rate, which should be about 25% for the second quarter. The rest of the year should then average 31% to bring us to a 30% rate for the full year.","Finally, as we told you last quarter, we did take action to get more aggressive on our share repurchases. We expect to remain active for the remainder of the year, albeit at a more normal rate when compared to the first quarter. ","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Steve, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. Clay, could you delve into the aftermarket a little bit more, the 14%, and perhaps call out some of those items, the paramilitary and others that you mentioned and how we should think about a normalized aftermarket growth for the rest of the year?","Clayton M. Jones","I'll make an attempt here, Rob. As I said in my opening remarks -- well, let me parse it out. The largest part of the aftermarket is our MRO. It was up about 5% this quarter, and that's about a steady state. That matches, I think, traffic growth in the typical out-of-warranty aircraft and all the things that we get benefit from that. So I think that's going to be very stable and I think it's probably the most predictable thing we have. The largest segment now, and I think the newest thing, is the sales of these initial spares for new aircraft, and then just I would say the normal sparing for legacy aircraft through the year. This will represent the biggest part, certainly, of our discretionary aftermarket growth and is probably the most significant and noteworthy, I'll say, new opportunity we're seeing this year. It's going about as we predicted. And so when we look at those customers, for example, that are taking full spares versus doing our power by the hour, what we call dispatch 100 program, it's breaking about like we thought it would. And so that's been pretty much according to our plan, which again gives us that confidence that our forecast for the year is in line. And then I guess, the third bucket in the aftermarket is everything else. These are retrofits and upgrades of cockpits for business and air transport aircraft as we upgrade those. That was a little light this quarter, but we expect that to get better because, as we all know, very lumpy depending on what the customer expectations are, taking the airplane down, a lot of those variables. The paramilitary is an extremely kind of hit-and-miss thing. You all remember last year, we had the Project Liberty project that did this. This is a new project called Java Man, which is a King Air platform where they were sparing for that, so that's why we had that bump-up this quarter. But again, as we've always said, when we get into that area, it's particularly lumpy, and that's going to kind of come and go through the rest of the year. But I think the big source of confidence we have now and I would say the largest new growth area, are these initial spares.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly for Patrick. With regard to the cash flow and balance sheet, you had talked about the inventory going up, I think, about $130 million this year. It's done most of that here in the first quarter. So how should we think about inventory playing out over the remainder of the year? And then just to clarify on the share repurchase, are you essentially saying you will fulfill the rest of the authorization in this calendar year -- in this fiscal year, and that's what we should assume?","Patrick E. Allen","Let me take the inventory question first. If you parse through the inventory increase in the first quarter, about half of it relates to increase in our production inventory, which is a what I'll describe as a normal seasonal build. We tend to level load our factory, and first quarter is generally the lightest quarter, especially this year, we have quite a good back-end loaded sales. So we expect to burn that inventory off over the course of the balance of the year. The remaining half of the inventory increase is comprised of 2 things. One is an increase in the deferred engineering, which is that $120 million or so you were referring to, we\u2019re expecting to increase over the course of the year. The other half was a decline in progress payments from our customers. We had talked about, I'll say, payments from customers coming down last year. I think it's stabilized. What we saw really was a swing between progress payments and advanced payments against receivables this quarter. And so that was sort of cash neutral, but it showed up as an increase in inventory because progress payments came down. So all in all, what I would say is we continue to expect about that increase in inventory. It's going to be mostly related to deferred engineering, and we expect the production piece of the inventory to burn off over the course of the balance of the year. As it relates to share repurchases, I wouldn't go so far as to say that we're going to burn through the remainder of the authorization. But I will say we'll continue to be active in the share repurchase program over the course of the next 3 quarters, and you'll continue to see our share count come down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Clay, on the business jet side, how far are you through the Global Express ramp-up so far? Are you up to full rate?","Clayton M. Jones","I'd say, Dave, this quarter marked the -- I'll call it peak, where we have climbed up to what we believe to be a steady state. So I would expect where you've seen very nice incremental causals for our growth in the global platform almost every quarter for the last year, I doubt you will see that global growth rate going forward.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the follow-up on that then. If I take your guidance for business jet and regional jet OE growth, it looks like you're calling for sequentially things to get better from here. Is that just normal seasonality? Is there -- or is there something else contributing to that by the way of a new platform, or you're expecting some sort of recovery that's baked into your guidance?","Clayton M. Jones","I am absolutely expecting that the market will get better. We have long said, as you know, that we thought 2012 would be a better year and a recovery year. I am very confident now that, that will be the case. As we talked to all of our OEM customers, as you imagine we have, since they typically do calendar year to calendar year, I look at calendar year as the first year of growth in business aviation in the last 3 years after 3 years of decline. I think I can confidently say 2011, notwithstanding a world event, is it will be the low watermark. And I would say that, that growth rate for the business jet market at large, based on our conversations with customers, could be in the low-double digits with various OEMs with every OEM growing year-over-year from as low as, say, mid-single digits to as high as high-double digits. So I think what we have anticipated, which is a long downturn, pent-up demand, generally improving economic conditions around the world, especially in areas that have been impacted over the last 2 or 3 years is going to begin to reverse itself. And we should see the beginnings of a recovery in 2012.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Switching gears, 2 quick questions on the government side. First of all, how much did restructuring offset things or offset the decline in terms of volumes from a margin perspective? In other words, what would your decremental margins been on just the volume side x restructuring? And then the second question, in terms of the potential sequester, how do you deal with that from a planning perspective?","Patrick E. Allen","I'll take the question on the margins, and I'll give Clay the sequester question. As it relates to the impact of restructuring on the margins, I would say that I don't want to quantify the impact because we've been taking restructuring actions not only in the fourth quarter, but we've been doing a lot in the first quarter as well. And I think what we've been striving for all along, as we've talked about, even though in the face of revenue volatility, we want to have margin stability. And I think the Government Systems management team has done an excellent job of managing in an uncertain environment, and it's reflective not only of the restructuring that we took in the fourth quarter but all of the actions that have been taken over the course of the last 6 months.","Clayton M. Jones","David, relative to the sequester, I kind of plan for the sequester like you plan for the end of the world. Yes, I think about it. I hope it doesn't happen. I make sure I have my affairs in order, but I'm going to live my life every day. I think that the draconian nature of a sequester, it would be so damaging that the best we can do is just be prepared to react quickly, and that's kind of what we've had to do for the last 2 or 3 quarters. Certainly, that's something we think about. It probably impacts where we invest and how carefully we review our business planning. But at the end of the day, if sequestering were to happen, in all honesty, no human being on the face of the earth knows how that's actually going to even be implemented, even if it's sustained. Will it be an across-the-board cut? Will they -- will the DoD give authority to be more selective in it? I mean, all those things are so variable and so large that I just don't think it's reasonable. If I gave you how I was doing it, I'm not sure you ought to believe it because we just don't know what we're eventually going to have to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the discretionary spending trends that you're seeing from the airlines relative to kind of the break\/fix works at work, and is that even throughout all geographies or is U.S. slow, but Middle East, Asia are still active? Can you talk about that a little bit?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, when you say break\/fix, I think MRO. And I think the MRO is -- there's not much change in that. If it breaks, we fix it. It depends on what kind of contract we have with the airlines as to how we fix it, whether we give them an exchange, whether we just take it and return it or whether we're on a flat-hour basis for it. But my sense is the same thing that's driving that market is always driving that market. If it's an efficiency initiative, they're much more highly likely to do it. They look at their fleets and the aging of the fleets and what they're going to do with the airplane. And so I would say that there's nothing really new under the sun, I hate to answer that. It sounds very dull, but there's nothing new under the sun of the causals and conditions that are driving that either break\/fix aftermarket or the kind of retrofit aftermarket. The only difference I see is what I highlighted in the earlier question, and that is with these new entrants of aircraft, we're getting a great benefit as we expected by the initial sparing and how that's done. And that should sustain itself for quite some time because if I'm not mistaken, there are, however many, 30-plus airlines going to be taking 787s over the next several years. And every one of those airlines are going to have to make some kind of sparing decision. So that should be very good for us.","Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But from a geography standpoint, I mean, you're really not seeing a difference either?","Clayton M. Jones","Not really. I mean, obviously, the Asian airlines are growing faster and have newer fleets than the European airlines do and certain extent the North American airlines. And they react according to the age of their fleet and the health of their balance sheet. And you can kind of make intuitive judgments that there's actually less retrofit activity, less MRO activity in Asia because the fleets are newer. So most of that activity is in Europe and America, but they've got to keep the airplane flying, so they're going to repair the system. So again, those factors that make that thing drive have not changed.","Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just so I\u2019m clear, on the business jet market, when you're talking about kind of recovery, are you seeing the same trends between small, midsize and large jets? Or are you still seeing midsize recovering but smaller being kind of slower to recover?","Clayton M. Jones","I think the important thing here is now we're beginning to see the OEMs that produce small aircraft increase their production rates. Now remember, all the OEMs have airplanes of various sizes. So even the OEMs that are more focused in the lower end still have midsize airplanes as an example. So I think when you look at the market at large, what you're going to see is you'll see continued growth but not at the rate, maybe at the high end but continued growth, improving growth at the low end, but it will probably look like a higher rate because they've been beaten down so much. But the point is across the market, and we play across the market, so it's important to us, we're generally seeing OEMs saying they're going to be increasing their production rate in 2012. Now I would also say, which I didn't say, is I think this will probably be back-end loaded for the year. Remember, I said theirs is a calendar year planning phase; ours is a fiscal year, so that's the guidance we give. But I think you're going to see this build through the year as they load up the supply base and begin to ramp up their production lines. So I would say that this growth would be sort of back-end oriented.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Clay, I just wanted to follow up on that last question there on the biz jet market, particularly at the light end. There's been a lot of debate recently about whether or not it's realistic to think most of the light cabin OEs can have flat or higher production in '12, just given where their backlogs are relative to current production. Are you actually seeing or hearing or aware that they are having order activity improvement in the past handful of months? Or are you still -- or is this still based on them expecting orders to improve later in '12 to give you that back-end loaded growth?","Clayton M. Jones","I think the general activity has improved. I obviously don't have the degree of insight that the OEMs themselves have. But what I would say is my comments are based more on our conversations with OEM as they begin to align the supply chain for their production rates in 2012. It is logical to assume they wouldn't be telling us what their expectations are if there was not some sort of supporting activity to go with that. And anecdotally, I could sit there and tell you, yes, there are pockets of that supporting activities. But I think the thing that you have to really factor in here is the OEMs have worked very hard to manage that inventory they have so that there's not a lot of whitetails. We've gone through that. That they -- I think the used market has kind of gotten to where it's gotten. It's not -- we don't see a lot of improvement, but we see stability. I think pricing has begun to stabilize. We've seen that over the course of a long time. It's not great but it's stable. And now again, there's this pent-up demand of customers seeing opportunities to get back into the market for new aircraft and incrementally, they're doing that. Now remember, the basic production rates across business aviation is almost half what it was in 2007. And so if there's any kind of demand out there, there -- it is logical to assume that, that sort of pent-up demand and market stabilization should be occurring, and that's where we're seeing this relative growth. And in some cases, again I mentioned, you're going to see single-digit growth rates. In other cases where the aircraft are newer or they have more attractive selling features and points, you're going to see higher production rates.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. A quick follow-up on the aftermarket comments made earlier. When you said that retrofit activity was a little light, is any of that due to market share loss?","Clayton M. Jones","No. No. The retrofit activity is replacing a display or upgrading to a new information management system or things like that. And no, we haven't -- I don't think any of that, that I can define as market share loss. As I said, those programs tend to be very, very customer specific and timing specific. And I'll probably say it until they throw me in the grave, it's just lumpy. You can't count on it quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter but over a year, you can sort of begin to think where you're going to be and so we can forecast that generally over a year, but even that's the toughest thing we do. So I think that's what's at play here, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one last quick one for Patrick following up on the share repurchase question. Are you specifically saying you will not burn the rest of the authorization in '12? Or are you just saying you don't want to put a number to it right now?","Patrick E. Allen","I'm saying the latter. I don't want to put a number to it right now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it is possible that you do that?","Patrick E. Allen","Anything\u2019s possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Clay, if we could follow up on your comments on initial spares. Could you give us color with the first quarter abnormally high, and you said that it was kind of in line with your expectations on the 787 and yet All Nippon, the largest fleet operator, basically has chosen to go power by the hour?","Clayton M. Jones","That's correct, and we expected them to, Cai. As I said, we're not going to get every one of them right, but I would say over the decisions made so far and remember, some of the decisions have been made for future deliveries, not just for those that affected the first quarter, are generally in line with the splits that we expect of those that go power by the hour versus the initial sparing. And so what are the vagaries? Maybe not every airline is going as we've had this discussion with, but most have. We try to estimate what the amount of spares they'll need, some order slightly less, some order slightly more. But in general, I think it is in line with the decision points that they need to make at the time they need to make them and who's making what kind of decision.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a question for Patrick. The R&D in absolute terms was essentially flat. What do you expect company-funded R&D to do this year both in terms of absolute change and in terms of percent of sales?","Patrick E. Allen","I think we expect it to continue to be between 7% and 8% of sales. So I would say relatively flat as a percentage of sales.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So 7% and 8%, that's like basically 100 miles wide. I mean, can you narrow that a little bit?","Patrick E. Allen","I would say relatively consistent with last year as a percentage of sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on your comments, Clay, regarding the backlog in defense getting better. And I know you only reported annually, but obviously, the annual reports for fiscal '11 showed a mid-single digit decline in the funded backlog and kind of a double-digit decline in the total backlog for defense. As you look forward through this year, do you see that backlog in defense actually expanding and putting you in a position to grow into 2013?","Clayton M. Jones","I would -- here's what -- let me give my -- I probably -- maybe I confused you a little bit there, Myles, by my terminology. When you -- I think when you follow most defense companies, they actually report their backlog and they speak to the order fulfillment rate relative to that. And we, as you know, rarely do with specific numbers, and the reason is backlog, as we report it, to us is relatively unimportant because we'll win a $500 million program and the initial order we get is for $50 million, but we know that, that revenue is going to flow. What we use, especially when we're trying to project year-to-year, is what our firm versus anticipated sales are for the year. But typically, we'll go into any year at somewhere between, I'll say, 60% to 65% of our orders firm, and then we have to get the anticipated orders to close through the year. If you recall, third quarter of last fiscal year, one of the reasons that continuing resolution affected us so dramatically is that we could not get the DoD to move on those anticipated orders, and we were caught short in the second half of the year. That's also why having the continuing resolution threat behind us is important to us so now we can work on those anticipated orders. My comment was specifically relative to the progress we\u2019re making on filling anticipated orders for the balance of this year. That typically is done by new program pursuits that have sales related to them or existing programs that have follow-on activity that we know we get the contract order for and we convert that order to a firm order. And so my characterization is that flow is working pretty good so far and certainly much better than what we would have seen last year while we were under the specter of a CR. Now still a long way to go and although we're waiting on the '13 budget and the implications there, we think that the '12 budget is pretty firm, and now all we need to do is go about doing our business with our customers firming up those orders that we're anticipating. So that was the nature of my comment.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, I understand. And then I guess, since the last call, a few program decisions have been formally or informally made, C-130 AMP, JTRS GMR, a little bit of rhetoric on BSI on the [indiscernible] to display for the JSF. Any of those things we should be thinking about in terms of impacting growth in '12 and '13? Obviously, JTRS you had de-risked originally, but maybe even the offset to that is the program office looks at other commercial opportunities or RSIs, RPs for the JTRS solution, both the positive and the negative?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, the 3 programs you just mentioned there, Myles, I mean, I'll address those specifically. The JTRS GMR has been decided, and you're exactly right, we excluded that from our guidance and from our forecast for the year and, in fact, we even mentioned that as a causal, so that's a done deal. In terms of the helmet on the F-35, we're continuing to do work on that. We're under contract to do that, and good progress is being made. And so we expect no impact to that regardless of a F-35 rate decision that I know is hanging in the wind. Relative to the C-130 AMP, now that is in the rumor stage. We've heard those rumors as well. Nothing formally has been said by that. However, we're very well aware of a potential risk of that program either being reduced or eliminated. And I can tell you that the impact is relatively immaterial for the year. Certainly, well within the guidance we've given and is accommodatable.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last clarification was how large was job demand in the quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","A few million, less than 5 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Clay, just a follow-up on the government side. I was wondering if you could comment on whether you've seen any of your contractual terms of the customer getting a little bit tighter over the last 3 months or whether there's anything else in the works to that effect.","Clayton M. Jones","Not really, Rob, I think, certainly if you're considering the last 3 months. I think over the last year, I think it's become much more difficult to contract. I think that's a function of the lack of staffing in some cases, the lack of expertise in that staffing. I think the general budget environment has made everyone sort of pause as to what's going to happen next. So I think those general atmospherics have sort of been affecting us for now about a year and not just the last 3 months. I know that there -- we all know that there is a move in certain instances to be more preferential towards fixed price contracts. That really hasn't affected us because most of our contracts are fixed price already, so we've not seen that relative impact that I think the industry is seeing more of. And recently, there was this controversy on things like concurrency. But I think that was specific to some negotiations on the F-35. We certainly have not seen that trickle down to any of our contracts. So I would say, generally, the answer to your question is no. We've not seen any major shifts in defense contracting over the last 3 months.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on Myles's question really. It's sort of interesting that we've seen a number of programs perhaps being questioned more of their life expectancy and yet it appears your confidence in the second half with regard to the defense revenues has gone up. What would you say has been the major thing that has increased your confidence in the last 3 months?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I think it's several things. One is the fact that we're not operating under the continuing resolution as we did last year. That, as you know, was the source of probably half of our defense miss relative to guidance last year for reasons I've talked about at length. And so not having to deal with that uncertain condition is a big confidence booster. I think having now a budget in place and most of the negative impact already defined and behind us, just the relative order of uncertainty, I think, is less in 2012. Now in '13, it's a different matter because we haven't seen that budget and we haven't seen the manifestation of the Secretary's and the President's statement of a few weeks ago. And so we're still watchful of that. But I'll just call it a relative amount of uncertainty and our basic visibility into that. Now it doesn't mean something couldn't change. It's still a very dynamic environment, but all things in life are relative. And compared to the dynamics of the 6 months of last calendar year compared to where we are today, I feel relatively better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 3:42.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Clay, in -- or maybe it's Patrick, in Surface Solutions, the revenues were down like 43% in the quarter. And if I remember right, in September, your guidance was for that to be down low-double digit. So is it really possible to recover that much even though the comps do start to get easier when we get out in the third quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","We're certainly anticipating recovery in Surface Solutions. I think probably the biggest single thing is we're anticipating some fairly significant orders for our FireStorm product internationally, and that goes into Surface Solutions. That should provide some back-half growth to offset the first half weakness in that portfolio.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And then the commercial incremental margin, as you mentioned, Patrick, is over 40%. I mean, that's kind of what you've been guiding to. Does that change? Should we look for that to change any as we go through the year?","Patrick E. Allen","No. We've been saying 40% to 50%. I think you can continue to anticipate that. There will always be kind of onetime items that are going to impact it. But I think in general, 40% to 50% is a good baseline.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And then just one detailed one. The shares outstanding at the end of the quarter so I can properly model what I would expect for the second quarter.","Patrick E. Allen","If you hold on just a moment, I'll get that number for you. It's 146.7 million.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Okay. And then actually, maybe one for Clay. Clay, with the introduction of your new Avionics product, can you discuss any changes in terms of the competition with Garmin, which certainly looked like they were certainly gaining share with the Cessna product line?","Clayton M. Jones","I think it's about the same as I talked about last quarter, George. We're very confident the introduction of this new product is now going to get us into the game for that low-cost integrated product that Garmin has been very successful at moving into the market. And so now that we have a product that we can talk about and a time line when that's available, I think we're in much better shape than we were during this interim period, where we were entirely focused on the big fully integrated fusion program that we've also been successful on. So I would say that there are no significant change in dynamics either way since last we talked. But we feel really good about the discussions we've had about this product with our customers, and we'll see how that goes over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things. One is, Clay, R&D spend, as you pointed out, relatively stable. Where are you putting your emphasis in terms of new product and other items?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I think it's generally where you've seen us talk about in the past, Howard. Obviously, a lot of the commercial R&D is going into these new platforms that we are winning and the new products that go on those platforms. So heavy emphasis on Pro Line Fusion and then the Pro Line Fusion EDS that we just talked about at George's question, the investments that we're making on specific platforms that are coming out in the future, CSeries, A350, some of the regional, other regional -- international regional jets we've talked about, they're consuming a great deal of this R&D. I think on the commercial side there since beyond the A350, what we're talking about is a lot of our information management products. The Ascend product line that we're building out is a source of a lot of that research and development. And we are spending some R&D in the defense side on those areas that we know are going to be important. For example, it was mentioned earlier the -- whether the C-130 AMP goes or not, we have a very attractive product that's very low cost to upgrade C-130s around the world. Those C-130s are going to be here forever. And we think there's a very big market for that so we've invested in a product improvement and especially a cost improvement area in C-130s, which I think is going to help us a lot. We're investing in UAV products, which we think are going to be good. We're investing in networking products because I think that's going to remain a priority. So that gives you a sense.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And then Patrick, more on a financial question. I just wanted to make sure I heard what you talked about in terms of the second quarter appropriately. You talked about revenues being down 3% to 5% and a 25% tax rate. Is that correct?","Patrick E. Allen","You got both of those right, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Actually, it's Seth on for Joe this morning. Just had a quick question about the biz jet aftermarket. We've seen fairly weak flight ops data lately, not really much growth, kind of flat to maybe slightly down. And just wonder to what extent if at all that is a concern for you.","Clayton M. Jones","It's not an overriding concern. Our biz jet aftermarket is much smaller than our air transport aftermarket. And in fact, it was relatively slower of the aftermarkets this quarter, I think maybe reflective of that. But I think as long as they're flying the airplanes, we're going to get some of that business. The other thing that we look at that probably is below the floorboards of what you see in terms of fly activity is warranty roll-off. Remember, we go back about 5 years, and we know that the production rates are ramping up about 5 years ago as those aircraft are rolling off warranty and that gives us a little bit of upper as we look at this year and the next couple of years until we get to that sort of magic 2008 peak. But no, I feel okay about the relative sustainability of that aftermarket.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And just as a quick follow-up and sorry to beat a dead horse, but just to follow up on Rob's question. I know you get this a lot. Specifically, with regard to the government's attitude toward fixed-price commercial-type contracts, what kind of data they want to compel you to turn over. Has there been any change there over the past few months?","Clayton M. Jones","Again, I think not. Now there's always somebody in the DoD that wants to maybe push the rules and suggest that we ought to get them cost and pricing data. We saw that play out a little bit on the KC-46 contract a little bit. But we pushed back. That's not in accordance with the rules. And usually, after we have a good conversation of what's appropriate, we get to a good place. But that's not really new. I think that pressure\u2019s always been there because sometimes for people commercial-type contracting is a novelty. And the idea of being able to have the marketplace and competition set the price rather than have everybody prove that their prices are what they are is a bit of a culture change for some people. But we see no move at the senior levels of the Department of Defense, and that's what's the important one here, that would move away from the current federal acquisition regulations that allow for commercial-type contracting appropriately and their benefit. In fact, I would make the strong statement, and I think they understand this is as we're going into the environment we know we'll face the next 2 or 3 years, it is more imperative that you bring commercial companies in and use commercial-type contracting because you do not hear a lot of horror stories about commercial fixed price contracts because the risk is hedged, it controls behavior and, I think more importantly, it is the most efficient cost-effective way to contract in the Department of Defense. And I think they understand that. And I don't see any major policy changes that would erode those significant benefits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Clay, just a quick question on the biz jet OEM side and just trying to get a flavor for the nuance of these inquiries that you've been getting from the OEMs. Is this a case where they are just kind of pulsing the supply chain to make sure that if they needed to go up in rate, that the supply chain would be ready? Or are they actually saying, hey, we're getting ready to do this, we're getting all the ducks lined up here and we're going to get ready to go here, because it's an important subtlety and it'd be helpful for all of us to get a sense of what those conversations actually look like.","Clayton M. Jones","I don't think it's subtle at all, Jason. It's the latter, not the former. Typically, our biz jet customers set their rates about twice a year, one going into the calendar year, so that's the conversations and the data from which I'm making these statements. And then typically, in the summer, before they go into their typically August shutdown slowdown, which is traditional for most biz jet manufacturers, they'll relook at the year and reset the rates. And so these are very important points because they have a lot of people in the supply chain and a lot of long lead items and, therefore, these are 2 big important checkpoints along the year. And so as they go into the year, they want to make sure the supply base is ready to support them in the manner they want to. Now is that adjustable? I just suggested it was. So if they get into the year, it's not progressing as much, we know that they, in fact, do lower their rates. And what I would say is actually some of the OEMs we've talked to have lowered the rates slightly, maybe 2, 3, 4 here and there from what we would have expected 6 months ago. So in this readjustment, it can go both ways. But the information I gave you just a few minutes ago is aggregated across all of our customers in general what we see when we add it all up. We see a positive direction for the first time in 3 years of business jet production assuming it doesn't change mid-year and would certainly subject to some adjustment, but generally positive.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up to that last statement you made and just kind of assuming it doesn't change. From your perspective and your history in the industry, what are the key risks at this point that, that would change?","Clayton M. Jones","I think a significant downturn in the economy. Obviously, we're all watching Europe. If Europe implodes and that they move into a deep recession and that brings the world down with them, that will change all of our lives over the next 6 months. I think it would be something like that. But other than that, I think all the other economic contingencies out there are fairly well known. I think the thing you have to look at, the thing that drives business aviation as a leading indicator more than anything else is corporate profitability. And in general, I would say over the last year, corporate profitability has been very good, high and growing, and we anticipate that into this year as well. And so that's the most positive indicator. The second one we look at are more small business activity, general, I would say, capital expenditures that we see across a lot of industry because that's what this fits into. And again, cautiously, we're seeing the trend be better there. So it is not unexpected historically to suggest at some point it's going to recover, and we believe that's going to be 2011. We've believed that for a long time and now I can say it more confidently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Wedbush.","Kenneth Herbert - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a first question on -- within the commercial transport side, within original equipment, just about 8% growth in the quarter, how do you see that progressing through the rest of the fiscal year considering what you're hearing from your large customers there on the transport side in terms of their rate increases and expectations?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, as we think about it, year-over-year, Q1 was impacted by that $7 million incentive release. So actually if you adjust Q1 for that, the OEM growth in the air transport side was about 15%. Second quarter, we're expecting it to slow down a little bit. Not so much because of any weakness in the quarter, but the comparable from last year was a lot tougher because we had some very favorable, what we call BFE or selectable equipment mix on the air transport side. So think of that going down to probably high-single digits on the air transport side and then returning to double digits in the back half of the year.","Kenneth Herbert - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And if I think about this segment longer term, can you comment at all, Clay, in particular, on the conversations you're having specifically with Boeing about any incremental opportunities on the 737 MAX or a subsequent or follow-on to the 777 aircraft?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we always have conversations with our customers relative to technology product that we offer and what their plans are in terms of configuration of any new airplanes. We all know that there are 2 new -- 2 relatively variant narrowbodies coming in from both OEMs and then some potential for some widebody upgrades, which has gone -- has not been announced yet. I would hope that there could be the opportunity for incremental content depending on what those OEMs decide. And the only caution I would say right now, especially on the Neo and the MAX, is those are predominantly engine-upgrade programs. And I think those OEMs want to maintain a very low risk and focus on that, which is going to sell that new airplane. So it is unclear at this point what systems will be modified or improved to go along with that engine upgrade. And so I expect that decision to be made sometime before the end of calendar year 2012. We'll continue those discussions, hope that we can suggest a value proposition for that. But I really can't say any more than that because no decisions are, I think, imminent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can I just ask you about the cost reductions you talked about on the government side? Were those costs or period costs that you would have absorbed outside of the $0.11 that we saw on the December quarter? And would there -- would that have been material? You mentioned some cost reductions, I guess, in there and some of it was in the prior quarter in the charge and then perhaps going forward.","Patrick E. Allen","We've taken several actions. The largest one, of course, is the fourth quarter where we took the restructuring charge. But we've also continued to rightsize our workforce, and what I would say is the Government Systems management team has been very aggressive to try to manage to the lower volumes in the first half of the year. And they've managed really across the board, including discretionary spending. So they've been cutting. And I would say there are some costs associated with that, but they're buried in the results of the Government Systems business, and they're not significant.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Clay, last quarter, you had talked about a disconnect on the 787 production rates versus where Boeing was. Can you just give us an update on how close you are to perhaps getting in line? And then are there any other programs where there's a mismatch between where the OEM might be and where you're running right now?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, actually, thanks for the question, Sam, because there is new news there. If you recall, we exited the last fiscal year at a 2-per-month rate of production that we had been slowed down to by Boeing as we began to synchronize the very large inventories they had because we were shipping ahead of them and their production rates. I can tell you now that as a result of discussions we had with Boeing, that production rate is increasing as we speak and we should, by the mid to the end of this current quarter, be accelerating to about a 4-per-month rate. And our anticipation and the way we're discussing this is to hold this 4-per-month rate into our FY '13 until we get to that future point where that synchronization occurs. So we will not -- we will still not be in line exactly with where Boeing is, but we're sort of lead turning -- to use an old fighter pilot term -- lead turning a production rate that will get us to where we need to be. Now the reason we're doing this is we want to exercise our production rate to show that we can increase it so that makes sense, and we want to add stability to our production plan so we can make them efficient. And in the discussions we've had with Boeing, they understand that and therefore, you can expect us to be at a 4-per-month rate for the back half of this fiscal year. Now let me tell you the effect of that relative to revenues. It will basically have no material change in 787 revenues in the first half, and the reason for that is we started last year at a higher rate and it sort of wickered its way down through the middle of the year. So we're sort of passing in the night, if you will, by the end of the second quarter. By the third and fourth quarter, we should see improving 787 revenues for those last 2 quarters compared to the last 2 quarters of '11 when we were slower, if that gives you sort of a trend there.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just one last question is on the Government Systems and this question about the outlook improving. I guess, it sounds to me, and maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, is that you probably put some contingency into the remainder of the year for continuing resolution coming and lasting somewhat like last year and perhaps that's gone because outside of that and the F-15 finally getting booked, I'm trying to think about what else might have changed on the positive side.","Clayton M. Jones","Well, no. We actually didn't do that. If you recall, when we gave our guidance, we told you that the guidance did not include an extended continuing resolution. We thought we could manage through the first quarter. But beyond the first quarter, if there was another continuing resolution effect that, that would be a negative impact potentially. It actually turned out like we planned it to, which was the end of the first quarter. What I would say relative to that, Sam, is we did enter the year because of the uncertainty with a range of results. In a risk register, we assumed a lot of risks and we were looking as much as we could for what some opportunities were, and we've managed that risk and opportunity set to a point, and the closer we get to the finish line, obviously, the more confidence we're going to have that it will meet to where our guidance is. And I would say that my confidence is more our knowledge around those risks and opportunities, which I'm not going to go through every one of them with you, but we know what they are as we march our way through the year and ultimately close those orders anticipated that I mentioned earlier. That's the basis of my confidence. And let me be quick to say so that I don't sound overly confident, is in this environment, we really don't know when the next program impact or cancellation is going to be. So we fully understand that bad things can happen to good people. And so we've tried to include as much of that in this risk and opportunity profiling that we're watching, but that will continue to be the source of our confidence or a change in that confidence as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Leake with BB&T Capital Markets.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of clean-up items. The C-130 AMP and the F-35 helmet, do they both reside in Avionics, all of it?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","They do. So they're purely in Avionics?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Government Systems. On previously canceled Government Systems programs that were canceled for convenience, we had some COG. We were able to recoup some costs. Can you give us some progress on that? Was there a large amount in this quarter or at least where we sit on the recoupment of those costs in your assumptions for '12?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. What I would say is that the P&L impact of any cost recovery is going to be fairly small. We did record, I think, a small contract adjustment this quarter. By small, less than $2 million associated with one of those programs. And there will be some cash collections, hopefully, over the course of the year. However, the timing of those negotiations is difficult to predict.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. iForce, we haven't spoken about that in a while. Maybe some opportunities or what you're thinking on iForce?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we're still looking for those opportunities. As you all know, we had 2 very large customers, which we're still delivering some product to, although at a much lower rate. This is the California Highway Patrol and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. We're now looking at some of the smaller municipalities and looking for opportunities there. I would say it's slow going, although we do have some very modest sales planned in for, again, the back half of the year, where we are going to see some of that improved revenue that I talked about. But I'd say, it's a very small contributor at this point.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And last one. On the 787 rates that you talked about, the 4-per-month rate, and I'm not real clear on the disconnect that you're saying that, I guess, Boeing makes its 10 per month by year-end 2013. Can you reconcile sort of the 2 numbers? I mean, could you -- it doesn't mean that you couldn't quickly get to that number, but help me out understanding the 4 versus Boeing's 10-per-month rate at year-end 2013 for the 78?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we\u2019re fully aligned and know where Boeing is trying to get and how they're trying to get there at least currently. As many of you know that track that program, they have the schedules they call them and they constantly modify those schedules based on a lot of things that go on that we have no visibility into. And so every time they modify those schedules, it still gives them a track to get to what their stated output rate is, but maybe in a slightly different form. We fall in line with that. So I guess, the 2 things I would say, is we have visibility where they're going. They have, I think, a high degree of confidence we as a supplier can get there with them, but we need to do it in a way that accomplishes 2 goals: Make sure that they have enough inventory but not excessive inventory and where we have stability in our production rates. And so we're solving to that equation. And let me say this again, so don't look to our production rate as a surrogate for Boeing's production rate. If you're looking at that, you're going to -- you stay somewhere between confused or misinformed. But what I am trying to do is give you a sense of continuity from our perspective so you know what we're doing and the fact that now progress is being made. So to go from 2 to 4 is good, and so we're moving in that direction. Now where it synchronizes out in the future, we hope that will happen into our early '13 and then we can accelerate from there. The other thing I'd say is our ability to accelerate is I think far in excess of a lot of suppliers because of the nature of our product. So we know we can get there from here, but there's a lot of inventory on hand that we're managing to as well. That probably didn't help you a lot, but...","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","No, it helps. That's great. No, I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I wanted to ask about the Panorama Glass Front Projection. You made an announcement about it last night around Thanksgiving and about sim and training in general, which I don't think you've talked about a lot. I'm getting some sense that in the current budget environment, Pentagon has a bit more interest in sim and training as a means to save on cost. It could be a bit of a bright spot in an otherwise dismal defense budget. I wanted to get your sense of that if you could comment a bit on your outlook for the sim and training and your outlook for the Panorama GFP product. Do you think this could be, for example, a growth driver for Avionics sometime in the near future?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we think it is a growth driver. We're still forecasting simulation and training to grow for the year. So anything in defense that's growing is a growth driver by definition. And so I think simulation will do that this year. I think we're -- certainly, with that new product that you cited, we're trying to position ourselves to be more competitive, to offer more capability to customers so that we can continue to grow that product, and I have confidence that we can. Now that's based on a macro view that I think is logical, that as the budgets get more dear, as the OPTEMPO in Iraq and Afghanistan draws down, the ability to train pilots efficiently certainly lend themselves to doing very high fidelity simulation, which is much cheaper than training in an airplane, especially as you have fewer airplanes. We've seen that since time immemorial, especially with large really expensive airplanes like bombers, as well as now these new fifth generation fighters. So I think the conditions are lending themselves that simulation training is going to be good and now the issue becomes, can we offer the product and be competitive with the other offers to get hopefully more than our fair share. So I think that's our story.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just quick question, Clay. I guess, it's probably appropriate with a big picture question given all the details. Just regarding Government Systems on the international market from a net perspective, what are you seeing there? Are you seeing lots of opportunities or I mean, I think we have a good idea where the domestic budgets are going over the next 2 to 3 years as you mentioned, but how are you kind of positioning the company to take advantage of some of the growth you're seeing internationally?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, it's kind of playing out like we said it would and like we hoped it would, in that we have identified what we believe are higher-growth countries relative to defense spending. And we're seeing some of the growth that I talked about in my opening remarks happening in those countries, Saudi Arabia, the one I mentioned, and the F-15 sale, plus we're having some helicopter and other products going in under that same -- that's going to be very important to us. The Emirates, and they use the FireStorm, the latest customer of a number of international customers using this for their controlling targeting system that is, I think, an industry-leading system right now. In Brazil, they're building up their defense infrastructure. Our win on the KC-390, and there are a number of communication and commanding control programs that Brazil is looking at that we've targeted in that area. India. We've been very active in India, sorting through what the opportunities are there in communication and also Avionics upgrades, and we see opportunities there as well. So in those countries, which we know have growing defense budgets and defense needs because they live in bad neighborhoods and frankly, they are concerned now about the ability and willingness of the United States to come to their aid, we think that's going to continue to drive opportunities in our defense business for the last several years, and we have been positioning ourselves over the last 3 or 4 years to be a more forceful presence and a more value-creating supplier in all of those regions.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Are you seeing -- are you targeting like a specific sales percentage mix? We've seen some of the others, whether it's some of the prime contractors, kind of identify where they want to see their international sales mix. Are you approaching it that way? Is it more on a country-by-country basis?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, it's both. Obviously, we have country plans and specific opportunities that we track. The only thing we've disclosed publicly is that roughly 1\/3 of our sales right now for the whole corporation are outside the United States, and we would like that to be 40% by the year 2020. So that gives you a double-digit growth rate.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins\u2019 Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Sean, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins\u2019, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today\u2019s call is being webcast. And you can view the slides we\u2019ll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today\u2019s presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time-to-time in the company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we said that we expected first half of fiscal year 2016 to be a slow start to the year, followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be the weakest and in fact it was even a little weaker than we anticipated, most notably in Government Systems. So let me take that ahead on and summarize the performance and outlook of each of the businesses. And I\u2019ll start with our Government Systems business.","Due to program timing we expected our Government Systems business to be down mid single-digits in the first half followed by nice growth in the second half resulting in overall low single-digit growth for the year. In the first quarter, we did experience the anticipated headwinds that we outlined on last quarter\u2019s earnings call.","However, we were also impacted by two issues that we did not anticipate. One was a supplier issue that impacted late quarter deliveries of some products. And the other was a delay in some expected follow-on orders. All-in, the supplier issue and the order timing delay caused about 500-basis point impact to our Government Systems for the quarter. The good news is that we\u2019ve already resolved the supplier issue and we have booked one of the delayed orders. And I expect to recover both the order timing and product delivery catch up with in the year.","Now I know that it makes investors nervous when growth is back-end loaded, so I would like to provide some additional color on what we expect to drive that growth in our Government Systems\u2019 second half. Roughly 60% of the back-half growth is either in backlog or annual follow-on business where our customers make annual buys throughout the year. All this looks to be well-funded, so I don\u2019t see much risk here. But 25% of the second half growth is in programs that we have won, but are not yet awarded. The only risk is the timing of the contract action and we\u2019re tracking that very closely and are confident that will close in a timely manner for our year.","And then the last 15% of the second half growth are programs that we have yet to go out and win. And that number is inline with our normal, historical, anticipated sales profile for this point in year. So despite the challenging first quarter, I remain confident in our low single-digit growth for the full year in Government Systems.","Now before I move from Government Systems I do want to make a few comments about the budget outlook. First of all, the new budget is net good news for our government business. If you recall we\u2019ve been forecasting our government business with sequestration as the budget baseline. And as I\u2019m sure you know, the agreement is an improvement from that baseline. I also believe that we\u2019re well positioned to at least get our fair share of the budget increases, given their priorities and the breadth of our portfolio. I would expect that we\u2019ll start seeing some of this improvement as early as next year. In fact I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we get a little tailwind on short cycle orders by the end of this year. So this is a strong boost to our plan to return Government Systems to sustained growth.","Moving now to Commercial Systems, first-quarter results were inline with our expectations. OEM sales were down, primarily driven by the impact of the previously announced global express rate reductions at Bombardier. But we did see nice growth in our Commercial Systems aftermarket.","We delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, headlined by 22.2% operating margins and our Commercial Systems team did a really great job of controlling their spending to manage the margin impact from the Global 5000 and Global 6000 production cuts at Bombardier.","Fiscal 2016 is an important year of program execution for our Commercial Systems. And we completed a large number of milestones in the first quarter, including the certification to CSeries and ARJ-21 aircraft, first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, entry into service of the Challenger 650 at Bombardier, entry into service of the fusion-equipped King Air at Cessna, and entry into service of the Legacy 450 at Embraer. All of these programs are important in our long-term growth plan for our Commercial Systems business.","Now finally, let me turn to Information Management Services, where we delivered mid-single digit topline sales growth for the quarter and some really strong operating margin performance, a 130 basis point improvement over the year \u2013 over the prior year. Our core aviation business grew at 7% and continues to drive the incremental margin improvement that we expect from that business.","In the year, most \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, last year most of our revenue synergies from the business aviation side of the business were leveraging synergies between ARINCDirect services and Rockwell Collins international flight operation service portfolios. And while we anticipate some additional opportunities in this part of the business, we\u2019re now starting to see synergies in other areas of the business. For example, we\u2019ve secured a number of new agreements to fly Global Express connectivity service in the cabin, allowing us to address the broadband connectivity market that we have not previously served. We also signed launch customers for our ARINC MultiLink flight tracking service, which is complaint with the new European mandate that will help airlines keep track of their fleet.","I know I probably sound like a broken record, but I continue to be extremely pleased with the acquisition of ARINC from both a financial perspective and how well the culture of the ARINC team and the Rockwell Collins family. I think we continue to expect more good things to come from this business.","So in summary for the quarter, I feel really good about achieving our full-year plan. We have good line of sight to second-half growth, and we successfully executed our restructuring plan in the first quarter which will deliver benefit going forward. The permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and the 2015 government budget deal, are both very positive catalysts for Rockwell Collins\u2019 future. And I continue to believe with strong execution on new programs we have a very optimistic outlook for the long-term growth drivers of our company.","So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Patrick and have him walk through some financial details.","Patrick Allen","Thanks Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I\u2019d now like to walk you through today\u2019s presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I\u2019ll begin with Slide 3, where we highlight our total Company first-quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.","Total Company sales for the quarter decreased $57 million or 5%, compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations decreased $36 million or 21% and earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.26 or 21% compared to the same period last year. Income from continuing operations includes a $28 million after tax or $0.21 per share restructuring charge, primarily related to headcount actions across the company. Which we are taking as a result of challenging market conditions, particularly in business aviation. In addition, of both fiscal 2015 and 2016 includes our retroactive benefit from the federal R&D tax credit of $0.16 and $0.18 respectively.","As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $562 million for the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $18 million, or 5%, to $313 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, unfavourable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus A330 production rates. All of that was partially offset by higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Embraer Legacy business jet production ramps.","Aftermarket sales increased $17 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher head-up display retrofit sales in China, higher inorganic sales from the acquisitions of Pacific Avionics and International Communications Group and higher regulatory mandate sales.","Commercial Systems operating earnings were basically flat compared to last year with operating margins improving 20 basis points from 22% to 22.2%. Operating earnings and margin benefited from lower Company-funded research and development expense, partially offset by negative mix, as an increasing customer funded development offset lower business aviation product sales, as well as higher cost from the Pacific Avionics and ICG acquisitions and higher cost from further expansion in international emerging markets.","Now moving onto Slide 5, you\u2019ll see that we reclassified Government Systems sales categories into avionics, and communication and navigation. These sales categories have been consolidated from the previous categories to be consistent with an internal reorganization and are delineated based on the underlying product technologies.","Government Systems overall revenue decreased by 11% or $451 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, the timing of deliveries for the E-6 program, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program, lower stimulation and training sales, and lower international targeting system sales. Government Systems first quarter operating earnings decreased $20 million to $86 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1%, compared to 20.8% in the first quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from lower sales volume.","Turning to Slide 6, Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year, as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 7%, while the non-aviation-related businesses were flat compared to last year.","Information Management Services first quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $24 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4% compared to the 14.1% in the first quarter last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to incremental earnings and the higher sales volume.","Slide 7 provides an update of our R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $231 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $228 million in the first quarter 2016. Company-funded R&D decreased $17 million due to lower development expenditures for the Embraer Legacy 450 and Airbus A350, as well as lower business jet product line development costs.","Customer-funded research and development expense increased $5 million, due to higher development costs for international programs in Commercial Systems. And preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher cost incurred for certain military transport programs and government systems.","Moving to Slide 8, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter, compared to the end of last year. During the quarter our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.0x from 1.7x at year end. The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial paper, as the first quarter had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the first quarter we repurchased one million shares at an average cost of $87.40. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was about $290 million.","Now on to Slide 10, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as a result of the permanent reinstatement of federal R&D tax credit, as well as an updated restructuring charge. Total sales in segment operating margins remain unchanged from the previous guidance. The earnings per share range as been increased by $0.25.","The federal R&D tax credit provided about a $0.35 benefit to our fiscal year 2016 earnings per share guidance and is partially offset by higher restructuring expense and higher incentive compensation expense. The cash flow from operations range has been increased by $50 million, primarily due to the benefit of federal R&D tax credit. Fiscal 2016 guidance for research and development investment and capital expenditures remains unchanged.","Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, down from the previous guidance of about 28%, due again to the retroactive and prospective benefit from the federal R&D tax credit. The second quarter of the year will have an effective tax rate of above 30%, which includes the benefit that tax credit. And the third and fourth quarters will be similar to the second quarter, however, we expect some lumpiness to happen in the quarters, as a benefit from certain tax planning strategies is expected to be realized.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So, Ryan back to you to kick of the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the Q&A, we\u2019ll answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","David Strauss","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Patrick Allen","Good morning, David.","David Strauss","Kelly, maybe touch on business jet, business jet OE, how you're feeling about things. I think since you gave us guidance last time Dassault came out with some pretty weak numbers. Seems like all the indicators on the business jet side continue to weaken. Maybe talk about not only the guidance for this year, but you think the ability of the OEMs to hold at these lower production rates and not have to go down even lower from here. Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, David, if you recall we had put a little bit of discount in our forecast associated with anticipated further challenges to OEM production rates. What we normally have happen is \u2013 at this time of year all the OEMs really give us a trued-up forecast as to what they are going to do for the year. And in fact, we did see that production rate decline. Really we saw declines for most of the OEMs. And you\u2019ve heard, as you pointed out, you\u2019ve heard some weakness described in the market from those folks. In fact we\u2019ve used up the reserve that, I had allocated for that.","Now they typically hold pretty well through the fiscal year. If there\u2019s another adjustment, it usually comes around the summer furlough work time, time-off period. So we're hopeful that we're trued up for the year and that's why we put that discount there. Unfortunately, it isn't going to be opportunity; we needed that discount to reflect this.","As far as the long-term outlook, it still remains soft, David. And we continue to be fairly conservative in our outlook for business aviation. These rate levels are pretty low. I think they can be sustained, but we do need to continue to watch that market going forward. I don't have a better crystal ball for what production rates are going to look like next year. We'll true that up when we provide our guidance for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Yes, thank you. Good morning Kelly and Patrick.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Patrick, maybe you could remind us in terms of the cadence of how the savings kicks in for the rest of the year, just from a perspective on the EPS front and the restructuring.","Patrick Allen","Peter, I would say we realized very little savings from the restructuring in the first quarter. And I would say the savings is going to pretty much spread out evenly over the next three quarters. So we should see a pretty balanced savings profile over the next three quarters.","Peter Arment","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard Safran","Hi, good morning. ","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, very good morning. ","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Richard Safran","I wanted to ask you a question on the after-market and about Intertrade and demand you're seeing from refurbished parts. There are some indications of increasing demand for refurbished parts. Want to know if you can comment on that, what you're seeing there. Also, given that the inventory of aircraft cannibalized for refurbished parts is finite, just wondering if you're seeing improving demand, how long you might expect that to last.","Kelly Ortberg","Well, so our Intertrade business is seeing improved demand or increasing demand for used components. Richard, that's really not new; we saw that all through last year. We're expecting to be up double-digit in our Intertrade business this year. And I think that's a trend that's here to stay. So I think you just got to look at where that used components \u2013 it's going to be a function of what aircraft are being retired and the pace of retirement, and that's what's going to drive that market.","I think it's becoming a best practice in the industry. As I mentioned in the last call, we're seeing it now being used components. Recycling is being utilized in Asia-Pac where we typically they have always bought new spares in the past. So I think it's here to stay. That's why we've kind of factored our after-market to grow a little slower than what you're going to see the traffic grow. Because I think that after-market is going to be impacted by the recycling of the used components.","Now, luckily we have a used component business. Unfortunately, it's not quite big enough to offset the impact that we'll see in our overall MRO. But I think that's here to stay, Richard.","Richard Safran","Excellent.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord Genuity. You line is open.","Ken Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","Kelly, I wondered if I could start off \u2013 there\u2019s been obviously a lot of speculation with the announcement yesterday on the 747 cut from Boeing, just about health of the original equipment, commercial cycle. And I just wondered if I could get your thoughts on sort of if you see any incremental risk in the last month or so relative to some of your initial plans on either build rates on the 737, 787. Any particular incremental areas of risk you would highlight beyond what\u2019s been publicly announced? Or any updated thoughts on the sort of the OE outlook on the transport side here this year and into 2017. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Ken, really nothing new that I would highlight. I don\u2019t think the 747-8 rate change probably surprises any of us. Obviously, all eyes are on the basic 777 backlog and the ability of Boeing to sustain that. And we\u2019re still watching that just like you are. I\u2019ve got nothing to update you on that.","One thing I\u2019ve said is that Boeing would need to give us an updated rate forecast on the existing 777 here pretty soon to have any impact on our fiscal year 2016. And the fact that they came out with rate changes on 747-8 and didn\u2019t do that on 777 tells me that they\u2019re still marching to their plan to sustain the basic 777 rates, at least through the demand for our fiscal 2016. So nothing new really to report on that. Still very healthy backlog for us. And as you know, we\u2019ve got new share gain opportunities coming into the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Carter.","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick question on the aftermarket. When do you expect to see any material impact from A350 provisioning sales? Is that later this year kind of impact, or does it take fiscal 2017 to really see any material uptick there?","Kelly Ortberg","You\u2019re probably not going to spike out seeing material impact from A350 provisioning. We\u2019ve already seen initial provisioning and you really didn\u2019t see that as a major spike like we saw on 777. It\u2019s a little bit of a function of the commodities that we provide on the two different airplanes. They are different, as well as the fewer number of new airlines taking the A350 as opposed to 87 when it came out, had a lot of different airlines. I think, Carter, the next big provisioning spike for us is really 737 Max. And we\u2019ll start to see that maybe a little bit at the end of this year and certainly into next year, we\u2019ll see some good provisioning input for that.","Carter Copeland","Awesome. Thanks for the color, Kelly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Hi. Just want to know if you can talk just more about the aftermarket just in general. How much of the 8% overall, the 16% business jet aftermarket was organic versus acquired? Then can you just talk a little bit about the parts, the retrofits, the upgrades, the provisioning just in kind of the different buckets, how they all performed?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, if you kind of look overall, we were up 8% as we disclosed here. Air transport was up low single-digit. And that was really HUD retrofits, some cabin wireless activity. Mandates are down in air transport. We\u2019re going to see that throughout the year, that the mandate revenue is down there. Interesting enough, mandates overall were up, because mandates were very good for the quarter in business aviation. And finally, we saw a really nice quarter of avionics upgrades where they are putting fans, updates to the Biz Jet avionics. I\u2019m very hopeful but that will continue and actually provide us a little bit of opportunity for the full-year. In terms of inorganic revenue\u2026","Patrick Allen","It\u2019s about $8 million in the aftermarket and almost all of it is in air transport actually.","Kelly Ortberg","So Sam, if I kind of gave you a little bit of an outlook. I think we\u2019re going to increase our growth rate throughout the year in air transport. You\u2019re going to see the business aviation numbers mute a little bit. We\u2019re not going to see quite as high growth rate. But overall, we still feel good about that high single-digit growth in our aftermarket.","Sam Pearlstein","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. Good morning. Patrick, I guess historically, with the R&D tax credit, you guys would have a rate of about 30%. But as you said you\u2019ve implemented some tax saving strategies. When we think about going forward but baseline tax rate for you guys with the permanent R&D tax credit and perhaps some tax saving strategies that can be permanent as well, what kind of tax rates do you think about over a longer term?","Patrick Allen","I think over the longer term, Seth, we\u2019re looking at right around 30%. Maybe a little higher, but right around 30%.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Very good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard","Thanks very much, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Kelly, you mentioned on the government side about the potential positive impact of the FY2016 DOD budget. I was wondering if you could comment on what you are seeing in the defense export markets, whether there\u2019s been any impact has yet from the decline in the oil price.","Kelly Ortberg","No, none whatsoever. It\u2019s something we keep an eye on, but in fact all the priority funding, our Saudi F-15 program continues to be funded as expected. We\u2019ve got some follow-on business, high priority business in the Middle East in targeting and those all, all of those programs seem to be well funded. So, no, I\u2019m not seeing any \u2013 the oil issues seem to be playing through the commercial business much more than the defense business.","Robert Stallard","Yeah, that\u2019s correct, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Mr. Skibitski, your line is open.","Pete Skibitski","Sorry, good morning, guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Pete.","Pete Skibitski","Yes, guys there\u2019s been a couple questions on air transport aftermarket and I just wanted to get a little bit more color there. It looks like organically was down about 4.5% in the first quarter. And Kelly, you talked about kind of the new trends in that are going on there. So \u2013 but on a full-year basis, I think previously you were expecting kind of mid single-digit growth. Is this long-term now, more of kind of a very low single digits, 2%, 3% type of market for you guys, just because of the new trends there and maybe Asia weakness, Asia changes? Can you just add a little more color?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, I think the basic MRO component of the aftermarket you\u2019re probably about right because of that recycling that I talked about. But then we have the discretionary side that tends to be a little more lumpy. We\u2019ve got mandate driven revenue. We\u2019ve got these retrofits of head-up displays and head-down display systems on 757\/767. And then we have the provisioning things that we talked about earlier that tend to spike that. But I think if you strip the discretionary away and look at the fundamental MRO, I think you\u2019re probably about right.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Okay. And then just any incremental headwinds at all from Asia, given some of the volatility over there?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, we have seen a little bit of incremental headwinds in our flight services business in IMS, where we\u2019re doing international trip support. If you look at our growth rate, it was just a little lower than what we\u2019ve been expecting and almost all of that softness is just international trips. In fact, our international trips for the quarter were down about 6%. We\u2019re gaining customers, but they are flying fewer international legs right now and I think the China, Russia and Brazil are the areas I would spike out that are causing that. Hopefully that stabilizes here going forward.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Myles Walton","I was hoping you could touch on the government side. And I know you want to give quarterly guidance, but how quickly can you recover in 2Q back to that down mid single-digit trends you had originally thought about? Are you at a point where you\u2019re kind of back on the recovery profile, or is 2Q trends going to look similar to 1Q?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, so let me talk about that. First of all, it\u2019s unfortunate that, and disappointing that we had these issues that kind of piled on a soft quarter. The product issue, if it had been any other quarter than the holiday quarter, I think we would have had it resolved and wouldn\u2019t have even had to talk to you about it. So we\u2019ve already got the issues resolved with the customers. We\u2019re making the deliveries. So that will go pretty quickly. We\u2019ve booked one of the major orders that were the Pakistan\u2019s C-130 that we anticipated. So that will move forward. So I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll be able to recover that in the fiscal year. Maybe not all in the second quarter, but certainly by the end of the year. So we\u2019re still kind of forecasting down mid single-digits for the first half and then growth in the second half.","Myles Walton","Okay, and then just one other, of the dime, Patrick, that you mentioned was being absorbed by higher incentive comp and extra restructuring, how much is extra restructuring of that and where is it going?","Patrick Allen","Think of it as about half and half. And the increase is largely in the voluntary retirement program, which is spread across the businesses.","Myles Walton","Okay. All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, good morning everybody. Hopefully, you can hear me.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning. We can.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Robert Spingarn","Kelly, I wanted to go back to ARINC and just ask if you could give us a little more of a window into actually, into what\u2019s going on in that business. Maybe separate the aviation from the non-aviation, and talk about how you\u2019re going to get that higher single-digit growth rate later in the year, and maybe also if you could comment on the relative profitability of the different businesses in there, because it seems like the non-aviation is the lower margin business.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, it is. And if you look really the economic engine as I mentioned, the incremental margin comes from the growth in the core aviation business. The non-aviation business, we called that lumpy in the past, where we\u2019ve tended to have project-oriented programs. I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s been consistently lumpy down. So if you look at the performance of that business been pretty flat. And it was flat this quarter. I am expecting growth in the non-aviation component of the business. So we\u2019ll see an improved overall growth rate.","And we put some strategies in place to address the growth in that business. So I think this is going to be an important year to see whether those strategies are going to play out. But we are achieving our overall EBITDA growth expectations because of the fact that we are achieving the core aviation growth that we expect and that we are achieving or a little bit exceeding the incremental margin performance that\u2019s coming with that growth. So again, I feel pretty good about it. The only, the only headwind that I see that maybe we didn\u2019t anticipate was this international trip support. I think that\u2019s temporary for us and we\u2019ll be back, with the growth in international trips, but we\u2019re just kind of have to work through the economic issues here that we\u2019ve got in those regions.","Robert Spingarn","So would you say that Q1 was below plan?","Kelly Ortberg","Little bit, yes.","Patrick Allen","Yes. Q1 was maybe a point below what I was expecting.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. But you still feel pretty good about your original guide?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, I do.","Patrick Allen","Yes.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","And just to be clear, where it was below plan was in the non-aviation business and\u2026","Robert Spingarn","Right.","Kelly Ortberg","And it\u2019s really the timing of some deliveries there.","Robert Spingarn","I guess the question is can the aviation make up for that or can the non-aviation make up for that?","Patrick Allen","Well, look we\u2019ve been able to make up for it from a profit perspective by driving the growth in the aviation. We have got to get this non-aviation business off this flat forecast, and that\u2019s the strategies that team, my team knows that very well. I think we\u2019ve got some plans to do that. If we can just get some average growth of the non-aviation and continue with that really strong growth out of the aviation business, I feel really good about achieving our long-term outlooks.","Robert Spingarn","Right, right. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks.","Operator","Your nextquestion comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much, guys. So you\u2019ve raised your EPS guidance by $0.25. I think the R&D tax credit is plus 30 and you had mentioned on the negative side, the restructuring and incentive comp and then my understanding was the restructuring savings in the last nine months would at least equal the first quarter\u2019s charge. And then I guess I don\u2019t understand why the incentive comp is up when you missed your plan in the first quarter. So if you could explain those issues. Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Sure, Cai. Yes, I would say both the restructuring charge and the savings are up from our original estimate. I would say the charge is up a little bit more because we\u2019ve got \u2013 we have some need to backfill some of the people who took the voluntary retirement program. So it\u2019s really a disparity between the size of the charge and the size of the savings that\u2019s generating what\u2019s roughly a nickel of headwind to the R&D tax credit. And the impact on incentive compensation, if you remember last time we had a big catch up in R&D, we had EPS as a goal in incentive compensation. We took that out, but we still have a goal associated with cash flow and the R&D tax credit generated incremental cash flow, which is generating higher incentive compensation because we\u2019ve raised our cash flow goal by $50 million. So that\u2019s the other component of the, I\u2019ll say roughly dime that\u2019s offsetting the $0.35 benefit in R&D tax credit.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George Shapiro","Yes. If I look at the commercial margin ex-R&D, since it clearly benefited, it was dropped to 170 basis points from 30.1% to 28.4%. Now, you mentioned that you had a little impact with higher low margin customer-funded, higher costs from the Pacific Avionics. So my question is, will R&D stay at this lower level throughout the year? Or are there other \u2013 some of those other issues I just mentioned one-time items or what\u2019s going on to effectively cause 170 basis points drop in the underlying margin? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","George, I think your math is spot-on. And I think you\u2019ve identified the causes of why the margin has been impacted in the first quarter. Now, what\u2019s going to happen going forward is we\u2019re going to see I\u2019ll say a steady shift between company-funded R&D going up and our deferred engineering investment coming down over the course of the quarters. Now, that\u2019s going to be offset by restructuring savings, which as I mentioned earlier in the call, we didn\u2019t get much of any in the first quarter. So we\u2019ll be benefiting from the restructuring savings, plus, we should be getting higher volume and with higher volume getting the incremental flow on that. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to generate good margins on the commercial side of the business. But the dynamics will be as I described.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak form Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Allen","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Wanted to go back to the Government systems growth rate in the quarter. With the supplier quality issue, any incremental detail you can provide on exactly what that was or where it was? And then on the order timing, which sounds like a separate issue, somebody else in defense has brought up the holidays. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if there was a system-wide abnormal end of year issue. And can you quantify what the growth rate would have been in the business without these sort of transitory items?","Patrick Allen","Yes, it was about five points of impact to our Government systems growth rate. So we\u2019re down 11% we would have been down 6% without them. The supplier issue was a nonconforming material issue on a connector that we used in our ARC-210 radio. In fact, we didn\u2019t have to rework. We just needed to go through the quality paperwork and get a waiver in place. Unfortunately, that was at the end of the year and with the holidays, we couldn\u2019t get that waiver approved. So we\u2019ve got that waiver now approved. The products are shipping. So it really was just a blip. You shouldn\u2019t think of that as any kind of systemic issue.","In terms of the order timing, the one that I highlighted, the Pakistan\u2019s C-130, we had expected quite early in the fiscal quarter. We actually got that here early this calendar year but it delayed. And that\u2019s an FMS order. I don\u2019t think that was holiday-related, Noah. I think that was just the normal challenge we have of trying to predict how fast things go through that cycle. I don\u2019t have anything else to highlight in Government systems that was abnormal around the holiday.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And your short cycle defense comment, was that a change? Had that started to firm? And then has maybe turned a little bit? Or is there no change in how you\u2019re seeing that progressing?","Patrick Allen","No, no change\u2026","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Patrick Allen","Short cycle things like radios, munitions, are the types of things we would expect to see. NRE programs would be example, the things that we\u2019ll see out of the benefit of this budget update. And so there\u2019s no change in outlook there.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Kelly, just to stay on the Government system, specifically, I think you called out 15% of the back half that you need to go out, get and win. Can you give us some color? Is there a lot of FMS sales in there and maybe on the \u2013 also on the FMS topic? Can you touch on any risks related to the KC-390 program, given the kind of current state of the economy in Brazil?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, so let me walk through each of those categories that I went through. For those of you who are program-specific in government, you\u2019ll understand what programs are driving that. So I talked about 60% being firm in follow-on. If you look at the firm contracts, KC-390, KC-46 some rotary wing at AgustaWestland and Sikorsky, Saudi F-15 are all firm programs that have first half\/second half growth. I\u2019m confident that the KC-390 first half\/second half growth will be achieved in spite of the economic situation. We are funded by Embraer.","It doesn\u2019t mean they are necessarily funded by their customer, but they are going forward with that. I do think we will probably see some future delays on the KC-390 program. But at this point, nothing in this fiscal year. Then in that, I also talk about follow-on in that 60%. And these are our annual buys, things like the R210, mid data links, our KC-135 Block 45 program, where the customer buys the annual work on a yearly basis. They are all funded, they are in the plan and I don\u2019t see really any risk there.","The 15% that I talked about is really \u2013 there\u2019s no real large program drivers. Some of them are international. These are things we\u2019ve either bid on or we\u2019re waiting a decision. And we also have quite a bit of just short cycle stuff, where we get an order and sell it out of finished goods. And so we just track that kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of little orders. We track that relative to how do we look firm this year versus historical. And we look pretty good with improving budget environment that maybe actually opportunity for us. But I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s out of the normal, nor do I see any major one program driver in that 15%.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Very helpful. Thank guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky","Yes, good morning, thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Jason Gursky","I just wanted to stick with Government Systems. One last question here. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are expecting some level of annual renewals that kind of come through. But one of the things we\u2019ve heard from others is that the annual renewals are beginning to get descoped in size. And so, the government buys 100 one year and buys only 96 or 95 the following year. Can you just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing on your annual renewals and whether there\u2019s been any descope occurring for you guys?","Kelly Ortberg","I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say across the board descope, I think it depends on what \u2013 we do see some descope but we also see some increase in scope. Our JDAM orders are higher than what we expected. We always look at the quantities on the KC-135 Block 45, but that\u2019s more driven by the pace at which the government can take the kits and get the aircraft modified. So we are always dealing with that, but nothing systemic or nothing that I would expect would be across the board and cause us any challenges. Radio quantities, MIDS quantities for tactical data links, all look good going forward. So nothing that I\u2019d be able to say we see that trend.","Jason Gursky","Okay. Then just a clarification question, if I can. On the IMS comment around international flight operations being under a little bit of pressure, can you let us know whether that was for commercial flights or bizjet flights or just kind of what the mix of that weakness is? Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, that \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s all business aviation. This is where we do trips \u2013 international trip support. So when a business aircraft makes an international trip, we provide a service to them for that trip, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the weakness, has nothing to do with air transport.","Jason Gursky","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies and Company. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. I want to talk about implementation for a moment. You\u2019ve got a lot of things that are going on this year, Kelly. And maybe you could address a couple of things, how you are doing in terms of implementing this restructuring program. I mean, you did make a change to the government business unit, the 737 MAX is at the critical point before first flight and you have to balance, what I call cert requirements and production rate. And then you\u2019ve got C Series. And then just to finish on that is the change in the global and weather, in fact you feel like you\u2019ve understand the depth and the magnitude of that challenge.","Kelly Ortberg","Well, Okay, lot in that question. So first of all, I think the restructuring has gone very well. It\u2019s mainly a headcount reduction for us and that has all went out in the first quarter. So, I\u2019m very pleased with where we are. We do have some consolidation and restructuring of our business to run more efficiently with fewer heads and that\u2019s what drove, for example, the change that we made in our Government Systems portfolio.","Our development programs are going very well. We\u2019re in great shape on MAX. I\u2019m very excited about the support and getting that aircraft into first flight and everything looks really good. So development programs are tracking quite well. I mentioned the C Series certification. Now our team\u2019s focused with supporting Bombardier to get to entry into service here, middle of the year. As far as business aviation and the Globals, we saw global impact. As I mentioned this quarter, that impact actually increases a little bit throughout the year. That was an area that we saw some additional truing up from Bombardier here as we went into the fiscal year. So, yes, I think that we\u2019re going to just be challenged with that production rate, but I think we\u2019ve got it well-sized now for the year.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Thanks again. Kelly, you had mentioned the upside from the fiscal 2016 budget. Wanted to see if you would care to speculate what that could mean or Government Systems growth looking out 2017, 2018, 2019, I think you previously said getting back to 2%, 3% kind of growth rate? Could you maybe talk about the kind of upside we could see from the 2016 budget out in those years? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Well, so the team\u2019s still kind of going through the actual program pedes and how that all is going to flow. But I would hope that we\u2019ll see a point or two of higher growth than we had previously had anticipated because that\u2019s what we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing out of this budget environment. And again, I think we\u2019re pretty well positioned to at least get our fair share. So, it\u2019s long-term, I think it certainly firms up our ability to get this business back to low to mid single-digit growth.","David Strauss","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Hi. Patrick, can you just talk a little bit about the pre-production engineering. With a $40 million increase, I guess in the first quarter you talked about $100 million for the year. I guess, are you still seeing that kind of an increase? And does that mean it increases more earlier in the year and then it starts to actually reverse? Or is it just\u2026","Patrick Allen","Yes, yes. I would say, yes. What we\u2019re going to see is over the course of the year, the amount that goes into the deferral going to reduce over time. And actually I think I mentioned it with George\u2019s question, you\u2019re going to see company-funded pick up a little bit, company-funded R&D pick up a little bit over the course of the quarter. So you\u2019re going to see a little bit of a mix shift over the course of the year. And we still \u2013 and we\u2019re on plan with respect to deferred. So I still feel very, very comfortable with that $100 million net increase.","Sam Pearlstein","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and thanks for taking the follow-up. Just if we could go back to the commercial aftermarket and you could talk maybe a little bit more about Intertrade. And you\u2019ve talked for a while about the structural factors driving growth there, but just from a cyclical standpoint with low oil prices \u2013 a lot of the data that we all have seen shows retirements were down last year, in terms of the \u2013 in a environment, maybe we\u2019re not as many aircraft are being retired and maybe older aircraft are flying a little bit more. How does that cyclical dynamic affect Intertrade and play out against the structural dynamic of more airlines looking to harvest used parts?","Kelly Ortberg","I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think I can point to exactly how much that dynamic would change our Intertrade business. It\u2019s all \u2013 the focus of that business is all around making sure you have the right demand for the right asset, and you go buy the right asset that you can turn. And so it really gets down to a program-by-program, aircraft type by aircraft type, a specific dynamic that team works.","In the end, whether they slow the \u2013 if they slow the retirement rate, that will mean that there\u2019s probably fewer spares out there. But it also mean there\u2019s probably larger demand for those spares, those used spares. So the trick will be our ability to get to those used parts in the market to continue to grow. And I feel pretty confident that within the business that we\u2019re forecasting, we should be able to grow that, again, double-digit here for the year.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","Yes. Just wanted to pursue a little bit more, the business jet aftermarket is up 17%. You were saying that the inorganic was all air transport. So what do you look for business jet aftermarket going forward? I mean, last year, I guess it\u2019s a pretty easy comp, but still \u2013 that\u2019s a pretty healthy increase.","Patrick Allen","Well, remember, we\u2019ve guided that bizjet aftermarket would be fairly new to \u2013 kind of like what we saw last year. Obviously, 17% is the gangbuster start to \u2013 I think we saw 2% last year in growth. I don\u2019t \u2013 as I mentioned, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to continue at that 17% rate because some of the mandate activities will come down in business aviation. But I\u2019m hopeful that if we continue to see like we\u2019ve seen this quarter with good sales of avionics mods that we\u2019ll be able to create some opportunity to our forecast there.","George Shapiro","And Kelly, I don\u2019t know whether you want to forecast or not, but would \u2013 based on everything you said with second quarter revenues again be lower than last year\u2019s second quarter? Like the first quarter was lower than last year\u2019s first quarter?","Kelly Ortberg","I think it will be much closer to flat, but yes, maybe down a little bit.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, just a follow-up on the comment on the ARINC and the bizjet softness there, if that\u2019s the right characterization. Was that from the service demand or was it from the volume of flights?","Kelly Ortberg","It was from the volume of flights which drives the demand for the services. If you think about that, we get paid to provide trip support for our flight if they don\u2019t take that flight. And by the way it\u2019s by leg. So even if they take a flight, but it\u2019s fewer legs, that means less revenue for us, the more trips, the more legs to the trip, the higher the revenue.","Robert Spingarn","So this non-discretionary service, this isn\u2019t something that they select by flight. This is just tied to the number of trips, as you just said?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Generally, anybody who is flying a large bizjet like that has contracted with the flight support services organization or they may do some of it themselves. But it\u2019s things they have to do to support that flight.","Robert Spingarn","So you\u2019re just tying that to George\u2019s question on strong aftermarket in biz jet. I mean, we actually seeing a flight activity decline here that\u2019s worrisome?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, that\u2019s a very small segment. I think if you look at bizjet, overall flight activity\u2026","Patrick Allen","It was up low single-digit growth. And if you look at our commercial MRO, it tracks very closely to that overall flight activity. So, yes, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we watch that very carefully. We\u2019ve been \u2013 we saw low single-digit in our bizjet MRO here this quarter. And that tracks pretty close to that activity. If the activity ticks up, our revenues will tick up. If the activity slows down, we\u2019ll see headwinds.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just switching gears slightly, commercial OE, last \u2013 I don\u2019t know, year or so, you\u2019ve had sort of this \u2013 on the air transport side, but $180 million to call it $210 million quarterly sales. But of course, you talked earlier about all this new \u2013 these new programs that you\u2019ve won MAX, 777X, A350 so on. When should we start to see that quarterly number really start to move north?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, we\u2019ll seeing this\u2026","Patrick Allen","What we planned is\u2026","Kelly Ortberg","In the second half of this year, we\u2019ll see the production rate increases for \u2013 at Airbus for the narrow bodies and we\u2019re seeing A350 consistently ramp up. We will start to see some revenues very late in the fiscal year on MAX, but really it \u2013 really ticks up in fiscal 2017.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And you\u2019ll get the seven, eight benefit at some point here.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Robert Spingarn","Are you already running that at 12?","Kelly Ortberg","No, I think that starts to hit us in our second half?","Patrick Allen","Yes.","Kelly Ortberg","Second half of the year is where we will see the benefit from 87 along with the 320s.","Robert Spingarn","So it sounds like that June or September quarter we could see a meaningful move in that commercial OE air transport figure?","Patrick Allen","You should see much better growth in the second half of the year in air transport OE.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, thank you.","Patrick Allen","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies and Company. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Well, thank you very much. China Aviation has been a very important driver for the \u2013 for your business for quite a while and there is sort of two parts. So one is you articulated the HUD pickup. But also from time to time those carriers also adjust their spares and their demand and other things and then last, growth has been pretty good. And also related you\u2019ve had some R&D programs in there. So Kelly, could you kind of address the market and talk about \u2013 provide some color please?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, the market demand for our services for our products and for the aircraft continuous to be very strong. Where we are seeing weakness is the overall things that are related to the economic slowdown, things like flight activity as an example. But I\u2019m not seeing any softness in their demand for aircraft, number of flights they are doing in the air transport market. The aftermarket remains very robust. They are continuing to fund HUD retrofits to meet their mandated service. So, yes, the overall economy is slowing down, but I think it\u2019s still a very robust market for air transport.","Howard Rubel","So you can still see varying anywhere from mid to high to even low double-digit growth? Is that fair?","Kelly Ortberg","In \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in what segment.","Howard Rubel","Well, I mean if you were to characterize it, it still probably ranges somewhere between mid or high single-digit to maybe even low double-digit. Is that correct?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. For our China business if I put all in, yes, I mean, I don\u2019t have the number in front of me, Howard. But I\u2019d say that\u2019s a double-digit growth business and continues to grow at that rate.","Howard Rubel","No, that\u2019s kind of the read I have and I just\u2026","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Howard Rubel","You see it and touch it more than I do. So thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Sean. We plan to file our 10-Q later today. So please review that document for additional disclosures. Thank you for joining us and participating on today\u2019s conference call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Denise and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today\u2019s call is being webcast and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today\u2019s presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide two of this webcast presentation and from time-to-time in the company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Well, as you know this will be the last quarter we report without the results of the newly acquired B\/E Aerospace and I'm pleased that we go into the merger with our legacy businesses performing very well.","We delivered another quarter of solid operating performance highlighted by 30 basis points of total segment operating margin improvement. Strong growth from our Information Management Services, Air Transport and Government Systems businesses was partially offset by expected headwinds from lower business jet OEM production. If you'll recall, this is pretty much what we forecasted in our initial guidance. So, through the first half of the year, fiscal 2017 is playing out about as we expected.","Now, before I talk about B\/E Aerospace and the acquisition, let me first provide a quick update on each of our businesses, and I'll start with Government Systems, which is now becoming a steady-growth engine for our company. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of at least 5% sales growth.","In addition, our Government Systems business has been able to maintain very strong margins while continuing to invest in new development programs and pursue new opportunities that are expected to continue to drive growth.","A great example of one of these new opportunities is our award for the Tactical Combat Training System program, or TCTS, which we just announced a few weeks ago. TCTS will provide an advanced airborne, ground and ship-based encryption training capability for the U.S. Navy. It builds on our successful CRIIS test and evaluation instrumentation program.","And these two programs now allow us to address both the test and training range markets as we go forward through upgrades to support fifth-generation fighter aircraft. And this is a market we just haven't previously addressed and is a good example of how we're applying our capabilities in new ways to capture opportunities in this improving defense market.","In the near-term, we're all focused on what happens with the fiscal year 2017 appropriations when the CR expires at the end of the month. And with the current continuing resolution, we've already realized about $30 million of impact to sales for the year.","And if it were to extend through the full fiscal year, I think that impact would more than double. With that said, with or without an extended continuing resolution, I still expect low to mid-single-digit growth in our Government Systems business in fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to Commercial Systems, sales are playing out about as we expected when we set our original guidance back in October. As a reminder, we thought we'd be down a little in the first half and up a little in the second half. And for the full year, we're expecting sales to be about flat.","On the OEM front, Air Transport continues to be strong, and we expect that strength will continue over the balance of the year as the A350 rates ramp, Boeing and Airbus continue to ramp up their narrow-body rates and our share gains on the 737 MAX begin to kick in.","In Business Aviation, OEM sales continue to be weak, as expected. In the Commercial Systems aftermarket, ADS-B mandates are picking up, and the Bizjet and cockpit retrofits are actually a little stronger than I expected. We continue to anticipate aftermarket to strengthen over the second half of the year.","Moving now to Information Management Services, this was another strong quarter, with operating margins of almost 20% and 13% topline sales growth. I remain very optimistic about our ability to capture this growing market opportunity driven by the connected airplane.","So, in summary, looking at our base Rockwell Collins business, there's no doubt that we have some nice momentum as we enter the new chapter for our company with the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace.","As you know, we had overwhelming support from both Rockwell Collins and B\/E shareowners as they approved the merger. We also cleared all of the regulatory reviews with no provisos. And we successfully funded the acquisition while still maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. And we're able to close the deal right when we thought we would when we announced it last October.","Last week, we had a great first day with the B\/E employees. There's lots of excitement across the Board and I'm very pleased to have such a wealth of talent joining our team. As I've reported, we've had integration teams planning, working and hand-in-hand for the last several months, focused on our synergy plan. And I still feel very confident we'll achieve the $160 million in run rate cost synergies.","And remember, 90% of those are expected to be in place by the end of our fiscal 2019. In fact, we've taken on an internal stretch goal of $200 million in run rate cost synergies and we are identifying opportunities beyond the original target. So, things continue to look really good there. And we now can start sharing the details that were somewhat limited pre-close.","Today, we're providing updated financial guidance for fiscal 2017, including B\/E Aerospace, which will operate as a separate segment within Rockwell Collins called Interior Systems.","The business will continue to be led by Werner Lieberherr, B\/E's former CEO. The updated financial guidance includes higher GAAP sales, cash flow and a higher adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. And Patrick's going to walk us through the details of that revised guidance in his prepared remarks.","Looking now to the future, I'm excited about the growth potential of our new combined company. As our integration teams are working together to achieve our synergy plans, new ideas and best practices are coming to light that make one thing very clear, both companies are very high-performing businesses and I'm confident that we're going to create value that would not have been realized separately.","To that end, we're planning a Investor Day this fall to provide you more insight to our longer term plans and the outlook for our business. And we'll let you know the specific date and logistics as we get those firmed up here.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick and have him walk us through the financial.","Patrick Allen","Thanks Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like you to walk through today's presentation slides that summarize the results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. I'll begin on slide three where we highlight our total company second quarter sales, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and diluted average shares outstanding.","Total company sales for the quarter increased $31 million or 2% compared to the second quarter of last year due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales, partially offset by lower Commercial Systems sales.","Income from continuing operations was $168 million and earnings per share was $1.27 in the second quarter of the current year compared with income from continuing operations of $172 million and earnings per share of $1.30 in the same period last year.","Excluding $0.07 of acquisition-related expenses from the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace in the second quarter of the current year, earnings per share increased $0.04 or 3% compared to the same period last year.","As we turn to slide four, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $594 million in the second quarter, down 3% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $16 million or 5% to $337 million, primarily due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, partially offset by higher product deliveries in support of Airbus A350 rate increases and favorable customer timing for airline-selectable equipment.","Aftermarket sales decreased $5 million or 2% due to higher regulatory mandate sales, partially offset by lower spares provisioning for Boeing 787 aircraft.","Commercial Systems operating earnings were $132 million and operating margin improved 10 basis points to 22.2%. Commercial Systems was able to expand margins despite lower sales volume and higher company-funded research and development expense due to cost savings initiatives.","Moving to slide five, Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $565 million. Second quarter Avionics sales increased 3% over the prior year, driven by higher simulation and training program revenues and higher fixed-wing development program sales, partially offset by the wind down of the legacy tanker hardware deliveries. Communication and Navigation sales increased 9% over the prior year due to higher data link program sales and higher deliveries of GPS-related products.","Government Systems second quarter operating earnings increased $6 million to $114 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.2%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of the prior year.","The increased operating earnings and operating margin were due to higher sales volume and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of higher development program sales.","Turning to slide six, Information Management Services sales increased 13% over the prior year. IMS sales increased due to double-digit sales growth in aviation-related revenues, driven by increased use of connectivity services and the timing of certain equipment deliveries. In addition, non-aviation revenues increased double-digits as well due primarily to higher equipment sales for nuclear security programs.","Information Management Services second quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $36 million, resulting in an operating margin of 19.7% compared to 17.9% in the second quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due primarily to higher sales volume.","Looking next to slide seven, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $1 million of operating cash flow compared to $45 million last year. The decrease in cash generation was due primarily to higher income tax payments and acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by higher cash collections from customers.","Slide eight provides some additional color about our anticipated near-term capital deployment in light of the B\/E Aerospace acquisition. As always, we'll continue to invest in organic growth by investing in R&D and our capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales.","We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage over the next few years. Since we have levered up to fund the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace, our debt-to-EBITDA is a little over four times.","We expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be under three within two years. And we remain focused on shareowner return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income.","We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes in the range of two to two and a half times, we expect resume our normal share repurchase program.","We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity and flexibility and preserving our solid investment-grade credit rating, which I'm pleased to report, will remain investment-grade, as planned, subsequent to placing all of the debt to fund the B\/E acquisition.","The weighted average interest rate on the debt we placed in the last few weeks was about 3.4%, which was in the range we expected when we announced the deal last October.","Now on to slide nine, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2017 financial guidance, updated for the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace, which we've renamed Interior Systems. That acquisition closed on April 13th.","Total sales are projected to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, which includes estimated sale of about $1.4 billion for Interior Systems. Total segment operating margins are projected to be in the range of 19% to 20%, down from the original guidance of about 21%.","Our expectations for total segment operating margins has not changed for our legacy Rockwell Collins business. The lower total segment operating margin guidance is due to the inclusion of expected margins for Interior Systems in the range of 11% to 12%, which includes about 700 basis points of estimated margin headwind from acquisition-related intangible asset amortization.","On a stand-alone basis, our GAAP earnings per share guidance for Rockwell Collins before adjusting for the B\/E acquisition would be in the range of $5.35 to $5.50. Our GAAP earnings per share guidance includes all -- including all of the impacts from the B\/E Aerospace acquisition is $4.50 to $4.70 and our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $5.95 to $6.15.","We provided a roll-forward of our estimated GAAP earnings per share as well as the reconciling items to our newly defined adjusted earnings per share guidance on slide 10 in this presentation as well as in the non-GAAP table in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","As you look at this guidance for the first time, I want to remind you that the adjusted earnings per share guidance is based on a preliminary purchase accounting allocation and is subject to potential adjustments that could be material.","In addition, adjusted earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares for fiscal 2017, which includes the issuance of 31.2 million shares of Rockwell Collins common stock on April 13th in connection with the acquisition.","Due to the timing of the share issuance, the earnings per share impact of the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace will be different in our annual results compared with our quarterly results.","We're currently planning that weighted average diluted shares for fiscal year 2017 will be around 147 million shares. During the third and fourth quarters, we're planning the weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be about 163 million shares.","Now, let's walk through the -- talk through the bridge we have provided for standalone GAAP earnings per share guidance to our new GAAP earnings per share guidance. There are a number of moving pieces, including the dilutive impact of adjusting for the 31.2 million shares issued, which has an impact of about $0.55.","In addition, we included about $0.70 of B\/E Aerospace acquisition-related expenses, $0.55 of new B\/E acquisition-related intangible asset amortization and $0.40 of new interest expense.","Excluding these items, we are estimating B\/E Aerospace will provide net income in the range of $200 million to $210 million in our fiscal year 2017 or between $1.35 and $1.40 of earnings per share.","Now, I'd like to walk through our thought process providing the new adjusted earnings per share guidance, which excludes estimated B\/E Aerospace acquisition-related expenses as well as amortization of total combined acquisition-related intangible asset amortization.","We spent a lot of time talking to investors and internally evaluating the most relevant metric investors are focused on in evaluating the performance of Rockwell Collins. It became very clear in today's environment; investors are keenly focused on our cash flow performance and as a result, guiding and reporting on a more cash flow based earnings per share metric is preferred by most investors.","Not to mention the fact that with the significant amount of transaction amortization, we believe there will likely be different analysts using different non-GAAP numbers in their estimates and we're hoping to drive uniformity in how analysts talk to our earnings performance.","Now, I'd like to move on to our free cash flow guidance, where we've increased our guidance $50 million with the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace. We now expect free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $750 million in fiscal year 2017.","Research and development investment is projected to be $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which increased from the previous range of $900 million to $950 million. Our full year income tax rate is now expected to be 27% to 28%, down from the previous range from 28% to 29%.","Before I hand the call back over, I want of give you a quick update on the revenue recognition standard. Our interpretation of the new standard is substantially complete and our assessment of the impacts of adoption is beginning to take shape.","Some of the larger changes under the new standard include accounting for preproduction engineering costs, customer funding related to commercial contracts, increased use of overtime revenue recognition based on costs incurred for government contracts, and the elimination of customer-related intangible assets related to free products provided to customers as upfront sales incentives.","Of the anticipated changes, the company expects the change in accounting for preproduction engineering cost and customer funding for commercial contracts will have the most significant impact on the financial statements. Customer funding received for the development effort is currently recognized as revenue as the development activities are performed.","Under the new standard, that development effort does not qualify as revenue as the effort is expended. Therefore, customer funding specific to the development effort must be deferred as a contract liability and recognized as revenue when products are delivered to the customer, thus delaying the timing of the revenue recognition.","We currently expensed development costs associated with commercial contracts unless the arrangement includes a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Upon adoption of the new standard, development cost will be expenses incurred, except for those costs incurred pursuant to customer funding which will be capitalized.","Development cost incurred pursuant to contractual guarantees for reimbursement, today reported in inventory as preproduction engineering costs will no longer be capitalized. At the time of the adoption, we'll basically restate our financial statements to eliminate our preproduction engineering balance.","The company continues to evaluate the impacts associated with the new standard and we are assessing the implications of the B\/E Aerospace acquisition on our implementation plan. The new standard is effective for the company in 2019 with early adoption permitted but not earlier than 2018.","The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We're still contemplating our adoption method, and we'll provide more updates over the balance of this year.","Now, that completes my review of the financial results and projections. But before we go to Ryan for the Q&A session, I want to hand it back to Kelly for one final comment.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks Patrick. I want to acknowledge a transition that we -- will be taking place in our Investor Relations function. You likely saw an announcement last week that Ryan Miller is moving on to be our Vice President and Controller of our Commercial Systems business. And I've received feedback from many of you about the very professional job that Ryan has done over the past three and a half years already, and I'd like to publicly acknowledge his great work and thank him on behalf of the company and our shareowners.","The previous controller of our Commercial Systems business was Steve Buesing, who many of you remember was our last Investor Relations lead. Steve is moving on to be the Vice President and Controller of our newly created Interior Systems business.","And then beginning May 1, our new Investor Relations lead will be Adam Palmer. Adam comes out of our finance organization, where he's held a number of leadership positions over the last 10-plus years. Most recently, Adam was our Senior Director of External Financial Reporting.","And one thing I do know for sure is if you want to talk and dive into new revenue recognition standards or pension accountings or any other technical accounting detail, Adam is your guy.","Adam and Ryan have been working very closely over the last few months, and my expectation is that we won't miss a beat in terms of providing the kind of service that you all expect from our company. So, Ryan, thank you very much, and Adam welcome aboard.","And with that, Ryan, let's move on to Q&A.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Kelly. I really appreciate those nice words. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we'll answer those additional questions if time permits.","Operator, we're now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kelly Ortberg","Hello Rajeev?","Operator","If you are on mute, could you please unmute your line?","Rajeev Lalwani","Hello? ","Kelly Ortberg","Hello. We've got you now.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. Sorry. In terms of the accretion associated with the B\/E transaction, can you just provide some updated figures? It seems like based on the full year guide, the numbers might be a little higher, so some color would be great.","Patrick Allen","Well, let me have -- let me give you a little bit of color. I'm not sure what additional detail you want. But we look at it, at B\/E adding $1.35 to $1.40 kind of in core operations, which implies about $1.4 billion of sales at an operating margin of 11% to 12%.","That 11% to 12% includes 750 basis points of amortization headwind, so you're talking about it, kind of a core operating margin that -- of 19% to 20%, which is pretty much in line with the B\/E kind of legacy operating margins, with a little bit of synergies thrown in because we are going to start seeing some synergies, particularly some of the corporate synergies kind of fold in, in the back half of our year.","Rajeev Lalwani","Sorry Patrick, I was referring to the double-digit earnings accretion, just an update on those numbers.","Patrick Allen","You mean the double-digit earnings accretion in 2018?","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes.","Patrick Allen","I would say we're still on track to achieving double-digit earnings accretion in 2018. I really don't have an update on 2018 at this point.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, again in my prepared comments, I talked about the cost synergy capture. I feel really good about that, that's a key element of achieving that double-digit accretion and so we're very much on track and very bullish about our ability to achieve that in fiscal year 2018.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Hey, everybody. Thank you. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Let me give consideration to the new revenue recognition and the impact of the deal amortization. Are you still forecasting free cash flow conversion of great than 100% fiscal 2018? The way you were guiding to it before those accounting noises maybe altered the way you're going to actually report it. That's my kind of question.","Patrick Allen","What I'd say is we're still tracking to 100% free cash flow conversion, yes, in 2018.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And the way you had been guiding to it before this accounting noise, so it's going to be some sort of like adjusted--","Patrick Allen","No, no. I'd say clearly, we had been accounting for it prior to the revenue recognition standard, yes; we're still on track for 100% free cash flow conversion.","Hunter Keay","Thanks very much.","Patrick Allen","Okay.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Good morning gentlemen.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Carter.","Carter Copeland","A couple of -- just clarifications, Patrick, because I think the math is important. On the double-digit accretion number, I just want to be clear here. So, we're not doing 1.1 times on a new adjusted EPS number. There's a clean apples-to-apples 2017 number that adds back the deal expenses and the incremental interest, but takes out the share issuance, which would get you to something, I think, in the high fives as opposed to the low sixes, which is then, if you put 10% on that's -- it's a different number than something in the high fives.","And then the second one, can you clarify again on the -- it sounds like you're going to, at some point, write-down the deferred engineering balance either at once or over an extended period of time. Can you just clarify that for us?","Patrick Allen","Yes, Carter. What I'd say is related to the double-digit accretion, just to be clear on that. When we talked about double-digit accretion, we're talking about relative to our standalone 2018 numbers.","Now, we haven't shared what those numbers are, but I think you have a -- probably have a pretty good sense as to where we would be on a standalone basis. And we -- so the 1.1 times would be times that base and I'm sorry and I missed the second half of your question.","Carter Copeland","It really just relates to the accounting change. And it sounded as if you will write off that balance and no longer have that amortization. But you said there were two ways to recognize that. I just wondered if you could give us some more color and clarify that.","Patrick Allen","Yes, just to be clear. The two biggest changes, one you just referred to, which is we will effectively write-off the preproduction engineering balance and will not amortize that in the future upon adoption of the standard.","The other big change is related to our customer-funded engineering. As you know, we've been very successful on the commercial side of the business in negotiating customer funding. And historically, we've treated that as revenue as we've expended the effort.","And we can no longer do that under the new standard. We'll actually be deferring revenue associated with all of our customer-funded effort and then recognizing that over time as shipments occur and so we're -- those are the two biggest changes.","Now the timing of when we adopt that revenue recognition standard, we're still sorting through. We may do it either in 2018 using a modified retrospective method or do it in 2019 and kind of a whole retrospective method. Now we're still evaluating those two alternatives.","Carter Copeland","But either way, the combination of those two things is going to have a pretty solid uplift on your margins?","Patrick Allen","It should be a positive set of margins, yes.","Carter Copeland","Awesome. I'll get back in the queue. And congrats on closing the deal.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks Carter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Patrick, I hate to belabor these numbers issues, but when you're talking about the free cash flow conversion, was that looking at a GAAP number? Or was that looking at a new Rockwell Collins defined adjusted number?","Patrick Allen","It was really kind of a GAAP number.","Robert Stallard","Okay. That's all right. And then an actual, real question. Kelly, one of the other aerospace suppliers yesterday said they had seen some impact from destocking on what they called legacy programs, like 777, 300 coming down and A380, have you seen any signs of that in your business?","Kelly Ortberg","No, not in Air Transport, but recognize that when others have seen that, we have historically not seen that in Air Transport. Just probably our commodity set is different. As you know we are seeing in destocking play out pretty significantly in our Bizjet OEM market space, but I haven't seen anything -- and I wouldn't anticipate, even if there is heavy destocking that that would flow through our portfolio.","Robert Stallard","That's great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kelly Ortberg","Matt, do you have your mic muted?","Matt McConnell","Sorry about that. Can you hear me, guys?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, we can.","Matt McConnell","Okay, great. Could you just provide an update on B\/E's underlying operating performance since the deal was announced? And you had given some good disclosure in your deal docs on -- I think you were looking for like 6.5% revenue growth in 2017. Has that changed at all since October? And just give us an update on how the revenue outlook looks for 2017?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, Patrick gave you the topline number. Just a couple of comments. First of all, we're not through an audited set of financials for the last quarter, so I can't speak to the -- any detailed numbers relative to last quarter. The other thing I'd do is I'd probably caution you on, if you're talking about the S-4 numbers, recognize that those were calendar year, not fiscal year. Those were point-in-time, not guidance estimates going forward.","Having said that, I think our revenues, our growth, are probably a little shy of the topline numbers you saw in the S-4, more low to mid-single-digit growth. And that -- if I point to any variance there, it'd just be the timing of some of the business related to the Emirates moving out their A380 deliveries, which were announced here earlier this year.","As far as the EBIT performance, we're pretty close on that. In spite of some -- a little bit of softening at the topline, I think we're pretty close to those numbers on EBIT performance.","Matt McConnell","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. Could you comment on how much of cost synergies you expect in fiscal 2017? And how much of integration expense items you'll be? And then maybe a clarification on this double-digit accretion, are we talking apples-to-apples, i.e., Rockwell Collins pre the accounting change, plus over 10% and Rockwell Collins after the accounting change plus 10%?","Patrick Allen","What I would say is Cai it is apples-to-apples. It's what I'll describe old GAAP to old GAAP. So, none of that double-digit accretion reflects any benefit from the revenue recognition adoption.","As it relates to the synergies and the cost to achieve, I'd say there are both of those things in our numbers, probably almost an equal measures, actually, for FY 2017. So, we're seeing about half of the benefit from our -- the corporate cost takeout, but a little bit less than half of that in the back half of 2017, half of the annual run rate and the cost to achieve almost offset that.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Thanks. Good morning Kelly, Patrick.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Peter.","Peter Arment","Just a question, Kelly, I guess, you mentioned it briefly, and I'm sure you probably want to save this for the Investor Day, but kind of the stretch goals on the synergies. The $160 million, any update of just kind of how you're feeling about those different buckets? And then is this, the stretch goals, is just an expansion of those categories? Or is it a new category since your due diligence?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, it's a little of both, Peter. As we've done more detailed planning, we found some additional synergies, I'd say, in the same categories. I'll give you a couple examples. Some of our indirect material and supply spend; some of our tax planning strategies are showing opportunity beyond our original plan.","And we detailed out our SAP implementations now. We've been in detailed planning with B\/E through the quarter. And those now with -- now that we have a detailed plan, are proving to provide some additional savings from what we originally anticipated. So, some in there.","The others that I would say we didn't anticipate is some opportunities to vertically integrate some capability on some of the programs. They've got some really nice positions and capabilities and then things like panels and wiring harnesses and stuff that we're finding opportunities here to go do more collectively together.","So again, I'm pretty encouraged. This is a work in process. One thing we haven't been able to do pre-close is exchange any proprietary data around supply agreements. So, we brought in consultants to help us get that off and rolling to kind of be the intermediary. This week, we're peeling all those back now that we can exchange that information and get off and get those things in place.","So, look, I feel good about both the absolute value of the $160 million, but also, the time phasing looks pretty good right now. So, everything's as expected going forward.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the guide. Congrats on the deal.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","Yes, I just wanted to follow up. Did you ever give an answer to what synergies we'll be seeing in 2017? And also previously you had mentioned purchase accounting benefits that we would -- to get some formal accounting that we would see. I was wondering whether any of that's in your guidance.","And the last one, on the free cash flow conversion of one on a GAAP basis that seems low to me, given that you're going to have the $0.75 of estimated amortization continuing, which is almost like 15% of the earnings. So, if you could just explain that a little bit further.","Kelly Ortberg","I'll hit the synergy one and then have Pat answer the rest of your questions. Again, the major cost synergies that are incorporated in our fiscal 2017 guide are associated with the reduction of duplicate corporate function. That actually happened on day one. And so there's both severance cost or cost to achieve those synergies. And obviously, the lack of that payroll and those cost for the balance of the year and they pretty much wash out in our fiscal 2017.","Patrick Allen","And on your free cash flow question, George. What I'd say is what we said is we're going to have free cash flow in excess of 100%. So, I agree, I think 100% would be pretty conservative. I think we're pretty comfortably above that.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.","Peter Skibitski","Good morning guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Pete.","Peter Skibitski","Kelly, I guess I wanted to ask one non-financial question on the -- I'm wondering how -- in looking at the deal and the pricing, kind how you judge the level of IP resident at B\/E, especially in commercial seating when you kind of look around and think about the problems that Zodiac has and some of the new seating companies kind of popping up around the world. How do you think about things like barriers to entry and IP in seating when you're thinking about the deal and the pricing?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, I think it's a little different than our core avionics. One of the things that is very different is, particularly in some of the business and first-class seating, is the proprietary nature of the customization that they do hand-in-hand with their customers. And that's a big barrier to entry for anybody to come in because they're partnering and helping design that. And of course, the airlines want that unique because it differentiates their brand delivery to their overall customer.","Having said that, they've got a pretty decent patent portfolio of patents across their product lines on techniques to implement the seating. I don't think their -- I don't think IP is a major barrier for someone that wants to do interior products in the marketplace. I think certification, customer affinity are major barriers. But I don't think it's probably a big IP barrier.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. I think we're all trying to beat around the same bush on cash flow conversion, but wanted to ask it a different way. So, you're moving to this adjusted pro forma number that's excluding intangible amortization. So, Patrick, are you going to be able to convert 100% of this new number to free cash flow? It seems like your intent is to better align it to cash.","Patrick Allen","Yes, I would say we'll be very close.","Myles Walton","Okay. All right. That's good. Kelly, on the IMS, the margins are pretty striking there, and yet you had a really good growth in the non-aviation piece, which I usually think of as being someone dilutive. So is the non-aviation piece, I guess, such as with this nuclear service business, actually good-margin business?","Patrick Allen","I'd say no. I think it's still -- we still are going to have mix issues. That non-aviation piece is lower margin. We just had a very strong margin quarter from the Aviation business.","Myles Walton","And do you think that was one-off in terms of retention?","Patrick Allen","There really was -- we had some hardware deliveries that were at pretty good margins, but there nothing I'd say, no reserve adjustments or anything else, no noise in the numbers, it was just strong performance.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Again, we had good top line performance in the connectivity component in both Air Transport and the Biz Av market. If you recall, we invested. Since we made the acquisition of ARINC, we've been investing and building out our VHF ground network, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. And that investment's returning here. We're seeing a good payback. It's giving us growth.","And as you know, the incremental margins in that core aviation are pretty good. So, I'm really pleased with that investment. We're still doing some buildout this year as well and spending some capital to do that. But I'm pleased with how we're getting return on that in the market.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Congrats on closing the deal.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks.","Patrick Allen","Thanks.","Robert Spingarn","Just on that, as a follow-up to that, then I have a specific question on commercial OE, but with regard to the IMS, how do we think about this growth continuing, remainder of this year and into next year, given the buildout which you just talked about?","And separate question is going to be, Patrick, could you parse out the minus 5% on the commercial OE with regard to the end markets? In other words, how much was Bizjet down and how much was commercial or Air Transport up?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, as far as the IMS growth, I can't say we're going to sit here and post these kind of growth numbers every quarter. But look, we have historically been performing high single-digit growth. Our long-term plan has always been to drive that high single-digit, get some synergies and get it to double-digit and so we're tracking to that.","I think you should continue to view our core Aviation business as high single-digit growth. And then we've been working on trying to get more stable growth out of the non-aviation businesses. In the last few quarters, as you can see, we're doing a pretty good job on that. So, IMS business continues to be the highest-growth portfolio in the company, and I don't see that changing.","Patrick Allen","And as it relates to commercial OE, Bizjets are down 19% and I would say that's going to be our worst quarter from a comparability perspective and it'll improve in the back half of the year. And the Air Transport is up about 5%.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kristine Liwag","Hey guys, its Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Kristine.","Kristine Liwag","We've heard from some airlines that they're looking at refurbishing wide bodies because pricing in the used market is now very attractive. And so assuming the best case scenario for you guys, how much content per aircraft could you get if you're able to leverage revenue synergies and get upgrades for premium seats, interiors, electronics, and pretty much the whole enchilada?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, that's a big spread. Depends on what they do. I mean, it can go from millions to multiple millions per aircraft depending on the extent of the retrofits. But I'd say, on average, the retrofit revenue per airplane would probably be a little bit less than the new build revenue per airplane because they're not going to replace everything in the retrofit market.","Having said that, I'm pretty encouraged, we had a really good Hamburg Interior Show. There's a lot of opportunities. In fact we -- at that show every year, the interiors team really does a detailed forecast of the opportunities over the next 18 months. And they sit down which each one of their customers and go through their forward-fit and retrofit plans and that looked pretty encouraging.","And I will say that the retrofit was a higher component of that outlook than it was last year. So, people are planning more retrofits in wide bodies. And I think we got a really good product line and a strong relationship with the end market customers that we'll be able to go capture some of that.","Kristine Liwag","Would you be able to quantify how much of the opportunity is for the next 18 months?","Kelly Ortberg","No, not yet. We'll see how those play out. We'll quantify it once we've captured the programs.","Kristine Liwag","Sure. And maybe a follow-up on the seat market. I guess at Hamburg, too, we've seen a lot of new seat and interiors players enter the market, with Adient from the automotive industry. And it looks like LIFT by EnCore extended their offerings, too. So with Zodiac's operational issues, can you provide color on what you're seeing in the competitive environment and maybe opportunities for market share gain for BEAV?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, not a lot of change in the competitive environment. I mean, there's been other players. Some of the players you named are not new to this space. And so we feel really good about the competitiveness of our product. I feel pretty good that the combined entity is going to even create more value for the end customers. And we feel like we'll be able to compete fine.","I will also say that I've been saying all along that I believe there are opportunities for us to do more standard equipment with the OEMs across the Board. And what you're seeing is the OEMs looking at doing more standard equipment. And believe me, we know those OEMs quite well. And I think this presents an opportunity. I think that what you're seeing in the market validates that that's an opportunity for us.","Kristine Liwag","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham. Your line is open.","Richard Safran","Good morning everybody.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Richard Safran","So, I thought I would ask a question here about Intertrade and some comments you've made previously. I think you've been talking about more tempered growth there, if I'm not mistaken. And what I was wondering, is this -- if the used aircraft installed base is growing, we're getting a lot of the deliveries made in 2010 and 2011 coming due, then why Intertrade wouldn't keep pace with that?","And I was wondering if we should maybe be expecting a step-up in demand for recertified parts as a result of the installed base growth? So, if possible, could you explain why, if we're seeing the aircraft installed base grow, Intertrade's growth might temper here? And in your answer, maybe discuss what growth rates you're actually thinking about now.","Kelly Ortberg","Well, I'm glad you asked that question. Historically, over the last couple of years, we've been seeing double-digit growth out of our Intertrade business. And I think I've said in previous calls that, that has slowed down and I'm not expecting much growth this year. I think I'm going to be wrong on that. I think that we are going to see a stronger Intertrade. As I look, there are a lot more opportunities than what we saw when we entered into the year.","So, Intertrade growth is -- we're going to see some Intertrade growth, I think, in the back half of the year. And the phenomenon is driven by what you're talking about, is there are more opportunities, and particularly, larger opportunities for us in Intertrade, which they've become a little lumpy, whether it's in engine or it's a fuselage, they become a little lumpy for us, but they're pretty large sales opportunities. And we've got several of those that we're working right now for the balance of the year.","Richard Safran","Thanks. Appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Sam.","Patrick Allen","Hi Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Just a couple of things. Can you -- the $50 million increase in free cash and the R&D increase, are those both only B\/E? Or did any of the kind of core legacy Rockwell Collins change?","Kelly Ortberg","No, Sam it's all B\/E.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And since this balance sheet that you provided is of course March 31, where are you right now from a cash and a debt and even an equity standpoint?","Patrick Allen","We have about $8 billion of debt in total, $6 billion to finance the acquisition and $2 billion kind of legacy from Rockwell Collins. That's our current debt position. Cash, I don't think has changed much. We've spent most of it on the acquisition, of course.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. All right. Just because we obviously don't know what March 31 for B\/E would look like. And then just, Kelly, from your discussions, have you seen any change in plans or production rates for business jet OE from when you have last talked to us in January with regard to the guidance?","Kelly Ortberg","No, not really. I mean, look, we had a pretty soft quarter obviously here. And it was pretty much across the board. And I think you heard Textron report pretty weak King Air sales here earlier in the week and that played through our portfolio. It continues to be a watch area. We're very hopeful that we get to the bottom of the market here in fiscal 2019.","Pat -- as Pat said, we think probably this quarter is going to be, comparable, our worst quarter in Biz Av. So, I'm not seeing anything that's indicative of a significant improvement in the market space right now.","And as you know, I've said this and I'll say it again, I'm going to remain pretty conservative in my outlook on Business Aviation until I actually see strong signs of orders and rate increases. And I don't -- I just don't see that yet.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the interior segment and maybe over the next couple of years, the sort of relative growth rate you expect for the different pieces in terms of maybe sort of the legacy seating and interiors business versus some of the big SFE programs versus retrofits, versus spares. And kind of obviously not numbers, but just sort of it in a relative sense, how those growth opportunities stack up over the next, let's say, I don't know, two to three years?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. So there's a lot of moving parts there. On the wide-body, we're going to see the rate improvement on the A350. We've got really good share on the 787. So wide-body, new wide-body aircraft, is a good growth driver for us. We're obviously going to see rate reductions on the legacy wide-bodies like the 777 legacy aircraft playing in and the A380 as well as the 747 rate. So, it's kind of a mix.","The narrow-body is very strong, and we're going to see continued growth. Also with the larger narrow-bodies, it gives us opportunities to up-gauge the interiors, more business-class opportunities as well as just seating in the market going forward.","I think we are going to see headwinds in super first-class. That really ties to the very large aircraft and that's clearly a market that's not strong. And I don't think that's going to change until we get the very larger -- much larger 777X and A350 into the market.","So, we are experiencing the decline in the super first-class and I think that's going to continue. So, our job is to go transition and capture the single aisle and narrow-body marketplace as well as the growing wide-body 787 and A350 market.","Now, you know we've got new standard positions as well on the A350 and new standard lab positions on the 737. And so as those kind of ramp up, that will give us some good standard position growth as well.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning David.","David Strauss","Patrick, the $100 million in after-tax acquisition-related expenses, how much of that is cash this year? And what is the outlook for that in 2018? And then an update on expectation for future book tax rate. And also, any color you could give around cash taxes as well.","Patrick Allen","Sure. As it relates to the transaction cost, the $100 million after-tax, first of all, almost all of that is cash. As a matter of fact, I think all of its cash. And most of it is non-recurring. You won't see it next year. The only piece that you're going to see returning is let's call it cost to achieve synergies. We had a little bit of that in that $100 million dollars. And that will continue next year as we continue to integrate the business and realize the synergies.","As it relates to going forward taxes, I think what I've said in the current tax environment, I look for tax, the tax rate kind of in that 26% range on a combined basis. I think cash taxes are generally in the 90% to 100% of our provision, at least at this point.","David Strauss","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert","Hi good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Ken.","Ken Herbert","Hey, I just wanted to follow up on Government Systems. Obviously, not as big a mix of the portfolio now moving forward, but you had another 5% growth in the quarter. You start to anniversary some more difficult comps. Can you just provide, Kelly, any commentary on, one, your view of the CR and how that gets resolved? And any impact on the business you see moving forward?","But then second, as you get into the second half of the fiscal year, maybe some of the key moving pieces from a program standpoint and confidence here in the full year number for that segment. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, well, the CR, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've really seen a few program slips while we're under the CR. I'm hopeful that we'll get, like, a week extension and then we'll get some sort of a bill here. If that doesn't happen, I think we'll see more impact in our business, as I mentioned.","Having said that, if -- without a CR, we would have had really good growth in our government portfolio and the orders are tracking to support the sales that we need for the back half of the year.","Some areas of relative strength in our GPS area, advanced GPS work, as well as missiles and munitions, our JDAM businesses has been a good growth driver for us and we expect that to continue.","We've had a really good demand for our advanced data links as we're putting new networks and new waveforms into that marketplace. I expect that to continue. We've got -- we're starting to see revenues pick up from some of these international C-130 programs, and if you recall, were important to our last year A320 second half growth.","So, look, I feel pretty good about the backlog. We've got a lot of programs out there. We're capturing them. This TCTS was a big program. It's over -- well over $100 million program for us and that will drive revenues. And we're positioned on the things like the tanker and the F-35 and all those other areas that are growing as well. So, our government portfolio's looking pretty good right now.","Ryan Miller","All right operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Michael Ciarmoli","Maybe just one housekeeping. Patrick, the amortization of the other intangible, I think the add-back is about $0.75 and the B\/E-related is about $0.55. What's sort of the delta there that's--?","Patrick Allen","The biggest shrink there is the amortization of our ARINC acquisition amortization. As we kind of moved to this adjusted earnings per share metric, didn't make sense to us to just exclude the B\/E amortization, but really include amortization from all of our acquisitions and obviously, the biggest component is ARINC, now IMS.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then just, Kelly, if I may, back to B\/E outlook. The $1.4 billion, I know there's timing with the calendar year. You talked about the one -- the Emirates order sliding out, is there any other concern there, just given the wide-body weakness that may have moderated that outlook? Or what you're seeing from airlines and maybe their desire to revisit their order books? I mean, has the confidence level changed at all in BEAV's backlog visibility? ","Kelly Ortberg","No, I don't think the backlog has. But that's something we got to continue to watch, any adjustments that happened to backlog plan rates. I'd particularly focus, and I am particularly focused, on the Middle East and whether there's any further adjustments there. And you heard -- we've heard from Delta that they're going to revisit their wide-body plan.","The extent to which that moves backlog to the right will have some impact on us and then we'll just have to look to other opportunities to offset that. But those are the two areas, I guess, I'll be watching for the balance of the year and probably more impactful to what's our growth rate for next year for that business.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Thanks a lot. Helpful guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan Miller","Thank you all for joining us and participating on today's conference call. We plan to file our 10-Q later today, so please read that document for additional disclosures.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Bonnie, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note, today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of the webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody.","As we conclude our fiscal year 2012, I believe it will be remembered as one of the most unpredictable in our history as a public company. Headwinds for the year included the delay of some domestic and international orders, defense program cuts and a bankruptcy at one of our key business jet customers. All of which were beyond our control, and which in aggregate, brought our revenue forecasts down about 4% when compared to our original guidance. However, as we work through that challenging market environment, we took actions to react quickly and manage the things within our control. These actions and our focus on execution resulted in full year earnings per share within the original guidance range, excluding the onetime charges taken this fourth quarter.","I'd like to have seen a better market environment. It should not mask the great work of our people who responded to deliver higher rates of profitability and preserve future growth opportunities. Now nowhere is this more evident than in our Commercial Systems fourth quarter results that were strong across the board. Total revenue was up 9%. And if you exclude the impact of wide-body in-flight entertainment which we no longer invest in, the core business would be up 13%.","OEM revenue grew 15%, led by 26% growth in air transport, and that's after absorbing the headwind created by the reduction in output due to the Hawker Beechcraft bankruptcy.","In the commercial, aftermarket revenue increased 12%, driven by cockpit and cabin upgrades across both business segments.","It's interesting that in the year of unpredictability, this is the one we got right. We suggested in our third quarter that flat results in this area would return to growth in Q4, which is exactly what happened. We expect continued revenue growth in the aftermarket as we go into 2013, driven primarily by new product introductions that enhance aircraft efficiency and early equipage of TCAS and data link mandate.","I think you can also see the diligent work of our people in Government Systems as well despite results that were weaker this year and this quarter than we originally projected.","Looking back over this past year, accurately forecasting revenue in this sector was extraordinarily difficult, especially considering the realities of congressional gridlock, continued Pentagon re-prioritization and the uncertainty created by the pending impacts of sequestration.","Revenue for Government Systems was down 10% in the quarter, resulting from several anticipated declines, including E-6, DAGR, JTRS Ground Mobile Radio and other surface-based programs. However, what did not happen as expected was the conversion of about $75 million in growth programs that due to order delays, customer requests or changing priorities were slipped out of the year.","Let me give you some color around 2 of the largest programs that impacted the majority of this unexpected reduction in Q4.","We'd expected the Defense Acquisition Board review for the JTRS Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Factor radio to take place on July 26, resulting in an approval of the Low Rate Initial Production order and product deliveries beginning in our fourth quarter. However, due to a request for more testing, this review was delayed to October, where as you know, the program go-ahead was approved.","The other issue resulted from a European customer for a ground-based software-defined radio that has requested some enhanced capabilities to that radio, which they funded. So we agreed to their request to curtail shipments until next calendar year to incorporate the additional functionality.","And while unfortunate, these kind of developments reflect the uncertainties that's seen in over abundance within the defense markets at this time.","So in total, company revenue declined modestly in the fourth quarter, but we were able to achieve a 260 basis points expansion in operating margins by containing cost and focusing on operational efficiency.","We saw much of the same results for the full year as the balance of our business continued to shift toward Commercial Systems, which represents about 45% of total company revenue today and is moving toward parity in FY '13.","Now looking ahead to 2013, we provided our initial guidance about a month ago and it remains unchanged. Market conditions impacting our guidance will be directionally the same, with good growth in commercial, offset by continued weakness in government. However, as you know, we have factored in our estimate of the sequestration impact on U.S. Defense budgets, which I think many of you feel will not happen. Well, I hope you're right, and that sanity will somehow be restored in Washington. Nevertheless, even if sequestration is delayed and replaced by a long-term continuing resolution that effectively kicks the can, I expect that the potential impacts from the continuing resolution and an ongoing overhang of sequestration at a later date could be similar to the current sequester scenario.","So knowing that we cannot control this outcome, we are preparing for all scenarios and taking actions early this time. For example, we've announced significant headcount reductions and the plan to reorganize our European operations, with some of those resources that redistributed into other international growth markets. We are also consolidating some U.S. facilities and heightening our focus on bringing commercially-based solutions to the military, like our Pro Line Fusion-based KC-390 flight deck in Brazil and another recently announced Pro Line Fusion position on Agusta's 609 helicopter.","We believe these actions will not only help us address the challenges we face this year, but also provide enhanced leverage to capitalize on longer-term growth.","So with the silvering results in FY '12, and the prospects I've outlined for this year, it's fair to ask how I feel about that longer-term for Rockwell Collins.","Well, let me say that I have never felt more optimistic nor been able to see more clearly those opportunities that lie ahead in FY '14 and beyond. And here is why.","Commercial Systems, which will be the primary growth driver, sits on the cusp of a raft of market share gains that begin to roll out and accelerate in FY '14 and beyond. They include 787, Airbus 350, CSeries, Japanese MRJ, Chinese ARJ21, Brazilian Embraer 450 and 500, Bombardier's Global 7000 and 8000, Lear 85 and several we have yet to disclose. And if that's not enough, I can tell you that we were selected for one of the commercial programs referenced in our guidance release, although I'm not yet at liberty to disclose the customer or other details at this time.","As for Government Systems, nothing goes down forever. And at some point, we'll get past this sequestration circus, reach a rational funding level and the bleeding will stop. While it is very difficult to accurately predict that market right now, improvement in 2014 or 2015 is not unreasonable. By that time, we will have a solid core business, run very efficiently with more international content, and a number of surviving development programs transitioning to production to supplement our strong legacy portfolio. This includes Tanker Program, software-defined radios, network communication, next-generation GPS navigation, cockpit upgrades to aging fixed and rotary wing fleets and forward air control targeting systems. These are the reasons I look forward to this company's future. Stay tuned for us to further quantify the future impact of our growth opportunities in the coming months.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick for additional detail.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay, and good morning to everyone as well.","Let's get started by first reviewing our results for the total company that are shown on Slides 3 and 4.","Total company sales for the quarter came in at $1.27 billion, a 2% decrease from last year. Income from continuing operations decreased 4%, while earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4%.","Earnings per share increased even as net income declined due to the benefit of our share repurchases. Income and earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 included a $0.26 or $37 million after-tax restructuring and net asset impairment charge. About half the charge is related to severance costs, while the remainder of the charge primarily related to the write-off of impaired accounts receivable.","We expect to realize an annual benefit of about $75 million from the restructuring actions, a portion of that benefit being realized in FY '13.","Now if I exclude the $0.26 restructuring and asset impairment charges from 2012 and the $0.11 restructuring charge recorded in 2011 for each quarter's results, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased by 17%.","Turning to Slides 5 and 6, we have the fourth quarter results for Commercial Systems, which reported sales of $565 million, up 9% from last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $39 million or 15% to $307 million, driven by increased Boeing 787 sales, higher production rates at Boeing and Airbus, and increased product deliveries to Bombardier and Cessna. These increases were partially offset by lower deliveries to Hawker Beechcraft. Aftermarket revenue grew 12% to $239 million, driven by increased retrofit sales to both air transport and business jet customers, as well as increased service and support revenue.","Commercial Systems' operating earnings increased to $122 million or 21.6% of sales compared to operating earnings of $101 million or 19.5% of sales in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margins was primarily due to higher sales and lower employee-related costs.","On Slide 7, Government Systems revenue declined 10% to $701 million. Avionics sales decreased $20 million or 5% due to the completion of certain rotary wing and unmanned aerial system programs and lower development sales as the E6 Program transitions to production. We did see an increase in tanker revenue this quarter from the KC-135, 545 and KC-46 programs.","Communication products sales declined $12 million or 6%, driven by the wind down in the JTRS GMR development program.","Surface Solutions sales decreased 40%, principally driven by our previous decision to discontinue investment in public safety vehicle systems and the completion of certain surface-based development programs.","Finally, Navigation Products sales were down 9% to $73 million, driven by fewer deliveries of our GPS receivers.","Slide 8 shows Government Systems' fourth quarter operating earnings which were $175 million or 25% of sales compared to $170 million or 21.8% last year. The improved operating performance was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, as we completed a number of significant company-funded product developments and lower employee-related costs. These benefits were partially offset by the lower sales volume.","On Slide 9, we have our full year total company financial results for sales, EPS from continuing operations, income from continuing operations and operating cash flow.","In 2012, sales decreased by 2% as the headwinds in Government Systems were mostly offset by the growth in Commercial Systems.","Our year-to-date operating cash flow of $534 million is lower than last year due to increased payments from employee incentive compensation and higher income tax payments.","Our cash flow for the quarter came in short of expectations, driven by revenue delays in Government Systems and the timing of collections on the last few days of the fiscal year.","Moving to Slide 10, we show the status of our capital structure. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $779 million in long-term debt outstanding compared to $528 million at the end of fiscal 2011. We do believe our debt to total capital ratio of 38%, in combination with our investment-grade credit ratings, provides us the necessary access to liquidity in a cost-effective manner.","If you turn to Slide 11, we provide details related to the updated status of our share repurchase program as of the end of 2012.","During the year, we repurchased 13.3 million shares of stock at an average cost of $54.41 per share and reduced outstanding shares by 7%. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to 76 million shares or $3.7 billion return to share owners through maintaining an active share repurchase program, and we've reduced our outstanding share count by 23%. Currently, our available authorization is $481 million.","Now on to our final slide, Slide 12, where we provide the details of our fiscal 2013 financial guidance, which is unchanged from where we originally provided the last month.","We expect revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, with Commercial Systems increasing 7% next year, although that growth is not expected to be linear.","In the first quarter, headwinds from the lack of Hawker jet production and a negative 787 spares comparable will most likely offset growth in the rest of the commercial business. However, after a flat first quarter, growth should accelerate across the year as the headwinds from Hawker abate and the 787 spares transition from a headwind to a tailwind. In 2012, most of our 787 spares were delivered early in the year. While deliveries this year, we expect will be in the back half.","We expect regulatory mandates, increased retrofits and higher OEM production rates to drive increasing growth across the year for Commercial Systems.","In Government Systems, we forecast revenue to decline 10%, with about half resulting from the impacts of sequestration. Even though sequestration goes into affect partway through the year, we anticipate revenue will be down about 10% each quarter. Early in the year, we will see reductions resulting from the completion of some development programs as they transition to production. Later in the year, the headwind from these programs will moderate. But then, the impacts from the sequestration begin to impact our revenue.","At the total company level, we anticipate first quarter revenue will be down mid-single digits. The revenue decline should then moderate the remainder of the year as commercial growth almost offsets the government reductions across the remainder of the year. Additionally, most of the benefit realized from our restructuring actions in 2013 will likely affect the back half of our fiscal year. However, full year operating margin should maintain at about 21% in Government Systems, with Commercial Systems expanding by 200 basis points. These increases, coupled with continued share repurchase program, should result in earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.50.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Steve, back to you to kick off the Q&A.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Bonnie, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about this $15 million decrease in the company-funded R&D in government? Is that disinvestment on public safety or other spending, and really how long can you sustain this $20 million a quarter kind of run rate for company-funded R&D?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, first, let me say Sam, we don't expect that kind of a rate decline to continue into next year. I think that was a year-over-year comparable. That's very explainable by 3 things. First of all, the public safety investment, which you rightly cited, which was going strong at the end of last year, which we suspended as you recall at the beginning of this year and stopped investing in it, so that was a part of it. And then there were 2 development programs of products that we've completed, one for a Generation 5 ARC-210, which we had invested a lot of our own money in to evolve that under commercial practices. And the second was a new micro product for our GPS chip. That is a very small GPS driver introduction, which also was being developed last year, which we had completed. So both of those were completions of internal development. And there was, as you know, not a lot of investment to replace it for future programs because of the direction of the -- of that market. Now if I were looking at the relative discretionary flow of Government Systems over FY '13, it will be basically flat from where we ended in FY '12.","So what we've done is we've sized our R&D down aggressively in '12, and according to what the developments we were doing, and now we believe we can sustain that through next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","If we assume that you're keeping government R&D flat next year, it would imply that the investment in commercial is actually ramping up very significantly. Could you talk about that for a second?","Clayton M. Jones","I sure will be glad to. If you look at it -- first thing, if you look at a year where our overall corporate sales are actually declining slightly, and you look at all-in R&D, and by that I mean company discretionary still significant amounts of customer funding from the government, although that's declining, and then R&D that we're deferring under our balance sheet, that if you add all that together, our R&D will be increasing 9% in FY '13. And the relative split is mainly as a result of the customer funding decline in Government Systems, it will be going down around, I'd say, 8% to 10%. And the government -- and the commercial funding, all-in, will be increasing somewhere between 25% and 30%. And so we are fishing where the fish are, we are funding these growth initiatives I talked about in my opening remarks, and we're sizing our government to where it should be with this market. I would also mention that for our company, a great deal of the sales we anticipate in the government market will be coming from many of these commercial developments such as Pro Line Fusion that we'll be cross marketing.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one more if I could, it's related. It doesn't seem like R&D, lower R&D, was a quarter-on-quarter benefit for margins in the Government Systems business. Was there any type of reversal of accrued comp? And if not, what really drove that 25% margin?","Patrick E. Allen","You're right, company-funded R&D wasn't a significant driver. It was roughly flat from third quarter to fourth quarter. There was a compensation adjustment in the fourth quarter as sales and cash flow came down from our expectations. So yes, probably the biggest driver sequentially on the Government Systems side would have been -- I'll call it, all-in employee-related costs, lower headcount and the incentive compensation adjustment.","Clayton M. Jones","And Yair, that's why if you think about normalizing it for '13, what we're saying is we believe we can hold those government operating margins at around the 21% level, not at this concluding 25% level that you've seen here in the fourth quarter.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. So last quarter, I think you said that higher incentive comp would be about a $30 million to $40 million headwind next year. Should we think about it as being a little bit higher now?","Patrick E. Allen","No, actually, it's about the same. We set our incentive compensation at a 75% payout under this sequestration scenario, and we were a little bit under 50% for the year this year. So I would say -- I'd say that $30 million headwind is still about right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton with the Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","To go off of the Government side, the Government Systems side, so you fell a little short on the sales forecast for the fourth quarter and looking at the 10% decline level, you're looking at for '13, it looks like it's putting you kind of at the low end, just as the starting point of the sales range, given the 7% growth in commercial. And so that's fine. I just want to make sure that's right and accurate, and under a sequestration scenario assumption. And then tied to that, Clay, I think, I just want to understand more broadly, I think you said even under the kind of continuing resolution, stopgap measure, it might look like a sequestration. So are we kind of fair to assume that the 10% is kind of a baseline growth rate almost no matter what happens?","Patrick E. Allen","As it relates to the guidance for the year, what I would say is that given all of the uncertainties, I think we're operating within that range. I wouldn't take the mathematics as being an absolute law. I would say we're still pointing towards the middle of the range.","Clayton M. Jones","And Myles, to your second question, we size it based on sequestration. If sequestration doesn't happen, nobody knows what is going to happen. And so if there's a CR through the full year, that's going to have some impact, hardly know if this is exactly sequestration, but it will have some. If they kick the can only 6 months, we get the privilege of going through the whole sequestration drama in this fiscal year period. The point we're trying to make here is, something bad is going to happen out there, and we think we've accommodated it here, but I wouldn't run to the other side of the boat and say, \"Well, sequestration doesn't happen now, we're back to a full appropriations bill and it's life as once we knew it.\" I think this year is going to be very turbulent. My point is we're planning for it, we are structuring our company to do it. If all of a sudden, peace breaks out and everything is rosy and we got a grand bargain, we're more than ready and that means we've been conservative.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One quick follow up if I could on cash. So it sounded like the cash missed the 2012 number because of the timing of payments which -- or revenue, which I would assume would slip into '13, which brings to a question of '13. I know you have the preproduction headwind, but it looks like incentive comps and nice tailwinds kind of offsetting that. So can you walk through, maybe, Patrick, is there any other cash taxes or other things that are disproportionally negatively affecting pension contributions, anything like that affecting '13 cash?","Patrick E. Allen","No, I would say, first of all, we've gotten off to a gangbusters October because we collected about $40 million of cash on the first day of our fiscal year. So that is probably a bit of a tailwind. In terms of headwind, I think you've identified the ones that I would identify, which is the deferred engineering that we talked about in our guidance. Pensions year-over-year are about flat, and actually, incentive compensation will provide a little bit of a tailwind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to continue down the cash flow path. Just looking at this big picture, guys, you converted something like 65% of income after the charge into cash flow this year. It was 80% last year, you guys, historically have been 100% or more given the comp situation, and I know you're up to a good start this year and you have the capitalized R&D. But even besides that, it just seems like this continues to slip. Patrick, any other high-level thoughts you can put around this? And if we're ever going to see a recovery from here, or something else is changing besides just the capitalized R&D?","Patrick E. Allen","I think the biggest change we've seen over the course of the last few years is the capitalized R&D. And when I think about the value of the investment in that R&D, when you think about the investment next year, it's going into 4 programs. One is one we can't talk about, but then there's the A350, there's the CSeries, there's the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000. And these all represent market share gains and significant investments for the company and for the company's future. So I think it's cash well spent, but that's the -- to me, that's the biggest difference between cash flow, let's say, 5 years ago and cash flow today.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And your guidance for capitalized R&D for this coming year, you won one of those programs but there's more than 1. So how much of the cake is baked on the capitalized R&D number for 2013, given that 1 win?","Patrick E. Allen","I would tell you the cake is fully baked now.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Clay, your forecast for next year, I think is double-digit aftermarket growth overall. Can you just help us, give us some color there, I guess, more comfortable with that. I think a component of that is related to these couple of mandates, how much might come from that side versus just your normal sparing and service kind of stuff?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes, Dave, I'll try to do that, realizing the aftermarket is a wide-ranging group of things. But I guess I would put it in just a few buckets. The mandates that you mentioned are certainly one of them, and they're beginning to lace in even though those mandates don't go in effect until 2015. People that have to accommodate that are having to manage their fleets as they go through normal C and D checks, which is logically the way they do this. We've already been in discussion with those customers. We already understand what their maintenance schedules are. And we've begun to already have production discussions on when we're going to provide that material to them. So we feel reasonably good about that kicking in as an increment. The second thing that's going on actually is the, I guess, the benefit of a very slow recovery in the business aviation market. Anytime that you're not building or buying new aircraft, you do what you do with your house, you paint it every once in a while, you get maintenance on it. And we're seeing not only that routine maintenance happen, but we're seeing some very useful upgrades to both their cockpit and their cabin systems. So we've seen a good move this past quarter, and we expect it into next year for venue solutions for cabins and Pro Line 4 to Pro Line 21 upgrades and also glass cockpit upgrades for, I'll say, aging business jets. And then the third thing are the continuation of, I'll call it, aircraft efficiency, airspace modernization moves where we see GPS-aided landing coming in. Heads-up guidance is selling very, very well as we see the safety and the efficiency inputs to that. Our synthetic vision systems are selling quite well. And as we introduce more large-format displays, people are seeing that as an efficiency mechanism as well. So I'd say all of those, many of those are new products that we're just getting into the market right now or being introduced are the things that will drive our aftermarket.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I might have missed this, but did you address broadly the bookings, the Government Systems' bookings environment in the fourth quarter, if you saw actually a slowdown or a pick up out of your government customer and the pace of booking awards?","Clayton M. Jones","I did not address that. What I would say is we did not see any dramatic, I would call, institutional slowdown, let's say, as a result of sequestration. What we saw, and what is a far more impactful than the relative lethargy of booking orders, is just the budgetary pressures causing programs to slip. I think endemic of that is the discussion I had about JTRS HMS. I mean it just took a longer time to get those kind of program gate approvals because there is not only more difficulty getting that through, there is also somewhat of a risk aversion to doing that right now. I think in this specific case, we had some testing results that came back that were a little ambiguous, and the government want to take one more look at that test, and of course, we passed with flying colors then. So I think that's sort of delaying impetus. If you look back over FY '12, I can look at about $110 million of revenue that were delayed out of the year compared to what we would have thought in our original guidance in the beginning, and all of them were just programmatically -- programmatic inefficiencies where we just didn't get things done. Some are more domestic orders, some are more international orders, like the Middle Eastern FireStorm order, which by the way, we have that order now, for those of you that are following that. But I think it's more of just the mood and the environment than there is anything that's end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just so I understand, your commercial R&D excluding deferred engineering, how much is that going to be up in fiscal '13?","Clayton M. Jones","In '13, if you look at just commercial discretionary R&D, it's up slightly, low-single digits.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then what's the -- kind of I think you said that incentive comp is going to be basically $75 million, something like that, $75 million to $80 million, that's the plan?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, roughly, yes.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then -- so last year, basically, it was negligible in the second half. As we do our modeling, should we assume it's kind of equally spread as a percent of sales?","Patrick E. Allen","I would spread it equally as a percentage of sales, I think that is the way we book it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Clay, maybe just one on the government side. This $75 million of opportunities or revenues that slid out of this quarter, is it safe to say when you constructed the guidance and put that out a couple of weeks back that, that was known? And I'm just thinking, why wasn't that bumped up into the forecast, or was that a known kind of issue already?","Clayton M. Jones","I would say a majority of that was known. For example, the 2 that I cited, that were the majority of it, were both known when we put out the guidance.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a last one. On the 787, is there any update there, or have you guys thought about when sort of your OE shipments get back more in sync with Boeing's actual production plans?","Clayton M. Jones","No update, Mike, from what I've already disclosed. And that is that we're anticipating that, that synchronization of our build-ahead inventory will occur in the second half of our year, and some of that calendarization that Patrick talked about will be impacted by what we anticipate to be an accelerating production rate on 787 as we get to the back half. So it's a kind of a front half-back half story where that's concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Patrick, I just want a little clarification on this sequential improvement in the Government Systems margins. I mean, it looks like from what we've got that maybe 80 basis points of the margin increase was due to sequentially $5 million lower R&D. And then if the incentive comp was similar in Q4 to Q3, where did you still pick up the other $15 million difference to give you the 25% margin?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I'd tell you 2 things, George. First of all, incentive comp I don't think was comparable sequentially. It was a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Probably the biggest change sequentially in addition to that would be volume. I mean, even though we were off our expectation, fourth quarter volume tends to be higher. The other thing I'd say is, if I look at the mix, particularly, after the orders that slipped out which we're largely low-margin of, say, development-related programs, the mix was richer in the fourth quarter for our Government Systems revenue.","George Shapiro","Okay. So that -- what was it -- was incentive comp maybe like $5 million in the third quarter and 0 this quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","No, it was a mild benefit to the margin sequentially, less than $5 million I think.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Clay, you've been successful in taking the 787 cockpit to a couple of applications so far. Is some of the thought that there's a broadening opportunity either in pieces or in parts for that product going forward?","Clayton M. Jones","We believe that to be the case, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Clay, at the front end of the call, you talked about a few mandates, I guess, in the retrofit area. How long do these last, this opportunity or these various opportunities? And can you quantify that in the '13 guidance? And Patrick, I'm wondering if you could parse out the $210 million, just generally, how it divides between the programs and when -- will we hear about that unannounced program next week?","Clayton M. Jones","The mandates, I think we talked about this in the past, there are 2 specific mandates both driven by European airspace. One is an upgrade to the collision avoidance system, the TCAS, they call it 7.1. The other is a data link router, Link 2000 is the name of it. Both of these mandates are already in effect for forward fit airplanes, but we really don't see that because that is a function that goes into new aircraft. But their mandate is for retrofit, in other words, the existing fleet out there, both of them by 2015. So it will be an opportunity for us between now through 2015 as we move from the early adapters to usually the surge at the end for the late adapters. It's typically the way these things go. So I would say we have a good 3-year run on these specific mandates, and I would prefer not to quantify it at this time right now, Rob, just because I don't want to do that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But it's a rising number?","Clayton M. Jones","It should be a rising number through that mandate period is the way it normally works.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So we don't have a comp issue later?","Clayton M. Jones","At least at this point in time, we shouldn't have it, as we look at '13 and '14. And then, it really depends on how it ramps into that, how many people do it.","Patrick E. Allen","And as I look at the 210 of deferred, I mentioned the 4 programs: the one we can't disclose, the 350, the Bombardier Global and the CSeries. If I look at those 4 programs, they make up the majority of that spending. And actually, they're all probably about the same, between $40 million and $50 million each.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And will we hear about that fourth one next week?","Clayton M. Jones","I'm not going to give you a timeframe for that because obviously that's dictated by our customers and our discussion with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Quick one for Patrick. I just wanted to ask you what the share repurchase assumption is in the fiscal '13 earnings guide? And then, Clay, I was -- separately, I was wondering if you might be able to elaborate on the strategy and thought process behind the management changes that were announced last month.","Patrick E. Allen","As it relates to share repurchases, we, as you know, no, I don't typically disclose the amount of our share repurchases. I can tell you that we've been pretty aggressive over the last couple of years and I don't see that changing.","Clayton M. Jones","Relative to your second question, Noah, as I've been meeting with a number of you all over the last year, there seems to be an inordinate interest in our succession program here at Rockwell Collins. I'm only suspicioning it's because of my age, but it could be something else. Anyway, I think that is better known today with the selection of Kelly Ortberg to be our President. Kelly comes with extraordinary experience, I think most of you know him running both our commercial and government business, and I would say running him through both difficult market conditions. He's really proven himself there. He's been with the company for 25 years, he's part of our system, he knows the people, he knows the product, he knows the customers. And I think he's going to do a good job as our President managing through some of these tough issues we face over the next year or so, not only ensuring that we execute the restructuring programs and all of the other operational things we have to do, but also positioning us for these development opportunities that I cited going out in '14 and beyond. So that's the reason we did it and that's who he is, and like I said, I think it suggests, as I've always said, that we have a robust succession planning program at this company, and it's beginning to manifest itself.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that the $75 million government slip was in your guidance. And yet, we're looking for down 10% each quarter. I mean, I would think now that Manpack kind of is done, GD is talking about, \"Gee, we might see a little bit of a plus in the next quarter.\" You've now gotten the FireStorm order. So isn't there any goodness? I mean, did other things slip out of the year?","Clayton M. Jones","So first thing, Cai, let me make clear what I said, I said some of it was known, not necessarily all of it was known. So again, I think the majority of that has been baked into that. I have a couple of things that we're concerned about, Cai. First of all, if it can happen this year, it can happen next year, too. And so given the environment that I talked about here, just the fact we've had some of that move into FY '13 doesn't mean that bad things aren't going to happen to good people, as we go through this very uncertain period. And so I think it's too early to start parsing either -- even a portion of that money is being incremental to the guidance or something that's happening. Let me characterize next year for Government Systems that I think is useful. If you look at the growth programs that we have, the JTRS, the FireStorm, the Tanker Program. They basically offset what the programs we've been talking about for sometime that have been a drag, the DAGR, downer, some SATCOM programs that we're focused on the OPTEMPO, Eurofighter is coming down, a number of those cancellations like Brigade Combat Team, public safety still will flow into a part of the comparability in that year. Those kind of offset each other. The biggest impact for the downer in Government Systems next year that is not sequestration-related are program transitions from research and development into production. These are the E-6, E-2 simulators, the CRIIS program, FAB-T, CH 47, are all timed to go through a sort of end of development, testing, and then we're waiting on decisions, for go-aheads, for production in the future.  As I said before, Cai, the decisions about those productions are very ambiguous now in the Pentagon, and so there's a lot of uncertainty as to when those decisions are going to be made. Although we hope they are made in FY '13. Regardless when they get made, we will see I think some growth engines be able to come in when we look at that '14 and beyond period. That's one of the reasons I have a little more confidence. If we can get through any additional impacts of sequestration or continuing resolution, we can actually see a very stable government business beyond '13. But the uncertainty, Cai, is the reason that you can't go in and say, 20 goes in here, 30 goes in here, and therefore, there's an opportunity at this point. Just too much uncertainty.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","No, I certainly agree with that. I guess the question was really focused on we have these 2 good things happen. We've had Manpack happen, we've had the FireStorm order. Presumably, they would help you in the first quarter, we don't have sequestration in the first quarter. I agree with the full year, but just that down 10% in the first quarter.","Clayton M. Jones","Well, the reason that it doesn't help us as much as you think is because originally, we would have thought we would have been into the second quarter of production there, and therefore, you would've seen an increase in production and the ramp rate. What we've done is we've taken that ramp up and just slid it to the right, if you will, as opposed to all of a sudden, there's a glut of production coming off the table, and that's what we have -- already have factored in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to just focus in on business jets and the outlook for fiscal '13 and get a sense from you on what is baked into your expectations for the year with regard to the overall market, the business jet market itself? We've had a couple of business jets OEs that have reported results since you issued your guidance, and I wanted to get a sense of whether that changes your mind at all about the outlook for fiscal '13, and how much cushion you've offered up yourself on the outlook for business jets as we move in to your next fiscal year?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, if you look -- it depends on how you look at the market. If you look at it for just business jets only, we're looking at a basically flat market in '13. We think there will be some mix in rates, but generally flat. If you add in turbos, then we think there is actually going to be growth because things like the King Airs, even Hawker Beechcraft, are actually selling quite well, and they're very economical and there's a lot of places of demand there. So if you kind of look at the range of results in business, you're looking at very low to mid single-digit growth there. And if you look at the market dynamics, they're about the same in '13 as they were in '12. You're seeing more strength in backlog at the high-end, you're seeing not much movement at the low end, and I think that's what the OEMs have been talking about here. And what everyone's waiting for is the end of uncertainty and an improving global market. Once we get that, I feel strongly that this pent-up demand and the improvement in this market will return. But it's the same thing you're hearing, whether it's business jets, whether it's construction equipment, whether it's farm equipment, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there, and I think that's stifling the relative rates of growth, and we factored about that into our next year or this year, I should say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of RBC.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible] Hawker Beechcraft, I was wondering if you could let us know if there's anything else left outstanding from Hawker Beechcraft on the balance sheet, and whether you have any expectations for Hawker moving into next year?","Patrick E. Allen","We do have a small receivable remaining from Hawker, which represents the amount we expect to collect from them. So that there is a little bit of -- there's still a little bit of exposure of Hawker Beechcraft out there.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And whether you baked any revenues from them into the FY '13?","Patrick E. Allen","Oh, yes. We've got -- I'm sorry, we've got -- we do have revenues related to the King Airline, no jets at all.","Clayton M. Jones","And if you remember, Rob, that's one of those negative comparables at the first quarter or 2, which is we did have jet production in there in '12 before they went bankrupt. We are not counting on any jet production in '13, and that's what's going to kind of dampen down the relative commercial growth in that sector in the '13 time period.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And Clay, as a follow-up, you've talked in the past about maybe some of your strategic option, whether there were any parts of your portfolio that maybe you might think of divesting or running down. Are there any changes to that?","Clayton M. Jones","Nothing that we can discuss right now, Rob. It certainly -- that's something that continues to be on our mind. We are doing careful analysis of that. We are also very mindful of timing where that's concerned. You look around the horizon, you're not seeing a lot of government defense transactions right now because of that uncertainty and the ability to define value during this period of time, but it's certainly something we continue to think about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Clay, just a one quick question. On one of your peer's calls, there was some commentary suggesting that the CR we find ourselves in is particularly onerous in its terms, and that there's a lack of really any exceptions on new starts, and that could cause some problems. Would you agree with that assessment? And is that really what's behind your earlier commentary behind even without sequestration, we could see a tough environment?","Clayton M. Jones","Carter, I guess I have not looked closely enough at the CR to be able to confirm that's my understanding of it. I'm taking it more from our past experience with extended CRs. If you remember in FY '11, we had a particularly difficult time for the 6 months CR because of the ability once that CR had cleared for them to convert that inefficiency into orders. And it's really from that experience that I'm suggesting that the natural dampening effect that any CR has relative to what you have to fund to, what new starts could happen, the fact some of those have to seek waivers to do it, just puts a great inefficiency in the system. So it's more from my experience than any of my particular knowledge of this CR.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Imperial Capital.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Clay, I wanted to ask you, just at a higher level, it's clear that you're putting some more resources into the commercial markets, you faced a little more competition at the lower end, you seemed to be certainly continuing to take share at the higher end and you are increasingly confident in your commentary around sort of the opportunities here and how you see the landscape evolving over the next few years. As you look at this opportunity, not so much for 2013, but -- because that sounds like there are some good news ahead. But 2013, '14, '15, where do you see the company in the commercial business on the original equipment side as this competitive landscape continues to evolve? And really, the bigger picture opportunity for you in this marketplace?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I hope I at least answered that in the main, in my formal comments. If I look ahead at the deliveries, new deliveries that are going to happen between 2014, let's say 2018, we know what all those are. Those are already spoken for, both in the positive and in the negative, speaking specifically of Cessna on the downside. And we've accommodated those in that sort of picture I tried to paint earlier in my optimism of the future. In my view, the opportunities and the gains far outweigh, far outweigh any losses that are perceived by the 1 OEM where we've been sort of addressing for some time. And those are what's already there. Now there will be future programs that come along the way, but they will unlikely deliver in that timeframe I just painted from '14 to '18. And so they will be beyond that window because it takes typically 4 to 5 years to develop these systems and get them into the market. And so this investment that you see, that I think Patrick talked very well about, is not going into speculative ventures. It's going into real programs that are underdeveloped now, that will hit the market during that time period and which will provide great revenue growth and market share gains to this company. Now specifically to your answer, as I alluded to, we hope in the coming months to give you a little more granularity around that, so you can kind of see the quantification of that. I'm not prepared to do that today, but that's coming to a theater near you.","Steve Buesing","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Clay, I just wanted to get a clarification from you on the Hawker situation. Is Hawker actually building any jets right now and you're just assuming 0. And then are they in fact, building King Airs right now?","Clayton M. Jones","They are, in fact, building King Airs right now, and at least to the best of my knowledge, meaning I'm not shipping them any product, they are building no jets.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And that -- and so that's how you're assuming for this fiscal '13?","Clayton M. Jones","That is correct.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

On the call this morning are Kelly Ortberg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Collins; Amin Khoury, Founder and Chairman of B\/E Aerospace; and Patrick Allen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rockwell Collins.","Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab as well as on the transaction website, www.rockwellcollins.acquisitionannouncement.com. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking.

I am very pleased to be speaking with you, today about the transformative and complementary acquisition of B\/E Aerospace. This transaction brings together two industry-leading franchises with significant benefit to Rockwell Collins.","It strengthens our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions, increasing our scale and establishing a new platform of growth for our company. The addition of B\/E will also diversify and balance our portfolio across OEM, airline and aftermarket. And as we look to the future, it enhances our ability to integrate cabin equipment using smart technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance the experience of passengers and airline personnel.","From a financial perspective, this combination is very attractive to both company's shareowners. We project run-rate pre-tax cost synergies of $160 million along with meaningful revenue synergies, which I'll discuss later in the call.","Additionally, we expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year, and combined five-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. The acquisition of B\/E Aerospace is consistent with our vision to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world.","Before I ask, Amin, to make a few comments, let me just say a few quick words about our earnings which were also announced yesterday. We had a strong quarter of operational performance highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation. This gives us a great momentum headed in 2017. Over the long-term, we're well-positioned to deliver accelerating top line revenue growth, double-digit earnings per share and strong cash flow growth.","Patrick Allen is going to discuss our fourth quarter earnings results, and our 2017 guidance later on in the call, but let me turn back to the transaction.","I'd like to thank the B\/E Aerospace's Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury for being here with me, today. As you can imagine, to put together a deal like this, we've come to know each other and our respective companies quite well. We could not have found a better partner in B\/E Aerospace, and I can tell you that on behalf of the nearly 20,000 employees at Rockwell Collins, we can't wait to bring them to the Rockwell Collins family.","Today is a big day for Amin. As Founder of B\/E, he's achieved an extraordinary feat that we should all admire from creating a small business with $3 million in revenues in 1987 to a global powerhouse of almost $3 billion, today, and a leader in the markets, all the markets that they serve, very impressive.","Congratulations, Amin. And I'd like to ask you to say a few words.","Amin J. Khoury - BE Aerospace, Inc.","Thank you, Kelly. Thank you very much for your kind remarks, but obviously it's no longer about me. It's about the wonderful benefit that this combination brings to our customers, and our employees and our shareholders.","Our combination with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B\/E Aerospace's stockholders who will receive an immediate premium, as well as a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company, broader range of products, customers and the combined expertise and resources to create real and meaningful future value.","We feel confident that this combination delivers significant long-term benefit neither company could realize on its own. We look forward to becoming part of Rockwell Collins, and leveraging their technology to accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the company's history. The opportunities available to us working together are boundless. We will truly be the premier supplier of front and back of aircraft products, and we'll build on our deep customer relationships.","For me personally, I can retire knowing that B\/E Aerospace is in Kelly Ortberg's extremely capable hands; with Werner Lieberherr continuing to run the business, while leveraging the full resources of Rockwell Collins.","This transaction delivers great benefits to all of our constituencies. Our shareholders will realize significant and immediate value in the form of a 23% current premium to B\/E's closing stock price on Friday, and expected substantial equity upside in the combined company.","Our customers will enjoy access to a greater breadth of products, technologies and a global scale in combined expertise to continue serving their evolving needs. Our employees will have greater opportunities as part of a larger, more diversified company with enhanced opportunities for professional growth and advancement across Rockwell Collins Global Platform.","Importantly, having worked with, Kelly and his team very closely throughout this process, I can assure you that Rockwell Collins and B\/E Aerospace share the same cultural values, commitment to customers, focus on innovation, quality and sustained customer value.","Rockwell Collins is acquiring a company that is in great shape. While I will not spend time on this call discussing earnings, we released our third quarter results yesterday, we recorded another outstanding quarter, and we raised guidance for 2016.","In sum, this is a tremendous opportunity for B\/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins' shareholders to participate in the long-term value-creation opportunity that neither company is able to achieve on its own.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to, Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, thanks, Amin. I'll now talk through the transaction terms on slide number four. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B\/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt.","B\/E Aerospace shareowners will receive consideration of $34.10 per share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins' common stock for each B\/E Aerospace share they own, representing a value of $62 per share, subject to a 7.5% collar. B\/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20% of Rockwell Collins following the completion of the transaction.","B\/E Aerospace will operate as a new aircraft interior systems segment within Rockwell Collins, and will continue to be run by Werner Lieberherr and B\/E's proven management team. The transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2017 upon the completion of regulatory approvals and approval of Rockwell Collins and B\/E Aerospace shareowners, as well as other customary closing conditions.","Now, turning to slide five; I want to provide a bit more detail regarding the strategic and financial rationale for this transaction. This acquisition is the result of a multi-year strategic process we undertook to determine how best to grow our company. This included the formation of a new Strategic and Financial Committee of our board. We looked at two major alternatives, one was to take our capabilities into new markets, and the other was to expand our capabilities into our current market channels. And we selected this path and developed some criteria of technical differentiation, long life cycle and market leadership.","B\/E Aerospace is a terrific match. The combination solidifies our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions. We'll be able to broaden our offerings to customers through an expansion of our traditional core business, while also strengthening and balancing our portfolio mix.","B\/E Aerospace is a leader in nearly all the markets they serve, and similar to Rockwell Collins has a reputation for innovation, quality, and on-time delivery. B\/E Aerospace also has a highly-visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new aircraft deliveries, their $12 billion of installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.","Now, I touched on the combination benefits, but let me just quickly reiterate. We expect to generate approximately $160 million in projected pre-tax run-rate cost synergies. We expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year. I believe there are meaningful revenue synergies that create significant upside to this business case. And we expect five-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. B\/E Aerospace business will fit within Rockwell Collins as a separate segment as we have successfully done with the ARINC acquisition. This will ensure no disruption to our customer commitments.","Now, in addition to the compelling financial aspects that I outlined, the deal is structured to preserve a solid investment grade rating, retain our dividend payout of approximately 25% of net income. It takes advantage of attractive credit markets and generate significantly greater value than alternative uses of capital, including share repurchases.","Moving on to slide six. For those of you who may not be as familiar with the B\/E business, I want to give you an overview of B\/E Aerospace. B\/E is a leading provider of highly-engineered aviation certified interior aircraft products. The company is a leader in all of its major product categories, and has a blue-chip customer base of airlines, commercial and biz jet OEMs, aircraft completion centers and leasing companies.","And as I've mentioned, B\/E has a high-quality backlog with multi-year visibility, and a large installed base of over $12 billion that drives aftermarket retrofit demand. The company has about 10,000 employees who directly contribute to B\/E Aerospace's success in the market, and will be a great fit at Rockwell Collins as we work together to build on a respective reputation.","Now, looking at the right-hand-side of the chart, you can see B\/E Aerospace's breakdown of 2015 revenues by customer, by market and by segment. About 80% of its revenue is from the airline customers, 60% is line fit, and 77% is within the Commercial Aircraft segment.","Now, slide seven and then eight, breakdown B\/E's business by its Commercial Aircraft segment and Business Jet segment. Let's start with the Commercial Aircraft on slide seven. You can see B\/E's four key products within this segment are seating, galley inserts, oxygen and passenger service units and interior structures. B\/E is a product line leader with strong share in first, business, and premium economy and main cabin seating, and has won 40% to 50% of the business class and main cabin awards and orders over the past two years.","B\/E is also a product line leader in food and beverage preparation and storage equipment referred to as galley inserts. And they have won 85% of the galley insert awards and orders over the past two years. They are the supplier of passenger oxygen systems for all Airbus and Boeing platforms currently in production. And finally, B\/E is the supplier of Spacewall modular lavatory systems for the Boeing 737 aircraft.","Turning now to slide eight, let's take a look at B\/E's Business Jet segment. Key products within this segment are super first class suite, business jet seating and interior lighting systems. B\/E is a product line leader in bespoke customer (sic) [custom] super first class cabins, there they were recently awarded a $260 million program for high-end suites, which sets a new industry standard. And they have won more than 75% of super first class awards over the past couple of years.","The company is a product line leader in all major seating categories including business jet, VIP aircraft and civilian helicopters. It is the sole source for Boeing 737 and Boeing 737 MAX cabin lighting and does retrofit lighting on a number of aircraft as well.","Turning now to slide nine. You can see the impressive combination of Rockwell Collins and B\/E Aerospace offering in the cockpit, cabin and aircraft exterior. The transaction broadens our portfolio with leading products in attractive segments that strengthens and broadens our airline relationships. With the addition of these capabilities, Rockwell Collins will have an increased ability to provide integrated offerings throughout the aircraft.","Turning now to slide 10, as you can see the company will be more diversified, and in different ways than we are today. The combined company will have greater presence in the commercial air transport market. This will strengthen our aftermarket mix with more retrofit opportunities. And you can see in the diagram, our customer mix will be nicely balanced between U.S. and international. This transaction creates more resilient and diversified business with greater earnings power and reduced volatility.","So, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to, Patrick Allen, and he's going to discuss the combined company's financial highlights. Patrick?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ended September 30, 2016.","Both companies announced earnings' results yesterday, so these are current numbers, and did not reflect synergies and the combined earnings power of the two companies, which together we expect will create significantly even greater value in the future.","Let's turn to slide 12, and talk about some of those synergies. The transaction is expected to generate run-rate pre-tax cost synergies of approximately $160 million, which translates to $125 million after-tax due to some of the synergies coming from favorable tax jurisdictions.","In addition, we expect to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments which will benefit earnings by $60 million to $90 million per year for about six years. The sources of the cost synergies will come from elimination of duplicate, public company costs and headquarters consolidation, low cost country manufacturing, supply chain savings, consolidation of IT systems and rationalization of our sales and customer support organization.","We've a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies as you saw with our ARINC acquisition. And we've established a very clear path to realizing these savings. Additionally, significant revenue synergies exists, which Kelly will talk about in more detail, but are not included and represent upside to our business case. The cost to achieve these synergies is about $120 million, the bulk of which will be incurred over the next three years.","Slide 13 provides some additional color about our near-term capital deployment. As always, we will continue to invest in organic growth. We will continue investing in research and development, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales of the combined organization.","We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage, and we expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3x within two years. We plan to structure our financing with $1.5 billion three-year pre-payable term loan to facilitate this plan. And we remain focused on shareholder return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income.","We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. And we are committed to maintaining strong liquidity and flexibility and preserving an investment grade rating, which we currently expect to be a solid BBB.","Now, let me quickly summarize our earning results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 on the following slides. Turning to slide 15, we reported a strong Q4 with revenue of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year.","EPS from continuing operations of $1.58, a 14% increase compared to last year, and income from continuing operations of $208 million, a 13% increase. Our Government Systems business posted its first full-year of growth in six years and closed out the year with fourth quarter sales growth of 14%, and its highest-ever quarterly operating margin.","We continue to see growth in our IMS segment in both the aviation and non-aviation businesses. Commercial Systems air transport aviation electronics portfolio delivered a solid quarter of growth in OEM and aftermarket sales, while the business and regional aviation electronics portfolio continue to see weakness from the challenging business jet market conditions. Our diluted average shares outstanding decreased from $133 million to $131 million due to our share repurchase program.","Now, turning to slide 16, I'd like to review briefly our full-year 2016 results. We reported 2016 revenue of $5.3 billion, approximately flat year-over-year. EPS from continuing operations of $5.50; a 6% increase compared to last year. Income from continuing operations of $727 million, a 5% increase and operating cash flow from continuing operations of $723 million, which is down 3% year-over-year. We are pretty pleased with these results in light of the challenging business jet marketing conditions.","Now, turning to slide 17, I'll walk you through the guidance for 2017. Importantly, this is just for Rockwell Collins' base business. It does not include any impact from our acquisition of B\/E Aerospace, which again we plan to close in the spring of 2017. We will update guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing at close.","With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This replaced Government Systems sales growing low to mid-single-digits, an accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat as benefits from market share gains in air transport offset further declines in biz jet OE revenues. And we expect Information Management Services to be up mid to high-single-digits.","Our total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $800 million and $900 million. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million resulting in free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to between $900 million and $950 million, and our full-year income tax rate will be between 28% and 29%.","Yesterday, B\/E also reported results for the three and nine months ended September 30. As reflected in the release, the company reported strong sales and earnings growth, and continues to build momentum going to 2017.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to, Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Now, I want to walk through what, I think, could be the most exciting long-term benefits of the combination of the two companies, and that's our revenue synergies.","As I said before, these all represent upside to our business case. And we see five major areas of synergy. First area, I'll talk about is the business aviation aftermarket.","It will be a prime area of focus for us with more than 20,000 jets we can offer a full complementary of interiors from seating to lighting to electronics, while aircrafts are undergoing avionics modifications. And depending on the size of the aircraft, we could easily see between $200,000 to well over $1 million of opportunity per aircraft.","Rockwell Collins' position on many military aircraft program gives us an important access to customers, and this acquisition will allow us a broader offering to those customers. This is a channel that B\/E currently just doesn't serve.","Rockwell Collins has stronger OEM relationships, and that will aid further growth for standard interior sales. And likewise, B\/E has stronger airline relationships that we think would generate opportunities for Rockwell Collins to sell more avionics or likewise opportunities where Rockwell Collins has strength to sell more interior equipment. If you think about that, these opportunities represent well over $50 million per opportunity.","And finally, as you think about the transition to the next integrated digital airplane, perhaps, most exciting synergy is our combined portfolio will uniquely position us to integrate cabin products, smart network technologies, and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft uptime and airline profitability.","In summary, we are thrilled about this acquisition and the opportunities it provides to both company's shareowners.","Together, our company will be a leading supplier with platforms for accelerated growth in new products and markets.","The transaction is financially compelling and will allow a significant cost savings, and will deliver significantly greater value to our stakeholders than either company could on its own; customers, employees, suppliers, and shareowners will all benefit from this exciting combination.","And I'll finish by adding my complements to Amin and his team, who've done a tremendous job of building a leading franchise, and creating value at B\/E. We're eager to welcome the talented B\/E Aerospace employees and look forward to continuing to grow our business together.","So, let me turn the call back over to, Ryan, and we'll begin the Q&A.","Ryan D. Miller - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you, Kelly. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue, and we'll answer those additional questions if time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Rob.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Congratulations on your agreement.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thank you. Very excited about it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I wanted to ask on \u2013 Kelly, you just talked about the revenue synergies, and you noted about $1 million to $2 million in upside per biz jet, I think it was. How would you characterize that in a percentage upside from your current combined revenue? And then the same question for commercial aircraft?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, what I said, Rob, was that depending on the size of the aircraft, we could see between $200,000 to well over $1 million per...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm sorry.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","...and let me just explore that opportunity a little bit more to define what that is. Today, when aircraft come in for maintenance actions, that's when we typically will sell them avionics mods or even cabin entertainment equipment mods and updates. And we do that through our pretty expansive dealer network. We've got over 300 dealers in the business aviation channel that help us do that.","B\/E currently doesn't have a dealer network, and in many cases, they don't have visibility to know those aircrafts are coming in for mods and upgrades or maintenance actions. And so, there's no point of sale for the interior products to let those customers know what the latest and greatest capabilities are.","And as you can imagine, most of these customers are looking for some of the latest features and amenities that would go in the cabin. And we think, it's going to be a great opportunity for us when we know these folks are coming in for maintenance actions. Their aircrafts are going to be down for either a modification to the cabin systems or an avionics or even an engine overhaul. We can then upsell the cabin interiors to that. So as I look at that, I think that can have a meaningful increase, but almost double our opportunities as we do discretionary mods to \u2013 with our current avionics portfolio, so that's a...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Double your avionics content or double the current combined content for the two of you?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","...it could double our current avionics content on a per aircraft mod basis. So, if you look at our aftermarket...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","...a portion of that is mandate-driven, a portion of that is discretionary mods. I think this can provide a meaningful update to that end market.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then on a typical commercial aircraft, if you took Collins' content with B\/E Aerospace's, do you have thoughts on how much that could rise?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. So let me give you a couple of figures of merit, because I think they are important as you think about that synergies. If you look at our content on the next-generation wide-body aircraft, if we combine B\/E's content, it will triple our position, our content on programs like the 787, the A350, which we know are going to drive the preponderance of the future wide-body market, and it will nearly double our position in the narrow-bodies.","There are airline customers where B\/E is extremely strong. We're not so strong, so there's opportunities for us with that expanded footprint to pull some avionics opportunities. And likewise, there are airline customers where they are not as strong, but we do have strong avionics positions that we could provide a broader offering to those customers.","And I think, if you think about that as I talked in my prepared remarks, that's probably about a $50 million-plus opportunity per major BFE selection or aircraft selection; probably more opportunity for the interiors than pulling the avionics because of the relatively larger content that B\/E has on an aircraft, but significant opportunities.","And you know that's something that we've actually already seen with our ARINC acquisition, where there were airlines that they had a much stronger position with some of their services, and it just gave us access to better understand the needs and the demands of those customers. And we've been able to pick up some share by doing that.","So I think, that's pretty exciting, and I will tell you, it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part. It's mostly channel management. We're talking about the existing product lines of both companies, so it's great upside for us. And we'll probably be able to prosecute those things pretty quickly.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, just to clarify, can you put that $50 million in percentage terms?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Percentage of what?","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Content increase. So B\/E today plus Collins today, after revenue synergies tomorrow?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, I haven't looked at it that way, Rob. I'd probably not answer that question right now. I think, you ought to think of it in terms of \u2013 if we pick up three to five customers per year, I gave you the per airplane content. That can give you a good way to think about it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone; and echo Rob's comments, congratulations everyone.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Kelly, I guess, maybe most importantly for me is just, could you focus on the, kind of the synergy roadmap on the cost side, kind of you're spending $120 million to kind of achieve that. But how should we think about that in terms of just kind of how that rolls through over the next couple of years. Just basically some of your thoughts on that would be appreciated?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Sure, Peter. Well, first of all, we're going to see those revenue synergies come pretty quickly. We expect 90% of that $160 million to be achieved by our second full fiscal year, which is our fiscal 2019.","And let me give you the four, what I'll say, major financial drivers to those cost synergies, and it will give you a perspective of the timing. The first is eliminating the duplicate public company costs and headquarters that Patrick outlined. That comes right away. That's pretty quick synergy, and that is pretty straightforward as you can imagine in a transaction like this.","The second area is in supply chain savings both direct supply chain where we're buying materials that go in our end products, as well as indirect where we're buying either consumables or things that we use, as well as services that we both buy externally. We think those savings are going to come pretty quickly as well. We've already got a detailed list of our supply chain overlap, where we expect to see synergies, and we based our synergies on previous supply chain consolidation that we've done.","So I think that's pretty straightforward. And again, that will happen pretty quickly. We've got a plan that we'll be able to hit the ground running on those supply chain synergies.","The third area is consolidation of our IT systems, and especially our manufacturing ERP system. And we'll start that right away, but that will happen on a \u2013 really a plant-by-plant basis. So that will feather in over time. The first plants will obviously provide the synergies faster, and that will come in over the first three years to four years.","And then last area is leveraging our low-cost country manufacturing and engineering capability. The engineering side is mostly around design centers in India. We both have India design centers in Hyderabad, which will give us opportunity to have some consolidation, but also further leverage that IDC, India Design Center for low-cost engineering.","And then, as you can imagine, global companies like ours are continually looking at where and how we build our products and how we do that in the most efficient manner. Those will take a little bit more time as we shift to some low-cost country manufacturing.","So, I'd say, kind of up-front, you're going to see the elimination of the public costs, supply chain, start of the IT consolidation, and then, over time, the full IT consolidation, and the low-cost country manufacturing and engineering will drive those synergies.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate that.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Now, we've got several others. But I would say, these are the four meaningful areas of cost synergy.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Kelly, for the color.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hey, Myles. Good morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Kelly, a common question I'm getting, I'll give you a chance to answer it. How do you get comfortable or how do you make investors comfortable that, this largest deal you're doing in the company's history, eight years removed from the (35:52), really, the last significant correction in the Commercial Aerospace segment is the right time to be doing this, and in your level of confidence, and in that Commercial Aerospace segments staying strong for the next couple of years, next, a long time, more than couple of years, and doing the deal now?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good question, Myles. It's something that we spend a lot of time analyzing as a part of the \u2013 our decision, here. First of all, let me just say, this is a through-cycle acquisition. We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth.","B\/E's business is much more driven to air traffic growth and airline profitability than what I'll say our core Rockwell Collins business is, which is more geared towards the cyclicality of OEM production. I really like that. I think this acquisition actually balances us and provides us opportunities to go into the retrofit market.","As you know, when aircraft OEMs lower aircraft production rate, the airlines will then look to upgrade their existing aircraft. And I believe, we're coming into a major cycle where a lot of wide-bodies are coming off-lease and will be returned to the lessors.","And with that, we're going to see great opportunities for retrofit of the cabins, because these systems, when the aircraft come back to the lessors, they need to be reconfigured for the new airlines that they're going to. That's just an opportunity we really don't see in our core business, so I really like the nature of the aftermarket revenues here.","The other thing I'll say is we're both well-positioned on the wide-bodies that are going to drive the growth with the A350 and the 787. We have in this plan taken a hard look at the overall cycle of the legacy wide-bodies, factored that into our outlook. I'll also say that we did extraordinarily deep due diligence on the B\/E backlog. It's very robust.","And I think that, we feel very comfortable that this acquisition is going to manage its way through what will be a \u2013 we will see some softness, no question, in wide-body in near-term, but there's also no question for the long-run to deliver the traffic growth, you have to have wide-body aircraft. And for the long-run, this acquisition will create a lot of value for us.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And Patrick, what is the net deal amortization for the deal in the first year you own it, inclusive of that $60 million to $90 million purchase accounting benefit?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 Myles, we're still working on the intangible valuation. So, I don't want to commit to a specific number, but rest assured it's both the reduction in the engineering amortization and the amortization of intangibles are included in the accretion numbers that, Kelly, indicated.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you and congratulations. To follow up on Myles' question, you've said 10% double-digit accretion in fiscal 2018. So obviously, you must've had some assumptions regarding that amortization, and some assumptions regarding what does include of the $120 million of kind of integration cost, and some assumptions about the number of shares that you issued. Could you just walk us through the assumptions that get us to double-digits?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, double-digits is a pretty wide range of potential outcome. One of the things we need to do over the course of the next few months, Cai, is do things like the purchase accounting valuation that arrives at the precise intangible asset amortization. I would tell you that one of the assumptions we made in terms of interest rates is 3% to 3.5% interest rates, I think, is a pretty reasonable assumption, today. And we've made that assumption. In terms of fleshing out some of the more detailed calculations, I prefer to get farther down the line in terms of the valuation of the intangible assets of B\/E.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","But I mean, you've made a statement of 10%. So even if we take the lower-end of that, you must've had some assumptions regarding, are we going to be at the upper or the lower end of the collar on the share count, and those sorts of things. So, just if you could get us the assumptions to get to the low-end of the double-digits?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","We assumed in our analysis that there wouldn't be any adjustment to the collar; in other words, that the share price would be unaffected. So there is some variation around that. I want to say, it's probably a couple of points of accretion going either way.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. I want to just be clear on the double-digit accretion. Does that include the effect of all of the synergies, I mean, or by fiscal 2018 you won't have, you say, 90% within a couple of years. So how much of the synergies is included in that double-digit?","And then on the $60 million to $90 million benefit, I assume that the $60 million, the low-end is what you see over the year or two. So if you could just mention what those specifics were for the double-digit accretion?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. George, you're absolutely right. The 2018 numbers assume \u2013 think of it as a GAAP accretion number relative to what Rockwell Collins would be on a standalone basis. It includes a share of the synergies, so we'll be accelerating from 2018 to 2019 as the synergies lay in, as Kelly had indicated. So, we'll have a portion of the synergies. And also, that amortization starts around $60 million a year. Think of it as $60 million in 2018, which is our first full fiscal year, rising to $90 million over the planning period.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'll stick with the one question.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Carter.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wondered if you could back up to some of the early comments you made on the transaction, Kelly, related to the multi-year strategic review that you said had been underway. I just \u2013 we hadn't heard about that before. I wonder has it helped shape the decision to do this transaction? What did that reveal in terms of growth or profitability or particular challenges or opportunities? What was it about that look at your business that said, this is where we need to go to address X or Y? Any color you can help us with there would be appreciated.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. Well, the only thing I'd say is, it was a look at how to optimize as opposed to a defensive, any kind of a defensive maneuver. But clearly, there's some things that as you look at our core business that's factored into our thinking, one is that we now have all the cockpits on Boeing's next-generation aircraft, which is providing us great growth between now and when the 777X comes in. But at that point, we aren't going to have as many opportunities to gain share as we already have 100% of that particular market share. Now, there will be some new airplanes, but to continue at the growth rate, we feel we needed a broader portfolio of offerings.","Another factor is the business aviation OEM environment as we all know, and we've seen over the last several years is, it's questionable when that end market is going to recover. And I don't think, as I look at our core business, that we can be assured that that's going to be a growth engine for us going forward.","Now, we're not going to get out of that business. It's very important. We have to get a lot of leverage across our other end markets. We use common product lines; it's a technology incubator for a lot of what we do. But again, as I look at how we're going to optimize the growth of the company, we felt we needed to have more opportunities to do that.","So, we did look at those two alternatives I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think, one of the things about Rockwell Collins, while we've got a great technology base, if you talk to customers about what separates us in the marketplace is the relationship. They know we'll do what we say we're going to do. They trust us. They know we're going to support them and their customers in their long-term business opportunity. So we felt leveraging that capability was the best way to go, and looking at how to broaden our portfolio.","And as I mentioned, one of the important criterias of making sure as we're broadening that portfolio, we broaden that with someone who, first of all, understands that portfolio, is well-positioned in the market, has enough scope and scale that we're assured success. And B\/E is just a great fit with all of their product lines being top in the market, well-established. Look, this is not a \u2013 they don't need fix-up from Rockwell Collins. This is a well-run business with well-respected positions.","But they're also at a time where they're being challenged by the customers to provide more, what I'll say, smart implementation of their equipment. You can kind of think of the future airplane that all of the galley equipment is going to need to be a node on the network to either provide a better passenger experience, to allow the crew to interact differently with the passengers or for improved maintenance actions. And they're being pressed by their customers to bring up smart devices, smart cabin interior devices that integrate that capability. They don't have that, we do. We don't have the products, they do. So it's a really nice fit for us.","And I think, we're going to be uniquely positioned to work with both the airlines and the OEMs to help shape that and provide a more efficient, effective interior market for them going forward. So, I see a lot of good things about this opportunity here, today.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Kelly. I'll stick to the one.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for your time. Just in terms of the transaction and some of the comments you made earlier, can you just talk about how you're shifting your business mix a bit going more towards commercial versus defense? Is that something that you're doing deliberately, or is this more of an opportunistic type transaction? And I asked it for the obvious reasons as sort of investors seem to prefer more sort of safer business just on the defense versus that commercial side? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, there's no question we have historically been more balanced between commercial and military market, and this shifts that balance more towards commercial. Having said that, I do believe there's opportunities for us to grow this portfolio in the military market. So I'm pretty excited about those opportunities.","If you think about Rockwell Collins, we actually do a lot of work in the cabins of military aircraft. It's mostly mission systems equipment that we put in, either air refueling, signals intelligence, communications, networks, those types of things. But all those aircrafts when they're getting modified, all the interior systems are needed and are being modified.","So I think that the business will present some significant opportunities for us to grow the military market. And as that business recovers, we'll see some increased shift back to a little bit more balance there.","I don't have a view that we need to stay 50\/50 commercial and defense. I think that the mix and the balance is much more important at the product line that you need to have the scope and scale there to compete effectively at the product line. And so, I feel quite comfortable with the overall mix shift here going forward. And as I said in my other remark, we are absolutely a believer that air traffic is going to continue to grow at that 4% to 6% historical growth rate.","And so, while I'm sure there will be OEM fluctuations through that, in the long run, in order to deliver that traffic growth, there needs to be aircraft interiors and seats and all the things to deliver that. So, I feel very comfortable with this move. And I think, it diversifies us, as I said, with much more aftermarket opportunities.","I really like the fact that the interiors get modified multiple times in the life of an aircraft. Our avionics typically don't, other than mandate updates, they tend to stay on wing through the full life of the airplanes. So this really gives us a lot more retrofit opportunities, which when the OEM rates are being perturbated (50:18), it gives us other areas to offset that.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks for the time and congrats.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, David. Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, congratulations. So, you've talked this double-digit accretion. It sounds like it's off of whatever you were expecting for fiscal 2018 on a stand-alone basis. I guess, just to level set us, can you help us what you were actually expecting? I think you've previously been talking about double-digit EPS growth, but if you could just level set us there. And then just quickly on your guidance, the Commercial Systems guidance of flat, a little bit worse than what I was expecting even with business jets being weak. Can you kind of break out the individual components there? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Let me hit the top line guide, and then I'll ask Pat, to come back on the EPS accretion. If you look at our biz jet OEM revenues for fiscal 2017, they're actually going to be down a little bit more than the OEM's production rates that you're probably basing your outlook on.","There's a pretty significant amount of inventory in the system that's going to be fleshed out. So we are going to see significant declines year-on-year again in our OEM revenues, that's going to essentially offset the growth that we have in air transport. And then the other factor is that, we've seen all year the parts recycling in the aftermarket \u2013 air transport aftermarket, and we factor that in and expect our overall aftermarket to be relatively flat because of that phenomenon.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","And as it relates to the accretion, dilution question, I'm going to give you a total unsatisfactory answer, I think David but, it is correct that your \u2013 it is the accretion over what we otherwise would be planning as a standalone company. However, we don't typically give individual years out beyond that you were looking at. So I think it's fair to say that we would anticipate growth in the business, but I'm not going to get more specific than that.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, Kelly, on business jets, just to follow up, are you thinking business jets down 15%, 20% for you in 2017, business jet OE?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, the biz jet OE will be \u2013 but as we reported, it also has regionals. So we'll see some offsetting regionals. So, I'd say down high-single-digit for the combination.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Kelly, just help me get my head around this. This is the part that I don't understand; in terms of the diversification strategy, it seems like a bit of a barbell, at least from a technology point of view, right? When I think about Collins and its core strength in communications and electronics and all that, the really cool stuff you do, how do I sort that out with stepping down the technology ladder, and doing seats, coffee makers, toilets? I mean, I'm having a hard time understanding that?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah, Ron. Well, first of all, let me just say that, I think you underestimate the complexity, the amount of engineering that goes into these pieces of equipment. It's highly engineered, as I mentioned. The whole certification process is extraordinarily complex. And I'd just say go look at how many people are in the markets in these particular commodities, it's a big barrier to entry. So I think your thought that this is not complex is probably a little bit off.","I would also say that, they have historically been standalone systems. There's no question that what we do has more software control content in it than what B\/E does today. But I see that as a great opportunity, because that's going to shift over time. Everything is going to become a smart device. We're going to be embedded microprocessors in everything. We're going to be embedding software and software applications across the airplane. I think this is a great opportunity for us to bring these portfolios together and seize that transformation that's going to happen in the market.","So I think, if you look five years, six years ahead, you'll see that this is a much different looking product line with sensors, embedded sensors, controls, Wi-Fi interfaces, secured networks throughout the airplane. Those are all the expertises that Rockwell Collins has, and it's going to bring to the excellent product line that B\/E has.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just if I can push back a little bit on one point. Travelling around and visiting a bunch of the air shows at different places in the world, the one area where it does seem there is some traction in the supply chain, for example, in China, would be overhead bins and seats and IFE, right? I mean, it just doesn't seem like the barriers to entry in those markets are as severe as they are in your core electronics market. So, I mean, maybe, I'm understanding that wrong, but it just doesn't seem that way at first glance.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Well, I think you got to go look at the respective market shares by product lines. And there's no question that B\/E has a very high market share, a very high win rate in competitions as they're competing for these products and services, and there are not that many competitors.","So I think, we feel very comfortable that this product line, it's highly-differentiated, highly-engineered and create significant barriers to entry for commoditization. These are not commodities in the \u2013 particularly in the front of the aircraft. This is what differentiates the airlines from one another and they take these things very, very seriously. And again, I think we'll be able to bring technical capability to B\/E's product line in a way that will even further differentiate us going forward.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Well, thank you for answering the questions here. Have a good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Well, thank you very much. Just a couple of high-level deal questions. Can you talk about the break-up fee and some of the regulatory challenges, what agencies do you need to see? And how did you arrive at the spring date? It seems reasonable, but just want to check?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. So, we don't anticipate any regulatory challenges, but we do have to go through all the regulatory filings. And because of the global nature of our respective companies, we have those filings in a lot of different jurisdictions. We think probably China's approval would just be the long pole in the tent. From an administrative perspective, we don't anticipate any issues there. We've picked spring of 2017; I think that's probably reasonable. I will tell you, if we get through that a little faster, then we'll be ready to go as soon as we get those regulatory approvals going forward.","The break-up fees are \u2013 is structured where, if B\/E board which has unanimously approved the deal as has Rockwell Collins board. But if they would change their recommendation to approve the deal, then they would have to pay $200 million of break-up fee. And likewise, if Rockwell Collins board changed their approval or recommendation, then we would pay $300 million of break-up fee.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","I mean then, Kelly, one last item. It stood out in your earnings that you had a notable uptick in some classified business; while I don't want to ask what that is, I'd like to find out whether it's recurring in any nature or can you elaborate on that degree?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yes, it's recurring for long-term.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Ryan D. Miller - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our last question today, comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Kelly, if I can just follow-up on the whole discussion around the digital aircraft that you're saying in terms of nodes on the network. Is this a new area of development that we should expect to see, and can you discuss really what the trajectory, what that means in terms of R&D, both customer and company-funded over the next few years in the combined company?","Kelly Ortberg - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think you're going to see us shift our overall combined company R&D focus. What separates us and what separates B\/E is the fact that we both invest heavily in technology and next-generation product lines, so we're not going to stop that in any way, shape or form.","B\/E is already underway in some areas of their product line moving to the wide-body interface and the smart device and embedding sensors in there, so this is here now. They need some capability, help around integrating that system, creating the applications. We do the secure firewalls, the onboard routers, switches, wireless distribution on the aircraft, so I think we can bring a lot of capability to help accelerate the product line implementation of the smart technology.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick one, Patrick, what is the assumption in terms of pre-production engineering change in fiscal 2017 that's embedded in the guidance?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","The pre-production engineering change is about $25 million on a net basis.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Up or down?","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Up.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Patrick E. Allen - Rockwell Collins, Inc.","Sorry. Down.","Samuel J.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Bonnie, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today at our website at www.rockwellcollins.com, under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note that today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation, and from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody.","Of the 3 primary markets we address, government, air transports and business jets, 2 of them have followed a relatively predictable course so far this year. We felt government was going to be weak and following a decline in first half with growth in the second half. Results this quarter indicate that's exactly what's happened. We forecast its strong growth in the air transport sectors, Boeing and Airbus increased production rates, no backlog. And despite a slower aftermarket growth this quarter, air transport is up across the board in double-digits for the year-to-date. However, the market that has proven to be the most unpredictable for a variety of reasons is business jets. Our original guidance for Commercial Systems at the beginning of the year was low double-digit growth. We now expect high single-digit growth with all of the reduction resulting from the Hawker Beechcraft bankruptcy and the slowdown in the business jet aftermarket. Neither of which was expected when we set guidance for the year last September.","Most of this market is in a recovery mode. And we continue to expect deliveries -- increased deliveries at all of the OEMs except Hawker. That said, the recovery is not as robust as we and the OEMs thought it would be at this point, which I believe is a reflection of the state of the global economy. This has had a particularly significant impact at the light end of the market where OEMs are still struggling to fill orders and build backlog. As a result, we are revising our guidance for the year to reflect the updated realities of this market. First, we are lowering our cash flow from operations to about $600 million due to lower collections of accounts receivable from Hawker Beechcraft and higher expected tax payments. Second, we're revising our revenue guidance to about $4.8 billion, which incorporates the updated outlook for business jets. This includes a $25 million reduction to OEM revenue for the Hawker Beechcraft temporary production shutdown and revised build rate, which I disclosed earlier this quarter, and lower expectations for aftermarket growth by $25 million, driven by a slower global economic recovery that has limited discretionary spending and business jet utilization.","Even with those revisions to revenue, we continue to forecast completing the year within our original EPS guidance range but have narrowed our expectations toward the lower end of that range to $4.40 to $4.50 per share. I should note that I am very pleased with how our company has managed things within our control and taken appropriate actions to maintain this high level of profitability.","As you can see in our Commercial Systems results, much of the impact that led to revised guidance I just discussed was realized in the third fiscal quarter. However, to give you a better look in context of our ongoing Commercial Systems business, if I exclude from our revenue, the impacts of the Hawker bankruptcy and some onetime benefits we experienced last year, Commercial Systems would have experienced high single-digit revenue growth this quarter. That level of growth is the same as the second quarter and similar to what we expect in the fourth quarter.","By now, you've all had a chance to review our press release, so I'll let Patrick cover the details of the third quarter results in just a few minutes. However, I do want to point out a few key aspects of the quarter that I think are particularly noteworthy.","In Government Systems, some of the headwinds affecting our first half results have diminished and we're now beginning to see the benefits of previous market share gains. Avionics grew 11% this quarter, on the strength of the 3 Tanker Programs we captured last year, the KC-46, the KC-10 and the KC-390, as well as increased revenue from Saudi F-15 fighters.","We've had great success over the past couple of years, winning positions and are now beginning to drive some meaningful growth in this business. Additionally, we saw a 9% increase in Communications Products based on increased deliveries of our networking and data link products.","Another notable aspect of our results this quarter was strengthening growth in our air transport OEM sales, which increased 19%. Finally, I would note that despite modest sales growth, we expanded total corporate operating margins by 20 basis points to 21%, and reported Government Systems margins above 20% for the 15th consecutive quarter. The previous 4 of which had negative revenue growth.","Over time, I believe we have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver strong operating performance by managing our cost structure in the face of some very dynamic market conditions.","Now as we begin to look forward to 2013, I expect many of the difficult market conditions we've experienced recently to continue.","For Government Systems, the threat of sequestration has created uncertainty and will challenge our ability to accurately forecast the market and our performance in it. In any case, we fully expect U.S. Defense investment budgets to continue declining next year. While defense will slow in the U.S., numerous international opportunities exist and should become an increasing contributor to the business. This includes recent wins on the KC-390 transport in Brazil, the F-15 fighters in Saudi Arabia, and just this quarter, we expanded our FireStorm product in Australia, with a $70 million contract award.","In Commercial Systems, we're forecasting double-digit growth over the longer term, but that growth will not be linear. Next year, we expect the air transport market to remain strong, with additional production rate increases. However, for the 787 program, it's important to remind everyone that we will be delivering at a rate of 4 ship sets per month well into next year. As Boeing increases their production rates, they will begin to burn off existing inventory of our products and eventually synchronize our deliveries to their rates. We just don't expect that to happen until the latter part of next year.","The business jet market has been difficult to predict and any recovery next year will be dependent on the trajectory of the global economy. Over the past few years, we've had a number of market share gains, which have provided above market rates of growth to offset the false starts in the economic recovery we've experienced the last couple of years. As I look into next year, there are no new aircraft entering service that will materially drive revenue growth above the market rate of growth. However, beyond 2013, the benefits of market share gains should, again, contribute and allow us to grow at beyond market rates.","Commercial Systems aftermarket will again benefit from demand for spares as airlines take initial deliveries of the 787. All of the growth will be a bit less now that we have this year's deliveries in the base. The remainder of the aftermarket will be highly dependent on the pace of economic recovery, which drive discretionary purchases and increased aircraft utilization. This is likely to be as difficult to predict next year as it's been for the previous 3.","While it's a sober picture in the near term, there is a lot to get excited about when I look just a bit further out. We have the ramp of 787 deliveries, which will substantially benefit our business, followed by the entry into the service of the A350 and the CSeries. The 2 new international jets, the MRJ and the ARJ21  will bring new products to the Regional Jet segment over the next few years. And finally, we have the continuation of our business jet market share capture as the Embraer 500 and 450, the Lear 85 and the Global 7000 and 8000 of Bombardier enter into service. With any stabilization in our government business along the way, which I believe will happen, Rockwell Collins is very well-positioned to generate strong revenue, profit and cash flow performance. Meanwhile, we will remain focused on operating our business as efficiently as possible, generating high returns on invested capital and position the company and its share owners for future success.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay, and good morning to everyone as well.","Let's get started by first reviewing our results for the total company that are shown on Slides 3 and 4.","Total company sales for the quarter came in at $1.21 billion, a 1% increase from last year. Income and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% and 13%, respectively. The greater increase in earnings per share when compared with net income was due to the share repurchases.","Income from continuing operations included a $7 million benefit from lower tax rate, primarily driven by the remeasurement of certain tax reserves. This benefit only partially offsets the adverse impacts from the Hawker Beechcraft bankruptcy and temporary production shutdown which totaled $8 million after tax. The increased operating performance this quarter was mostly due to continued strength in the air transport OEM deliveries and lower discretionary spending in Government Systems.","Turning to Slides 5 and 6, we have the third quarter results of our Commercial Systems business which reported revenues of $526 million, up 1% from the second quarter last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $10 million or 4%, to $295 million, driven by increased sales to Boeing and Airbus resulting from higher production rates across their product lines, partially offset by lower deliveries to Hawker Beechcraft due to a temporary production shutdown.","Aftermarket sales declined $1 million to $208 million, driven by lower spare sales which tend to be lumpy across the year.","Commercial Systems operating earnings decreased to $105 million or 20% of sales compared to the  operating earnings of $107 million or 20.5% of sales in the third quarter last year. The decrease in operating earnings is primarily due to a bad debt charge related to the bankruptcy at Hawker Beechcraft.","On Slide 7, Government Systems revenue grew 2% this quarter to $679 million. Avionics sales increased $40 million or 11%, to $393 million from increased sales for Saudi F-15 fighters, and the KC-46, KC-10 and KC-390 Tanker programs. Sales in communication products were also strong, with an increase of 9% to $178 million due to increased sales of network communication and data link products.","Surface Solutions sales decreased 39% to $50 million, principally driven by 2 programs which were previously terminated for convenience, also, lower sales on the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System or JPALS program as it transitions for development to production, and reduced deliveries of optical products for surface-based programs.","Finally, Navigation Products sales were down 16% to $58 million, driven by fewer deliveries of our GPS receivers.","Slide 8 shows Government Systems third quarter operating earnings which were $148 million or 21.8% of sales compared to $141 million or 21.1% last year. The improved operating performance is primarily due to lower discretionary spending, partially offset by the absence of favorable warranty reserve adjustment recorded last year. Additionally, a less favorable hardware sales mix offset a $6 million benefit from a favorable EAC adjustment.","On Slide 9, we have our 9-month year-to-date total company financial results for sales, EPS from continuing operations, income from continuing operations and operating cash flow. So far this year, sales have decreased by 1% as the headwinds in Government Systems have been mostly offset with growth in Commercial Systems. Our year-to-date operating cash flow of $192 million is behind last year due to increased payments for employee incentive compensation and higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher receipts for customer advances.","Moving to Slide 10, we show the status of our capital structure. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $778 million of long-term debt and $201 million of short-term debt outstanding compared to $528 million of long-term debt at the end of fiscal 2011. We believe our debt to total capital ratio of 43%, in combination with our investment-grade credit ratings, provides us access to liquidity in a cost-effective manner.","If you turn to Slide 11, we provide details related to the updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock at an average cost of $52.24 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to 76 million shares or $3.7 billion return to share owners through maintaining an active share repurchase program. Additionally, the Board of Directors recently approved an incremental $500 million increase to the share repurchase authorization. That brings our currently available authorization up to $502 million. In addition to returning capital to share owners through share repurchases, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.30 per share.","Now onto our final slide, Slide 12, where we provide the details of our updated fiscal year 2012 financial guidance. As Clay mentioned in his opening remarks, we have made some revisions and tightened our guidance ranges. We now expect sales to be about $4.8 billion for the year. Government Systems revenue expectations are unchanged but we now expect Commercial Systems sales growth for the year to be in the high single-digits after incorporating the impacts of the Hawker Beechcraft bankruptcy and the more moderated business jet aftermarket outlook. Even though we've incorporated substantial market-driven revenue headwind this year, we are still expecting to finish within our original EPS guidance range, currently at $4.40, to $4.50. I feel that is a testament to our continued focus on operational performance and execution.","We also adjusted our tax rate expectations to about 29% for the full year and our cash flow guidance to about $600 million, reflecting a reduction of about $30 million in collections from Hawker Beechcraft and higher tax payments related to changes in future expected pension contributions.","Just this last quarter, Congress passed the Transportation Bill, which included provisions providing companies some relief on required pension contributions. Prior to that legislation, we have been expecting mandatory contributions of about $220 million next year compared to our $110 million contribution this year.","Now while we have not fully determined what level of pension funding we'll make next year, the new regulation provides us with much more flexibility relative to capital deployment.","That completes the final review of the financial results and projections, so Steve, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Steve Buesing","Thanks, Patrick. In order to get everyone an opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit to 1 question per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we'll answer those additional questions as time permits.","Bonnie, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Stallard of RBC.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, I don't mean to kick off on the aftermarket and the $1 million decline year-on-year. I was wondering if you can you give any more color on perhaps what sort of aircraft have been most impacted by this decline, if there's any regional variances here or if you see any share loss to contribute to this?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, certainly, we don't see any share loss contributing to it at all, Rob. What I would say is you could take the aftermarket and split it into the 2 pieces, the air transport business and regional, and there are slightly different dynamics between the 2. In the air transport side, I believe that the basic MRO, it actually grew this quarter in low single-digits, about with the pace of traffic growth, which is what you would expect. So that was relatively predictable. And then if you look at the retrofit side, which is making up a greater portion now of it, of recent -- in this year at least because of the large group of 787 spares that we've experienced in the first half of the years, the size of that abated this quarter and then there was a significant lumpiness in the sale of spares to legacy aircraft. I attribute that to primary, just timing. We have always said, since we've been talking about the retrofit side of the aftermarket, that it comes and goes, it's lumpy, it happens when the airlines have cash and decided to do it. We do not at this time think that, that is a result of any tightening of discretionary spending specifically, but it's a timing issue. And in fact, if you look in the next quarter, we're projecting that to return to a high single-digit type growth rate for air transport. So I don't view anything in the aftermarket relative to air transport is a systemic change or a big difference, it was a timing issue more than anything else. In the business jet though, I think you have different dynamics. In this case, we did see a reduction, a very slight reduction in the MRO market, and I do think that is a result of the slowdown in business jet utilization. We talked here recently over the last couple of months that what we were seeing against our projections at the beginning of the year of a 2% to 3% growth in utilization is that year-to-date, it's been flat and we've seen nothing to indicate that, that's going to increase for the balance of the year. And I would say that was the primary determinant of us dropping the revenue forecast by $25 million in the business jet aftermarket part. Contributing to that, I believe, is a lowering in discretionary retrofits, and I believe that's directly proportional to a lot of belt tightening that's going on around the world, especially in Europe relative to upgrades and improvements to business jets. And so that dynamic, I think, in business jets is more focused on the economy and what we might see as a slowing. If that helps.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just a clarification on the business jet, are you seeing any differences between smaller or midsized-cabin jets and the large jets?","Clayton M. Jones","Not in the aftermarket. We're actually seeing -- and actually, we contract the long-range pretty well through our Air Routing acquisition that tracks light travels. And what we're seeing is just less use of those aircraft on international trips.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Clay, I think your margin guidance at the top of the range in this environment is impressive, and can you talk about things that you are doing in terms on the cost side? What are your additional opportunities on the cost side? How far along are you?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, we've taken a lot of actions, actually took another restructuring charge this quarter reflecting a reduction of headcount, and that headcount has come principally out of our Government Systems business but we're also adjusting our shared service spending to continue to manage margins. Another impact is our incentive compensation program, which is designed to reduce the payout as our performance comes down with the market. And so we've seen some benefit from the incentive compensation part as well. I would say this, Heidi, I think we're going to continue to manage our cost structure the way we have in the past and I would say we're right in the middle of that process right now.","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. What I would also add to that is this is kind of unfortunately not our first rodeo. I was counting the other day, this is the 6th cyclical change we've seen in the roughly 11 years we've been a public company. And so I think our guys are getting very good at anticipating these changes and acting very quickly to do that. As Patrick -- I'd reinforce what Patrick said, if revenues were going up, then we'd be talking about a drag of incentive compensation as we add it to that, as we shared that with our employees, but when it goes down, we realized that, that's another lever that we built into our system that allows us to continue to deliver this kind of profitability performance.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But oftentimes, Clay and Patrick, the managements can be tempted to shave their R&D in these periods of time. Can you talk about how we should think about expectations for R&D going forward?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we did suggest in the guidance here that R&D expectation for the year is going down. But I would say that's a combination of 2 things. One is that the government, the customer-funded R&D has been reduced to a certain extent over the year, and the second thing is that we've taken some of the R&D that, frankly, we don't need anymore. I think most specifically, out of something like public safety, which we started the year thinking that was going to be a totally discretionary investment and we've now eliminated that as part of this restructuring I've been talking about in Government Systems. We're continuing to look at what we really need to look like and what is core to our business going forward. And some of the decisions we've made not to invest in ground vehicle systems, not to invest in soldier systems, not to invest in public safety, has allowed us to reduce some of the R&D, but it's in the areas that we don't think are core to the business. In the meantime, we're spending very robustly in the commercial side of our business, for the instantiations of all the Pro Line Fusion, cockpits are going to be going in, the CSeries that I mentioned is still an investment, the A350 we're still investing in as we bring that closer to certification. And so none of that has been reduced as we look at what's core to the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on share repurchase. You guys continue to buy back a lot of stock. You did issue -- or the Board did issue a lower authorization than the last one during the quarter, I noticed though and your balance sheet is up to 43% debt to cap. So my question is what, if anything, can we read into those in terms of our restraints on future activity?","Patrick E. Allen","I wouldn't read anything into the size of the reauthorization. What I would say is though we are going to continue to be active in the share repurchase program, both this -- for the remainder of this year and going into next year, I would also comment that the guidance does not assume a significant benefit from fourth quarter share repurchases. So I think you'll see that the activity be somewhat less in the fourth quarter than you've seen over the course of the balance of the year. But Joe, we still remain committed to returning value to share owners through dividends and share repurchases.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Patrick, what's your -- in terms of the rating, what is your understanding of how high you can go on the debt to total capital metric to maintain your rating and how important is maintaining that rating?","Patrick E. Allen","We haven't had any discrete discussions with respect to the rating agencies -- with the rating agencies with respect to that metric, so I'd hate to speculate on that. As a matter of fact, they don't like to do that with us. So I do believe we have some room in the current rating to increase debt to total capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just have a quick question here on the dispatch services contract you've signed with China. I think you have 6 airlines signed up so far. I just wanted to know if you could provide any color on how you see 787 services trending, what your expectations are for just service solutions in general there?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we have long said that our -- at least, planning guideline is that roughly half of the 787 customers will choose to dispatch power by the hour approach to service and the other half will buy the spares outright. With a relatively limited sample size today, that's about how it's playing out. Now we have had a recent number of selections that we announced at Farnborough, that have chosen the dispatch approach, which if I had to shave it one way or the other, for the long-term health of the business, that would be our preference. We just feel that, that being a new product in the avionics field, it would be unwise to suggest more than half would be doing it and I think we'll wait and see it play out to see if we're off on those percentages. But that's what our expectation is. I think, for the decisions in China, where there is perhaps more acceptance of that, it's why we've been particularly successful in that dispatch 100 product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick clarification and then a question on R&D. Pat, can you size the benefit from incentive comp in the second half due to the lower accruals?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I would say this, it's probably in the range of about $45 million. [indiscernible] 2 quarters.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the R&D, you're going to exit in the fourth quarter with obviously a much lower run rate in R&D than what you were thinking before. It looked like you were expecting quite a bit ramp up in the fourth quarter. How should we think about what that means for how R&D trends in 2013? It looks like the run rate is going to look more flattish sequentially. Is that something that will remain in 2013, in fiscal '13, or is it going to re-ramp just later?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, the unfortunate way that we disclose the R&D amount, I think, is not very transparent to the actual amount of R&D we're spending. And we've tried to, over the course of a host of conversations, talk about the deferred engineering rate that we have on our balance sheet that, that is an inventory item that confuses a lot of people, but that's the way you account for it. That is going to total about $130 million this year. So even with this reduction, we'll spend about $1 billion a year and we'll be up year-over-year in R&D. I would expect as we go into next year, that we'll probably be up again. I can't remember a year in my history here at Rockwell Collins we're we've not increased R&D year-over-year. So even though the run rate is changing a little bit for reasons I just described to Heidi's question, I would expect that our move into new product lines, our success in the market, and I would say in both sides, both government and commercial, should allow us to continue to increase that R&D expenditures as we are winning new programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Clay, at Government Systems, I know you're facing some headwinds, some specific program headwinds next year, could you walk us through those and maybe give some color if whether Government Systems is down? Assuming the sequester doesn't happen, if Government Systems is down in the same range next year or could it potentially be down even more than what we're seeing in '12?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I think the specific things we've said before, David, is we have a continuation of the DAGR reductions that have plagued us this year, I think will continue into next year, primarily as a function of the up-tempo, in this case, in Afghanistan, as well as Iraq, coming down and they have plenty of inventory of that. So we had forecast a fairly dramatic couple of year reduction in DAGR and that will continue into '13. That would be one large one. The largest one of the bunch is the E6 program that we have. It'll be transitioning next year from development into production and as is typically the case, we saw that in KC-135, we mentioned it in JPALS this quarter, you're going to see a reduction in spending as they test the airplane and get the approvals to move into production. And that will probably be the largest one and I think that's -- we've actually quantified that to about $50 million of headwind there. And I think programmatically, those are probably the 2 largest one that we have. To the second part of your question, that's such a hard question to answer there, David. When we think -- when we're thinking through our budgetary process this year, we're probably going to do it in scenarios with and without sequestration. I would say that Kelly Ortberg and his team are still working on that, and for me to give you a order of magnitude would probably be premature today, but coming to a theater near you.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on FireStorm, I know you're expecting some upside there, is the contract signed or when should we expect that?","Clayton M. Jones","The contract is not signed. We would hope we would be able to be in a position to announce it this quarter but that is largely dependent on the pace of the procurement chain in the Middle East. If we've learned anything over time, one must exercise patience. But we do know this, the contract is moving through the process. We have people in-country that have validated that and now it's just a matter of getting it on the right desk with the right signature and we're hopeful that will happen this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Patrick, you said that you're down $45 million in incentive comp, so my recollection is that was set at $90 million, so are we to believe that it's now $45 million? And could you give us a little color how that...","Patrick E. Allen","Yes. As I reflect on that, Cai, I may have overstated that a little bit. It's probably closer to $35 million to $40 million, and what I'd say is that the incentive compensation right now is set around 60%.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then so, how should we think, I mean, just notionally, you always reset it to 100%, which is $100 million, so that's going to be a headwind next year, and your tax rate is lower in this quarter, where is it going to be for the year and isn't that going to be a headwind for next year also?","Patrick E. Allen","Certainly, if the Congress does not pass the R&D tax credit, it will be a headwind for next year. The tax rate, I would suggest, will probably be somewhere in the 31%, 32% range for next year. And obviously, incentive compensation will be a headwind as well, because you're right, we do reset it to $100 million.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And where is the tax rate this year?","Patrick E. Allen","We are forecasting it to be about 29% for the full year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Amit Mehrotra here for Myles Walton. Clay, can you comment on the cadence of activity in the discretionary aftermarket during the quarter, specifically on the large transport side? Was activity fairly constant throughout the quarter or was there any dropoff as the quarter progressed from the tail end?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, as I mentioned before, the big dropoff was in the amount of spare sales that we delivered this quarter in the big air transport side. A couple of things going on there, a deceleration in 787 spares. So sequentially, we were down although we still deliver a few 787 spares. In terms of year-over-year, that wasn't a big contributor, but the biggest one was in some of the legacy programs. And again, I attribute that more to timing than I believe there's any systemic change in buying behavior because we expect the discretionary side to be up in the fourth quarter and we have reasonably good visibility at this close range of what we're talking to airlines about right now. So I think that's just a lumpy quarter perturbation, again, that we've always said exists in that market.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Clay, even with the revised free cash flow guidance, the company looks to be in a pretty nice cash position, I think, in the next 6 to 9 months. So would that -- how do you think about using cash to buy back shares versus maybe making acquisitions to more quickly increase the commercial mix in the business?","Patrick E. Allen","We've always talked about our cash deployment philosophy, and really, it hasn't changed here. Our first priority is acquisitions, but it's a pretty sparse environment right now. We haven't seen a lot of acquisition activity over the course of the last year or so. So in the event that we don't see acquisitions, we'll continue to return value to share owners through share repurchases and dividends.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Clay, just going back to your comments in the monologue on '13. With Defense down in fiscal '13, budget investment accounts are down, you talked about some of the pressures there. And commercial not up meaningfully until '14, and then Patrick just acknowledged you might have a higher tax rate, is it fair to assume that any earnings growth in '13 has to be fully derived from the buyback?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I don't want to really respond to that until we finish putting our budgets together, Rob. What I've tried to do is give you some of the macro dynamics that we're facing as we put our budgets together. Obviously, there's a host of things that we're still trying to settle in on the budget that could affect what that earnings power is going to be next year. And so without question, we've used the share buyback this year as an accelerant while we're going through a period of relatively flat growth. And so if we go into next year with those same set of circumstances, then obviously, that -- you can reasonably intuit that, that would be a source of growth next year as well. But whether that's the only or major or how a proportion that is, I think it would be premature for me to comment on that at this time.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you think you'll be able to guide mid -- is mid-September as you usually do?","Clayton M. Jones","We're still thinking pretty deeply about that. I would say, right now, we haven't absolutely made our mind up but I would say that we're now tending to guide probably with scenario ranges around what happens with or without sequestration to give people a sense of that very anomalous overhang to our business. But again, I'm going to wait to see what confidence we have when -- especially our Government Systems people put their budgets together and if I can, with some degree of confidence, give you that range of results or give you that look at what we expect to have under those conditions then I would -- it would be my preference to give guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the aftermarket, the outlook there at one point was for low double-digit growth for the year. You're trending below that and the rate of growth appears to be slowing, I just wondered if you could update us on where you expect the full year to come in. And then for next year, if you could, without giving a number but just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes, it seems like, again, the core business rate of growth is just getting tougher in terms of comparisons. And then on the 787 initial sparing, I'm assuming that's a pretty big -- a pretty tough comparison next year?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, first, I would say that we're probably talking about high single-digit aftermarket growth now all-in, specifically impacted by this business jet aftermarket reduction that we're taking now, so that's the answer to your first question. For the second question, what I would say is, yes, I think I painted a picture that we are still going to continue on a tough market environment next year. The venture's going to be down. We think air transport's going to be up but with, again, increasingly difficult comparables. And then business jets is going to be the swinger as to what happens in that area, depending on the economy. So that's the landscape we do see right now. Relative to the 787 spares, I think it will be a more difficult comparable but again, they're delivering to more airlines next year, so I'd still think that, that will be a nice upper to our business next year, it just won't be the same rate of upper that we saw specifically in the first half when we're reporting mid- to high-teens aftermarket growth in the air transport side. So I don't think you'll see those levels but I still think you'll see that being a nice tailwind.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Okay. And then just one other one. Maybe this is for Patrick. I'm just wondering if you could sort of speak to the sustainability of these government margins. They've been fairly resilient in the face of, clearly, a tough top line environment then what appears to be tougher terms of trade coming out of the Pentagon. If the government top line continues to decline, what should we be looking for in terms of the sustainability of these government margins going forward?","Patrick E. Allen","That's a tough question to answer, Noah, because it depends upon the rate of decline and where we see that decline. I think, over the course of the last couple of years, we've managed the decline very well through restructuring action, through aggressive cost reductions in the government side of the business, obviously benefiting a little bit from mix because most of the revenues that came out have been relatively lower-margin development-type programs. However, I think, over time, we're going to continue to see some pressure from the volume being a negative headwind. But if we continue to see a higher hardware mix and greater international sales, that should be a tailwind. So I'm thinking over the course of the next few years, if we see a moderation of the reduction in government revenues, we should be able to maintain that 20% to 22% margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Just a follow-up on the government margin. If you look sequentially and take out the benefit last quarter, it went from 19.4% to the 21.8% we saw this quarter. Patrick, if you could kind of walk through what the benefits were to that? I mean, was the lower R&D for the year that you provided a part of that? Any warranty benefit, and if there's step down, any incentive comps that you were talking about for the corporation overall?","Patrick E. Allen","I think, probably from a sequential perspective, George, I'd highlight 2 things. One is we are continuing to manage our discretionary spending, so that's coming down. The benefit from our incentive compensation adjustment would be a sequential benefit as well, and sequentially, our volume is up and that also provides margin tailwind. So those will be the 3 major contributors.","George Shapiro","Could you just quantify the ballpark, say, the decline in R&D and the incentive comp benefit or just ratio it according to the -- or do I just ratio it according to the sales of the sectors?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I would say that the company-funded R&D is just a couple of million dollars. The incentive compensation is probably in the range of about $10 million sequentially.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi Investment Research.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Clay, in the past, you've spoken about what you viewed to be the long-term growth rate of the business jet market. I'm just wondering if you could update us with your current thoughts given the last couple of years and the way things have played out?","Clayton M. Jones","I'm still bullish on double-digit growth in the long-term. I think, what we're experiencing now is a very unusually slow recovery as compared against any previous cyclical recovery where we have had now, what would be almost 3 years of negative or no growth in that market. And there is inevitably pent-up demand that occurs during that period of time that will be satiated at some point. I think the causals for the relatively slow recovery are all around us, and it's called the global economy. And it's the same reason capital spending and a variety of industries is much lower than any of us would have expected at this time and why this industry is being impacted. I still believe that the fundamental drivers of business aviation are in place. I think the long-term growth prospects of business aviation, especially in developing markets, is going to be very good. It's just that we're working our way through a period where people aren't spending much money on capital improvements, much less transportation capital improvements. And so I don't know what to say as to what the shape of the global economy is going to be over the next 2 to 3 years. You guys could call that as well as I can. But I can tell you once we get some economic improvement, I think you'll see a direct and proportional improvement in business aviation. And my hope, and that's what it is at this point in time is that, that hits at, or before the time when we get this big inflow of market share gains that should start kicking in, in 2014, as we begin to deliver those litany of new airplanes, which are always better sellers than the existing fleet that will be coming out over the next 4, 5 years. So I mean, I think, it's going to be a great growth story for this company and others in that business. But we've got to work our way through the economy before we get there.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the fiscal '13 comments, you've spoken in the past about trying to generate double-digit earnings per share growth. Given all of the moving pieces, is that still a legitimate goal for investors to expect at this point given what you know today about fiscal '13?","Clayton M. Jones","I believe that -- well, judge us by this year, Jason. We're going to be basically flat in sales and up double-digits in EPS. And I have not given up on that goal. And I would say this, the revenue that we're able to generate is somewhat in my control but largely out of it. I can't control bankruptcies. I can't control European recoveries. I can't control defense spending or sequestration, and I've just got to take what I get there. But the thing I can control is my spending and my rates of profitability and my efficiency in the company and my returns on invested capital. And ultimately, I have some ability to lever and control my earnings per share. And we're going to be focused like a laser beam on doing that. So yes, I do believe, to answer your question, that is a reasonable goal and we will be working very diligently over the course of the next couple of months preceding guidance to try to deliver on that goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Perlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just looking at your guidance and the revisions, you've now got revenues and margins, I guess, down to a single point, and yet, there's still $0.10 kind of swing for just this fourth quarter, so can you just kind of talk about what might move you from either $4.40 or $4.50 in that range or are you much more comfortable, I guess, at one part of that?","Patrick E. Allen","I would say this, I mean, we've selected a single point estimate for margins and for sales but there is variability around that. So I would tell you that those are the 2 things that are most likely to swing our earnings per share to the lower end or the top end of that range would be where we fall relative to those single data points.","Clayton M. Jones","If we tightened it, it'd make your job too easy.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Of course. And then just separately, Patrick, can you just -- where did you end the quarter in terms of the preproduction engineering within the inventory?","Patrick E. Allen","Hold on just one second, I'm not -- Steve's looking that up. We were forecasting about a $130 million growth year-over-year and I would say, we're still on track for that growth. What the total balance is, is coming here shortly. We ended up in about $534 million of preproduction engineering for the quarter.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just -- I mean, does that growth stay at that same pace into next year or does it moderate for next year?","Patrick E. Allen","When we provide guidance, we'll let you know but I would suspect there's still going to be a fair amount of spending on preproduction engineering next year as we continue on programs like the A350 and the CSeries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick question for you, Clay. You mentioned the possibility of sequestration in your prepared remarks, how do you prepare the company to deal with that uncertainty, given all the uncertainty around does it happen, doesn't happen. I mean, as a leader, how do you think about that?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we talk about it a lot. The way we're going to deal with it, Ron, is we're going to prepare scenarios as best as we can, as to what the impact would be if there was sequestration, knowing we're almost certainly going to be wrong. But there is some reasonable expectation we can put around and across the board, instantaneous reduction in spending and how that might flow to us, so we're going to take the best swag we can at it. The other difficulty is there's only so much you can do to prepare, in fact, a lot of that you don't want to do to prepare because, again, I think we're all discounting the fact that it's going to happen but there is some possibility that it will. So given that, you don't want to do anything stupid beforehand, anticipating it's going to happen and then it doesn't, and then you put yourself in a spot given the probability. But that said, I think it will mostly be reactive and preparing ourselves to react as quickly as possible should that become the law of the land or state law of the land I should say, and then we'll react as quickly as we can accordingly. The unfortunate part is the biggest disruption is going to be on people and what the potential impact could be to employment. And all I can do is be honest with our people that, that's a possibility that we hope won't come to fruition but if it does, we're going to have to move quickly, and get the people who have to take those actions ready to do so and then support and work with the people that might be impacted as best we can. It's a horrible thing to consider but we may have to do it so we'll man up and do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things. One first on Hawker, how do you manage what you have to deal with there, Clay? It looks like you probably took reserves for about half of your exposure? And then I have a follow-up.","Patrick E. Allen","As it relates to reserves, we took about -- roughly about a $5 million reserve against Hawker. And last quarter, we disclosed a rate of about a $30 million receivables, so the exposure is far greater than twice $5 million.","Clayton M. Jones","And with that said, Howard, we are full well expecting that whatever they do, whether they sell the company or come out of bankruptcy and continue to operate, that the balance of that receivable will be in assumed contracts because they certainly will not be able to produce airplanes unless they continue to accept our equipment. And so as they work their way through either the sell or the bankruptcy process, we think that the ultimate conclusion will be that they'll assume those contracts. Now we're also saying that as they work their way through that process, it's unlikely they'll make that determination before the end of our fiscal year, and that's why we've lowered a good portion of our cash flow guidance because those receivables are going to be very difficult to get in this fiscal year. So I think there's some of those things we have to work out but we have a reasonably good expectation that they'll assume the contract, except for those we wrote off.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, I understand. I mean, the reality is if they don't, then there's a different negotiation that goes forward.","Clayton M. Jones","Yes, right.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then the second thing is could you talk a little bit about where you are in the military radio market? I mean, especially in the army world, it's kind of been tilted upside down and you're still in the hunt for a number of things?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes. I mean, first thing, we're really pleased with the growth we experienced this quarter as we got the pig through the pipeline there and a lot of the programs that were dragging us down went through, and it's where our traditional strengths are, data links, some of the networking comm business. We're very hopeful that the Defense Acquisition Board, which is expected to meet later this week will approve the Low Rate Initial Production of the JTRS HMS program. And if it does, then that will provide at least one of the surviving, in fact, I would say, that and this [ph] the only 2 surviving JTRS components will be moving forward. And so that is specifically addressed at the army market and the applications that will have, which we believe could be a nice growth engine for us if that DAB LRIP is approved and we move forward there. So that's probably in military communications, one of the big growth drivers we have, in addition to the data links and some of the international software-defined radios that we're already working on.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that's one of -- I mean, it sort of sounds like that's a bright spot, Clay, and maybe it's a little bit better than you might have thought? I mean, it does offset some of the other issues, is that fair?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, yes. In the Government business, we're looking for any bright spots we can. And if you look at our business in total and you look at the 4 portfolios, without question, Avionics and Communication represent the majority of the core and what we believe are going to be nice, stable, required elements of someone's defense structure, both home and abroad in the future. And those will be the strengths of our company that we build around that I believe in the long term, will serve us and the share owners very well, yes.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Keybanc Capital Market.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Clay, maybe just a point of clarification. On the aftermarket, on commercial transport side, did you say you're expecting that to trend up into the high single-digits in the fourth quarter? And if so, I mean, typically, I think of maybe the summer flying season as a lot of utilization, maybe some slow aftermarket, what's giving you the confidence and visibility there?","Clayton M. Jones","I did say that we expect the Air Transport segment or the aftermarket to trend up in the fourth quarter. And I think that's a function of the line of sight we see into a lot of the discretionary aftermarket. The thing that really hit us hard this quarter, I'll reiterate, is that discretionary piece that is remarkably lumpy and if I said it once, I said it a thousand times, don't judge us on one quarter, making a trend in that retrofit market, because it comes and goes as programs start and stop, as airlines decide to buy or not buy, and it's just not a linear activity. We have regionally good visibility because we actually talk to these customers about what they're going to buy or not buy, and that's what gives us some confidence we're going to see a relatively more normalized growth in the air transport aftermarket. Now I did say, just for perfect clarity, that we're probably going to see continued weakness in the biz jet aftermarket, as a result of those systemic global economic trends there. So that's likely not to be quite as robust, that's probably going to be maybe low single-digits. But you combine the 2 and we should return to a reasonably good aftermarket growth in the fourth quarter.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Buesing for any closing remarks.","Steve Buesing","We plan to file our Form 10-Q later today, so please see that document for additional notes and disclosures.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Steve Buesing. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Darla, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clay Jones; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.","Please note that today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and, from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.","Clayton M. Jones","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. With the first and, I'd say, the most difficult half of our fiscal year complete, I'm pleased that the second quarter results came in just as we had expected. Even though second quarter revenue declined 5% from last year as headwinds faced in Government Systems were only partially offset by growth in Commercial Systems, net income rose 7%, resulting from a 90-basis-point increase in operating margins and a lower tax rate. The increased net income, when combined with the share repurchases year-to-date that reduced our outstanding shares by 5%, resulted in earnings per share of $1.09, which is a 14% increase from last year.","Now looking a little deeper into the results of our 2 businesses, we saw performance continue to improve in Commercial Systems, with revenue growth across both market segments. In the air transport market, the robust backlog at Boeing and Airbus is enabling both OEMs to increase production rates. In addition, Boeing continues to ramp up production for the 787 according to their latest schedule, and we've increased our 787 rates to 4 ship sets per month.","In the air transport aftermarket, revenue growth is predominantly being driven by spares provisioning as the airlines that take initial deliveries of 787 and 747-8. So far, the 7 airlines -- sorry, so far 7 airlines have made their 787 sparing decisions regarding their products, with 3 choosing to purchase spares directly, and the other 4 choosing a power-by-the-hour alternative for spares asset management. We expected a relatively even split between the 2 option, and that seems to be exactly how it's playing out.","In the business jet market, increased deliveries of Pro Line Fusion to Bombardier continue to drive our OEM revenue growth. I'm also pleased to report that we hit a significant entry-into-service milestone this quarter when Bombardier delivered their first Global 5000 and Global 6000 aircraft featuring our Avionics. Beyond the first 2 Globals, we are working development programs to put Pro Line Fusion on 9 announced aircraft platforms which enter into service over the next 5 years.","Regarding the Embedded Display System variant of Pro Line Fusion, development is progressing according to our schedule, and we have successfully secured our first OEM position at the light end of the market.","So for the first half of the year, we've seen about a 10% revenue growth in Commercial Systems, and that business has generated 230 basis points of margin expansion.","Our Government Systems results came in as expected, with a 12% decline in revenue and operating margins holding steady at around 20%. Despite the adverse market conditions, we've experienced consistent growth in Avionics as the Saudi F-15 and the 3 tanker programs, the KC-46, KC-10 and KC-390, are ramping up. These programs are all progressing on plan, and I expect them to be long-term revenue drivers for this business.","Just this quarter, we were awarded additional content on the KC-390, further demonstrating our strengthening relationship with Embraer and the Brazilian Ministry of Defense. Meanwhile, our other 3 product categories in Government Systems saw headwinds from previously canceled programs and reduced DAGR deliveries, which pulled down sales this quarter as expected. Most of these revenue headwinds are behind us for the year, and we continue to expect revenue growth in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate.","Our focus this year in Government Systems has been to sustain margin performance and generate strong cash flows. And so far, that's exactly what that team has done in the face of some pretty big challenges. However, just as things appear to be getting a little more predictable, a series of events has caused us to reduce our revenue guidance for the year. One was a strategic decision we made and spoke about earlier this quarter, while the other 2 were market-driven events.","First, we've decided to discontinue any further investment in our public safety vehicle systems. We became convinced that the lack of an effective national distribution system, combined with supply chain reliability issues, would marginalize our ability to grow this business profitably. Although we've curtailed any further investment, we do plan to support our current customers. This decision took approximately $20 million of expected revenue out of the second half of the year.","The second impact relates to our FireStorm targeting systems we had planned to sell into the Middle East. This is actually a \"good news, bad news\" story. The bad news is that we now expect those deliveries to move out of the year. The good news is that the customer delayed the execution of the contract because they now intend to combine it with another purchase of additional targeting systems, increasing the total content of the program.","The delay associated with the execution of this contract, however, will slide approximately $40 million of revenue out of the back half of fiscal year 2012 and into next year. Both the public safety and FireStorm adjustments are within the Surface Solutions portfolio of Government Systems. Based on these changes, we're now expecting Surface Solutions to be down about 30% when compared to last year.","The third change is in Commercial Systems and resulted from a recent development at the light end of the business jet market. Last quarter, I told you that I was expecting a double-digit increase in business jet production across all sectors and growth at all of the OEMs. After discussions this quarter with one of the OEMs, I still expect production to increase, but now in high single digits, reflecting a year-over-year reduction at that OEM where we had discussions. This change reduced our revenue forecast by about $30 million in the second half of the year compared to our original plans.","So what does the impact of these adjustments to our plan mean for the remainder of the fiscal year? We still expect growth in the second half of 2012 across both business segments. And we're taking appropriate actions to control costs and hold to our previous EPS commitments. Government Systems' growth is now expected to be in the low single digits for the remainder of the year, driven by the tanker programs, sales of R210 radios, JTRS HMS, initial deliveries and increased revenue from the Saudi F-15 program.","In Commercial Systems, we expect about a 10% growth for the balance of the year, driven by higher air transport OEM production rates, including the 787, increased sales of new business jets and continued aftermarket growth. Increased revenues should generate continued margin expansion across the next 2 quarters in both businesses and enable the double-digit earnings per share growth we guided to at the beginning of the year.","With that, now I'd like to turn the balance of the call over to Patrick.","Patrick E. Allen","Thanks, Clay, and good morning to everyone as well. Let's get started by first reviewing our results for the total company that are shown on Slides 3 and 4.","Total company sales for the quarter came in at $1.16 billion, a decrease of 5% from last year. Net income and earnings per share increased 7% and 14%, respectively. The greater increase in earnings per share when compared with net income was due to share repurchases.","The increase in net income was primarily driven by our lower effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 of 24.4%, which is about 700 basis points lower than the rate for the second quarter of 2011. This lower rate was primarily due to a favorable adjustment resulting from the settlement of 2 tax years with the IRS, partially offset by differences in the availability of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit. The net favorable impact of those 2 tax items was $15 million or $0.10 per share.","Turning to Slides 5 and 6, we have the second quarter results of our Commercial Systems business, which reported revenues of $533 million, up 7% from $500 million in the second quarter of 2011. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $19 million, or 7%, to $289 million, driven by higher product deliveries for the Bombardier Global platform and increased sales to Boeing and Airbus resulting from higher production rates across their product lines.","Last year, we had a favorable mix of airline selectable equipment for Boeing 737 aircraft, which made it a different -- difficult comparable. This year was a more traditional customer mix, and the higher production rates on 737 aircraft mostly offset the difficult comp.","Aftermarket sales increased $19 million or 9% to $220 million, driven by increased spare sales related to 787 and 747-8 aircraft, as well as increased air transport retrofit sales.","Commercial Systems' operating earnings increased 23% to $112 million or 21% of sales, compared to operating earnings of $91 million or 18.2% of sales in the second quarter last year. The increase in earnings and operating margin was primarily due to the earnings flow on the higher sales volume.","On Slide 7, we see Government Systems' revenue came in, as expected, with a decline of 12% to $628 million. Avionic sales grew 4% to $365 million as increased sales from the Saudi F-15 fighter and the KC-46 and KC-10 tanker programs more than offset lower sales resulting from the completion of deliveries on the KC-135 GATM program.","Sales of communication products declined 19% to $154 million due to the completion of a contract to provide transportable cellular capabilities in Afghanistan and fewer deliveries of satellite communication terminals.","Surface Solutions' sales decreased 37% to $58 million, principally due to 2 programs which were terminated for convenience in the third quarter of last year.","Finally, Navigation Products' sales were down 38% to $51 million, driven by fewer deliveries of our hand-held GPS receivers.","Slide 8 shows Government Systems' second quarter operating earnings, which were $128 million. Operating margins came in at 20.4%, relatively flat to the 20.9% margins reported last year. The impact of lower sales volume to current year operating earnings and margins was partially offset by a $6-million reduction in company-funded research and development spending and $5 million of favorable warranty adjustments.","On Slide 9, we have our 6-month year-to-date total company financial results for sales, EPS, net income and operating cash flow. Through the first half of the year, our sales have decreased by 3% as the headwinds in our Government Systems have been mostly offset with growth in Commercial Systems.","Our year-to-date operating cash flow has decreased $82 million to $45 million in 2012. The primary drivers of the decrease in cash flow include $62 million in increased payments for employee incentive compensation and $50 million of higher income tax payments due to the expiration of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit, which were partially offset by increased customer receipts.","Moving to Slide 10, we show the status of our capital structure. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $774 million in long-term debt outstanding as compared to $528 million at the end of fiscal 2011. We believe our debt-to-total-capital ratio of 40% at the end of the second quarter, in combination with our investment-grade credit ratings, provides us the ability to fund our growth needs cost effectively.","If you turn to Slide 11, we provide details related to the updated status of our share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock at an average cost of $58.26 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity since 2002 to about 72 million shares, or $3.5 billion returned to shareowners through maintaining an active share repurchase program.","In addition to returning capital to the shareowners through share repurchases, we also, just yesterday, announced that the Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.30 per share. This increase, which is consistent with our capital deployment philosophy, will take effect with our third quarter dividend payment.","Now onto our final slide, Slide 12, where we provide the details of our updated fiscal year 2012 financial guidance. As Clay mentioned in his opening remarks, we've made a few updates to our revenue guidance and now expect it to be about $4.85 billion for the year. Government Systems' revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits for the year, with low-single-digit growth in the back half of the year.","Within Government Systems, we now expect Surface Solutions to be down over 30% for the full year, with the sales guidance related to the other 3 product portfolios remaining unchanged.","In Commercial Systems, sales growth for the year should be in around 10%, with OEM revenue growth now expected to be in the low double digits.","However, even though we've lowered revenue guidance, our focus of controlling costs is expected to enable us to still achieve earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $4.60. All of the other components of our guidance remain unchanged.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Steve, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Steve Buesing","Thank you, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Clay, you mentioned one change on the business jet side with one customer. Is that one customer Hawker? And also, could you just talk about your exposure at Hawker relative to what's going on there and the potential downside?","Clayton M. Jones","It is Hawker. And as everyone knows, we've been watching carefully the evolution of events there for over a year as rumors have gone back and forth. I think they have been relatively public in some of the things that they're doing to try to rationalize their debt situation, and we're continuing to keep a close eye on that. Dave, it's really hard to say what the impact is going to be because, first, we don't know what they're going to do; and second, we don't know when they're going to do it. And this is sort of a fluctuating circumstance, as we continue to ship them product because they're still building airplanes. I would -- the only, I guess, color we could give you is if you had to saw it off today, we have an outstanding receivables balance of about $30 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, follow-up question. On the guidance, the $4.60, the top end of the range, you obviously brought down your sales guidance. Everything else remained the same. Could you just talk about how you can get the $4.60, because it's difficult to see the path, even taking the guidance that you've laid out for the segments?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, the quick hit is Congress reauthorized the R&D tax credit. That'd be one way. And as is always the case, when you have 6 months left to go, we have opportunities as well as risks. We're trying to balance those, and it's for that reason that we lowered our revenue guidance. But both businesses have done a great job of controlling costs. And I would say that there's enough vagary in the sales forecasting for the balance of the year where there -- if there was no chance to get there, we would have not -- we would have narrowed the range. But I think at this time, we can't say that.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So can you get there without the R&D tax credit extension or no?","Clayton M. Jones","I think we can get higher than the mid-range without that, yes. And like I said, it's not without the realm of possibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Clay, can you talk a little bit more about Surface Solutions? Just in terms of I think back in February, you thought it would be a near-20% decline in the quarter. Now it was certainly over 30%. And just talk a little bit about, I guess, what changed, what's moving. And then outside of disinvesting in the public safety, are there other things you can do to restructure and resize that business?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I think you can walk through that, Sam, real logical and it's very simple. When we were talking about the acceleration of our -- I mean, we changed sort of the implication in February, as you suggested. We are on the record talking about some erosion there. It was specifically because we are also talking at the same time about our curtailing the investment in public safety. So of the 3 impacts I talked about today, that one had been obviously well forecast before today because it was within our power, and so we knew that one was coming up. The balance of it is this FireStorm order, and so that tipped it basically from 20% to 30% down because it's in that portfolio, as I said in my opening remarks. So the erosion that we've seen from original guidance in Surface Solutions is almost exclusively related to those 2 items. Remember, this is a small portfolio, so numbers do begin to mount up when you're talking about percentage changes. Relative to the rest of the portfolio, we're still analyzing that, as you would expect us to. We have made this one decision for vehicle safety systems. There could be other things that we could consolidate or make some strategic determination. But until we make that, it would be inappropriate for me to talk about it.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Pat, can you just size the favorable warranty adjustment in -- within Government Systems and just your expectations for that warranty as we go through the rest of the year?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, let me -- maybe if I could raise it up a little bit and talk about our reserve positions in total. If you look at our 2 largest reserves, we've got warranty reserves and customer incentives. Those 2 basically net out for the quarter. In fact, on a net basis, we've increased reserves by $3 million on lower sales. But we are seeing the dynamic that warranty reserves are coming down in Government Systems and they're coming down for a couple of reasons. One's pretty logical, and that is sales are coming down. Programs are finishing up. So there were general warranty adjustments in the range of $8 million or so. And then there was a specific warranty adjustment of $6 million related to a program, and that is the JDAM, the Joint Direct Attack Munitions. And the source of that adjustment was really we designed out 2 products, and as a result of -- or 2 components of that product. And as a result of that redesign, it improved both the reliability and the cost of repair for JDAMs. And so as a result, we were able to take a $6-million adjustment to that reserve. So -- but again, I'm not at all surprised that we're seeing warranty reserves come down on the government side and customer incentives come up on the commercial side because, of course, commercial sales are increasing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Clay, you're 9% on aftermarket. You talked about a predominant driver there being provisioning. But can you parse out provisioning versus spares and retrofit, and give us a sense of the relative sizes of the growth there or lack thereof? And how biz jet aftermarket did?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, one, I can tell you between air transport and biz jet aftermarket, the air transport really drove it this year -- I mean, this quarter, excuse me, largely because of that provisioning. Biz jet aftermarket was a little lighter. I'd say kind of mid-single digits this quarter. But that's just because of the lumpy nature of it with some of the retrofits we scheduled out through the year. We expect -- as a matter of fact, our forecast would call for the biz jet aftermarket to strengthen through the rest of the year. So as we've always said, when you're dealing with aftermarket in both of these segments, it does get a little lumpy depending on what's going on in there. But I think if you were to take the provisioning out, it would probably be, I want to say, still high single digits.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the biz jet side, is it more discretionary or mandatory utilization-based activity you're looking for there?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, biz jet's always typically more driven by the discretionary retrofits we put in there, because they don't get as many flight hours as the air transport fleet does, whereas the air transport fleet typically is predominated by the MRO or the nondiscretionary. I would say that because of the higher mix of these initial spare sales, that we're overall, in aftermarket, about 50-50 now of the discretionary and nondiscretionary. So what that would imply, as you would expect, is there's some growth in the nondiscretionary side because we put spares sort of in that category.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one on product opportunity. Wanted to see if there's any new development on C-130 for the Air Force as they look to go with a more off-the-shelf solution. And then perhaps, if you've seen any opening of a window on the MAX, which is getting further specification detail. And then just for Patrick, what happens when this authorization is up?","Clayton M. Jones","See, that'd be 3 questions. Let me see if I can go through the first 2, Rob. What I can tell you is the Air Force is moving out very aggressively to replace the canceled C-130 AMP program. We see a lot of activity there, and we believe over -- that, that procurement will take place over the course of our fiscal year '13, probably for most likely maybe an early '14 award. And so in government terms, that's pretty fast. But yes, I think they're aggressively moving to do that. So we think that's a very distinct opportunity given the positions we have on other C-130s. On the MAX, those discussions are continuing. I think, as I said in the past, we do not expect Boeing to make a decision on any of the subsystems probably until the end of this calendar year. So it's going to take a little while before we know. But I would say, they're still talking about what's in the realm of the possible, and we're still giving them certain ideas that they might factor in that. And my guess, it'll be a cost risk analysis as to what else they want to do to the airplane.","Patrick E. Allen","And, Rob, as it relates to the authorization, I assume you're meaning share repurchase authorization. And bottom line is we'll spend until we're out of authorization, then we'll go back to the board and talk to them and likely get another authorization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Clay, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes on the Pro Line Fusion EDS and talk about the pipeline that's going on there, and how many more slots you think you've got an opportunity to bid for over the next year or so.","Clayton M. Jones","Well, remember, Jason, we're -- we just announced that we have this offering. I think it's noteworthy that we already have a competitive win that's unannounced, and as you might expect, there's a lot of customer interest. And so I'd say, we're in the selling phase now and the orientation phase of making sure all of our customers know what the full spectrum of Pro Line Fusion is now. Recall that even though we talk about EDS as a form factor for the light and small, it's all based on the same software platform. It all has the same features available to it. It makes -- in fact, I would contend, we're the only avionics company that can offer that to OEMs to go through the full spectrum of their fleets with the same features, look and feel. We've offered some very exciting new technologies of touch screens and autonomous control and compact HUD that I think are first in the marketplace. And so you would expect that to generate a lot of interest, and it has. And in fact, I'd say the interest even transcends the business jet market. As we have done in the past, we believe there's opportunities to move EDS into military systems, especially those that are looking for lower-cost, lightweight upgrades to systems. And we've even seen air transport OEMs curious about some of the features we've introduced. So it's a very exciting time now, and it's hard to predict exactly how that's going to roll out in orders, but we're very bullish that the Fusion platform is going to be wildly successful. In fact, I would argue it already is, given that we're working on 9 platforms that'll deliver in the next 5 years, and those are just the ones that have been announced, and there's some unannounced behind them.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up question, kind of a clarification on a previous question. Your exposure to Hawker you described is $30 million on the balance sheet. Can you give us some sense of what the revenue exposure is on a quarterly basis over the last year or so?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we don't break that out for any of our OEMs, Jason, and so I'm not going to do it for Hawker. But suffice to say, obviously, the $30-million reduction that we took in commercial is attendant to, I'll call it the times that they're going through. They've been very, again, vocal about the fact that they've sort of slowed down their production as a result of some supply chain issues they've had. And obviously, there's probably just a mild amount of distraction and turbulence going on there. So we believe we've adjusted responsibly for what that production rate's going to be, and we've told you what that is. But we're not going to break it out on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis because we don't do that for any of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 14 questions for you, Clay. No, I'll keep it to one. A strategic question. I was wondering as you look at your government portfolio and the some of the challenges that the budget and the industry is facing, if there was any businesses there that you might consider selling off.","Clayton M. Jones","This is a time, Rob, where we're taking a hard look at the whole business. As I've said before, back in the halcyon days when this business was growing in double digits, we had the opportunity to do a lot of venture investing into a host of new areas, many of which were in that Surface Solutions area, because the market looked strong and we could do that. Well, times have changed. As a result of that, we're taking a very hard look at all of our portfolios to make sure we understand what is core to our business, first. Second, what we believe as this thing comes out, and eventually it'll stabilize and get back to some normal growth, and we want to be there with the kind of products that we believe our customers are going to need. That will necessarily mean that there's probably a critical fewer than we have now components of the portfolio. And again, we've already suggested one of them, where public safety is concerned, that we're not going to invest in. It's likely that we could look at others there, but again, it'd be premature for me to be any more specific than that right now.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned surface there. Is this an element of the defense market where you say things are pretty fragmented and there could be some consolidation?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, I think there's some of that, Rob. I think it's more of where Surface Solutions is targeted. And that's at the ground soldiers. And as they pull back and reduce the force structure, as the OPTEMPO reduces in Iraq and Afghanistan, there's just going to be a natural contraction in that area. Now there could still be some nuggets in there that could be highly valued and especially on the international market. Again, we're very strongly supportive of our FireStorm, and we're getting strong interest in that worldwide because it is a forward air control targeting system that allows a lot better precision. And when you're looking at ISR and precision and cyber and communication, those are areas that the Department of Defense is going to need for a variety of reasons. So our -- again, our job is to just refocus this portfolio. It's appropriate to the times, and that's exactly what we're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up kind of on Rob's question and expand it a little bit. I mean, part of it is that you have enviable margins and you've had them for a long time. But it looks like the world's getting more competitive. And could you sort of address some of the actions you're thinking about or are under consideration for taking out additional costs? Because it's clear that in some cases you probably lost some opportunities because of cost structure.","Clayton M. Jones","Yes, I guess, I would disagree with you a little bit. I don't know of many competitions we go into that we feel competitively disadvantaged, especially in our government markets. I think the fact that we have such strong synergy between commercial and government, the fact that we think fixed price and we're comfortable with fixed price, makes us cost-competitive. And the reason -- or one of the reasons we've been able to hold those high margins is because I think we start with some advantage there. But that notwithstanding, your thesis is correct. These are times when you have to match your infrastructure to the reality of the world or you will quickly become non-cost competitive or have to sacrifice your margins. And we are very intent on not doing that. And I think the Government Systems folks have shown in extraordinary circumstances, imagine that, double-digit reductions in 2 quarters in a row and they've held at 20% margin. I think kudos go to them for the work they've done. So how have they done it? Well first of all, we anticipated it and we took a number of restructuring actions last year. And those restructuring actions, like consolidating out of San Jose and closing some facilities down and relocating a lot of our manufacturing to lower cost areas, has paid off. I think the -- that they've been very aggressive in matching our headcount and our infrastructure to the realities of the programs as they've been reduced. The nice thing about what we're going through now, if you call it nice, compared to what went through third quarter of last year after the continuing resolution is nobody saw that coming. We see it coming now. And if we see it coming, we can pro-act, as well as react when it happens. And so we've been able to scale our headcount down according to what the infrastructure is. And then everything else is just using lean efficiencies by consolidating the opportunities we have and absorption on the commercial side as it's coming down on government. So we're not suffering the full absorption in our factories as a result of just our business model. So I think those are examples, Howard, of a number of things we're doing to really watch what we can control. And what we can control is that profitability, the cost of our infrastructure and the ability to throw off good cash flow, and that's what they're doing.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And then sort of related to the cash flow comment, because I do think that's very important, is the dividend increase -- could you maybe elaborate a little bit more -- I know it's been maybe 4 years since there's been a dividend increase and mostly you've been focused on share repurchase opportunistically. Is this a signal that maybe the payout ratio is going to match sort of earnings growth of 25-plus percent? Or is there an indication that you just can't find the right acquisitions to -- that are complementary at the moment?","Patrick E. Allen","Howard, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the dividend increase is consistent with our capital deployment philosophy, and we've always talked about having a dividend payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range. We were drifting down towards the bottom of that range, and so we, in consultation with our board, thought it was time to increase it. We're now back up to sort of the top end of that range. So I think it's a pattern that we followed in the past, and you're absolutely correct. We have not had an increase since 2008. But that was really more a sign of the times as opposed to a change in philosophy. So I would not read anything into our relative growth prospects from the fact that we increased the dividend. It's really just reflecting a move towards the top end of that range that we've established and long held to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Patrick, just a clarification. I guess, first, the -- so I know that the warranty adjustments within Government Systems, so combined was about $14 million in the quarter, and then there was an equal level of reserves taken at commercial?","Patrick E. Allen","There was a -- what I described is there was a $14-million reserve adjustment in government. That compares to a $9-million adjustment last year. Commercial continues to accrue customer incentives, which is another major liability for us. And that accrual actually exceeded the adjustment at government.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But is that a typical -- is that a typical accrual rate? Or is that an increased reserve?","Patrick E. Allen","I would say it's a typical accrual rate. We know we tend to be pretty conservative with how we accrue. We assume everyone's going to take advantage of those customer incentives, and we inevitably have positive adjustments from -- on that accrual as well.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So then I guess the follow-on question is that $14 million in government, it sounds like at least $6 million of it is unsustainable because it was a onetime on the JDAM. So how does the margin profile look for the rest of the year? Obviously, you have increasing volume there, but it's 200 basis points of help in the quarter.","Patrick E. Allen","I would say that we feel confident that the margin rate will increase over the course of the back half of the year because of the volume increase.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the last one, was there any change to incentive accrual because of the guidance adjustments?","Patrick E. Allen","There was. It was about $10 million. It was spread across all of the businesses and corporate...","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so was it $5 million to $6 million this quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So 2 follow-ons. The Hawker, you've got $30 million of receivables. They are the launch customer for, what, your down-scope Pro Line Fusion, your #2 biz jet customer. Maybe tell us what are you doing to kind of bound your exposure to kind of taking further negative hits as a result of their situation?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we're staying very close to the situation, Cai. Obviously, we stay in discussion with them as to what both their requirements are for shipments and their financial health. And I would say, those have been, I think, very candid and transparent discussions. So first, we're just staying apprised as best as we can of what they're doing and what their options are. Relative to what we're doing to prepare for that, we're going to act responsibly depending on what their circumstances are. They've been very good about paying their bills. If that changes, obviously, we'd have to review where our situation is on that. So I think we're doing what we need to be doing right now, Cai, to be ready for that. One of the difficulties and uncertainties is exactly how and when they're going to come out of this. But one thing we do know is they have parts of their portfolio, which fortunately are the parts we believe that we are strongest on, which are very fungible and which are in some demand in the marketplace. So however they do that, we believe somebody's going to be making airplanes and they're going to be selling them and our stuff is going to be on them. And so we just have to kind of sort our way through that as they move down that path.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And then kind of on the plus side, you mentioned FireStorm is a $40 million out of this year because it's moved to the right, but now it's bigger. So should we be adding an incremental $50 million to Surface Solutions next year? And can Surface Solutions actually be up next year, despite the wind down in Iraq and Afghanistan?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we'll have to wait and see what next year holds there, Cai. All we know is that this customer is very committed to this product. They've reassured us of that. I would say that this delay, as you get into when you're dealing with a number of foreign countries, they have their own system. They have their own approval processes. And more importantly, we're always subject to export requirements and paperwork. And that's what's really holding this up. I think Kelly Ortberg, when he spoke this past quarter, made it very clear that we needed that order by about the end of March, first of April in order for it to convert in the year. And it's not because we can't build them that fast; it's because we can't get all the appropriate export\/import approvals fast enough to assure that we can actually deliver that product. So if you're looking for a holdup, that's it. It's this inevitable paperwork thing. So it's not lack of interest in the product. And I think as we go along, one of the things that was a catalyst for the delay is that they had 2 separate orders that they were looking at, 1 firm, 1 option. They've decided now to pick up that option and combine these 2 into a single buy. So they still want it. It's still going to happen. It's going to be now in next year, and we'll wait and see how big it gets there, Cai.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A lot has been asked, so I thought maybe I'd touch on this new China joint venture that you have with AVIC and the new Avionics company. I know the focus is on the COMAC 919, but I thought maybe you can make some comments here if this covers any other platforms besides the 919. Also, when do you expect approval from the Chinese government? Are you developing technology jointly with AVIC that could be used in other markets? And finally, are you also looking at other JVs?","Clayton M. Jones","Okay, let me see if I can answer all the parts of that one. Well, first of all, the one we signed, if you recall, is the surveillance system one with LETRI. We still have another. We're negotiating for the communication navigation systems that we're providing over there. We -- the focus is initially on the 919, as you suggest. However, while we're over there at our meetings with both AVIC and COMAC, and most especially with AVIC, because this joint venture, this LETRI organization is a subsidiary of AVIC, we did talk about other markets and some advantages. As we all know, China is very interested in moving into business aviation in some way. And they're very interested, again, in our Pro Line Fusion and what we can bring to them in terms of product and synergy into that market, so we talked about that some. And we already have a relationship with them in the regional market on the ARJ21. So I think as the aviation market grows in China, we are very well positioned to grow with that. And these joint ventures are only one arm of the many channels that I think we are establishing into China. We have to remember, we've been in China for 28 years. We've been dealing with AVIC for 23 years since our first formal agreement with them. They know us well, and I think there -- other opportunities present themselves, Rockwell Collins will be there, we hope, to be a part of that. Relative to the joint venture, most of the joint venture, as we've said before, is focusing on systems integration and certification of our product into the COMAC 919. It is not involved with both design and production of the product itself. That will still be done in United States in our current factories. And so they're focusing on the thing where they need to build more expertise, which is on those integration and certification areas. And that's where the predominant focus of the joint venture is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to get back to the government margins. And I can appreciate, Clay, that later in the year, your volume goes up. That's going to help. But just thinking a little bit more longer run or intermediate term going into next year and the year after, we're in this down trend obviously with the budget. You had some help this quarter from declining sales. At some point, your sales are going to stop going down. They're going to flatten out at some point and you're not going to have maybe some of the help. You can't lower R&D forever. The warranty reserves can't come down forever. Do you still think you can sustain 20% in this business?","Clayton M. Jones","I do. I'm very confident we can do that if conditions remain as they are right now, Joe. Well, first of all, when it plateaus or starts to stabilize, we won't need to lower R&D anymore. We won't need to reduce warranty anymore because, as Pat very well pointed out, those sort of come with the territory. You end products, you have -- you produce less of them, you need less warranty, and so we're making those prudent reserves as a result of that. I think that can be overplayed, and I don't think it's necessary to be done. The back half of the year is not as strong as we thought it was going to be, but positive growth is like manna from heaven over there. Not a lot of companies in defense are going to see positive growth for a while. And so the fact that were going to have a couple of quarters of it is -- now we got balloons being built and rockets going on up there because now you actually have some tailwind going to help you sustain those margins. And I think you'll see stronger margins attendant to that as you would expect to see over Government Systems. As we move forward, I see the dynamics such that we can do it because, number one, as I said before, we're going to focus our portfolio on those things that we do best, where we have best market positions, where we have a lot of commercial content. And we have a lot of fixed price in commercial terms contracted, which is what generates the margin there. We're also going to focus on a lot of international opportunities. And international opportunities, we think, will be again more to those kind of products that already come with good high margins. So if we can execute our strategic plans and move the portfolio and our sales into the area where there are opportunities, controlling what we can control with infrastructure, we do believe right now, absent some other extraneous situation or a 15% or 20% decline that might be caused by sequestration, that we can hold those margins in that area.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, Patrick, just on the cash flow. It's definitely second half-weighted and you said that previously and we see that. Can you walk through what the moving parts are on working capital in the second half of the year and just how we get to your guidance? And then specifically, on inventory, do you still expect to hold inventory growth to 0 x preproduction?","Patrick E. Allen","Yes, and that's obviously one of the major moving parts to the cash flow. What we typically see and what we're planning on again this year is back half of the year, much higher sales brings inventory down. We have higher receivable collections. And all of that -- and we don't have things like pension payments and incentive compensation payments. And so when you put that all into the mix, it indicates that there should be an awful lot higher cash flow in the back of the year, particularly as a percentage of net income. So I still feel confident that we'll reach our cash flow goals. We are planning on having relatively flat inventory x preproduction engineering, and that hasn't changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Probably for you, Patrick. The commercial incremental margin was like 64%, and I know you guys have high incrementals. But that seems extraordinarily high. Was there any benefit in there? Or what caused it to be that high this quarter?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, what I'd say, there were a couple of small things, George. There was a little bit of a -- we had an intellectual property sale that came at a very high margin, about a couple of million dollars there. And there was a couple of million dollars of benefit from incentive compensation as a result of the reduction of our sales guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yair Rainier with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The 787 appears to be trickling out to the airlines a bit more slowly than originally planned. Can you discuss how that could potentially impact provisioning as you move through the year? And maybe to what extent you've built any risk around that into your forecast for the back half?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, obviously, the rate of delivery really does impact their need to provision for spares. And the way I would say it is, it's not the volume of 787s delivered, but it's the number of airlines that they're delivered to. And so long as they're operating 1 or 5, they're going to need some spares to support that aircraft. What we see happening is that Boeing is delivering according to their schedule. If there's some vagary back and forth to that, then that -- we'll adjust to that. What I will say is that for our plans for the year, most of those spares decisions have been made. And so what -- in our forecast for the balance of the year, as you're looking in the aftermarket, you'll see less impact to those sparing decisions because a lot of those have already been made and delivered. And as we go through this, I would say, transition to the next airline that's taking them, we're expecting that to sort of be on a slowing trajectory for the balance of this year and then hopefully, again, pick up next year. We said very clearly, there's going to be some lumpiness to this as a function of 2 things: the airlines they deliver to and who makes those decisions, as you suggest; and also whether they choose power by the hour or they choose to buy the spares out right. So anybody that's drawing a straight line on spares provisioning is making a big mistake because I can guarantee you, it won't work like that. And so you're going to have to just kind of track it across there. But at least, I can tell you that we've got most of those sort of on the books for the year and we're counting on fewer for the balance of the year.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then one more if I could. You mentioned the impact you're going to have in terms of the top line from cutting investment in public safety vehicle systems. Can you give us a sense of what the impact, good or bad, will be in terms of the operating profit for the year?","Patrick E. Allen","The only thing I'd tell you is that that public safety specifically came at very low margins, so the impact of that is not going to be significant.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So in terms of margin, it's probably a beneficial?","Patrick E. Allen","Marginally, a little bit, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Patrick, just, Clay, back on the 787, you've been running ahead of Boeing on the OE side at 4 per month. What is the typical lead time for you on a program like this that's ramping up aggressively?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, if this was a typical run rate for Boeing, we typically get 2 orders a year, about every 6 months. So they'll look at their skyline chart. They'll give us a slug of orders for what they're delivering, say, 6 months hence. And then we get another slug in another 6 months. This is anything but that right now because of the relative volatility of that program. So at some point, we'll get to that. As I've said before, we're going to expect to be holding at this 4-per-month rate into next fiscal year. And that at whatever time Boeing has begun to use up that cash of deliveries, then we'll begin to start synchronizing with them as they ramp up to their 10 per month. And right now, I can't tell you when that's going to be.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, a follow-up on aftermarket. Are you seeing any material changes or anything international versus domestic? And I guess, I'm just thinking of Europe here. Just given the economic weakness, are you seeing anything changes there on the air transport side?","Clayton M. Jones","Nothing significant. You can't call it that close as we're seeing there now. We're seeing -- again, aftermarket is good worldwide right now and it's good mainly because in the MRO, people are flying the airplanes a lot and the passenger traffic is still remaining strong worldwide. And so that's the big MRO driver. In terms of retrofits, upgrades, I'd mentioned again that the initial provisioning is the biggest driver, but we are always looking at upgrades and retrofits to various programs. We've got a very nice one now with FedEx that we're doing that will drive that a little while. So there are things like that that come along all the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Wedbush.","Kenneth Herbert - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the margin question for the Commercial Systems segment. Obviously, it sounds like, in the quarter, you had a couple of one-time items but the incrementals were very strong. Is this a run rate that we should expect considering the guidance and considering what you've talked about, about the outlook for regional equipment in the aftermarket within the commercial side moving forward?","Patrick E. Allen","I think it's fair to say you're going to see continued margin expansion. Now as you think about the incremental margins, I'd say -- I've reiterated this a lot. We tend to run about 40% to 50% incremental margins, sometimes a little bit higher than that based on product mix. As I mentioned, we had an intellectual property sale this quarter which improved the mix. But 40% to 50% incremental margins is what you should be thinking about going forward.","Kenneth Herbert - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And for the -- again for the commercial segment, I mean, you're starting to hopefully now get into a bit more of a sweet spot, as volumes on the original equipment side continue to pick up and aftermarket continues to evolve here. What -- just more strategically, when you go out 1 to 2 years, what can margins in this business get to? Or is there anything we should think about in terms of sort of absolute upside here?","Patrick E. Allen","Well, I think you'll absolutely see continued margin expansion as long as sales continue to go up. Now I'd hate to predict the peak of those margins, because it all depends upon where the top line goes and how fast it gets there, but I think there's still an awful lot of potential for margin expansion in this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, Clay, just a follow-up on maybe what Peter was asking about the aftermarket. It sounds like you've got a very good comfort level and handle on the sparing opportunities. When you're planning for the remainder of the year, some of the uncertainty -- you mentioned Europe with high fuel prices. We've seen a lot of airline bankruptcies. How do you kind of navigate those challenges? And sort of -- are you -- do you anticipate the strength in your general sparing outside the initial provisioning to continue on a go-forward basis here?","Clayton M. Jones","Yes, I think for example, we model the MRO side pretty closely with flight hours, as I mentioned before. And that's relatively predictable. We can see that. Obviously, the most difficult thing we do is the discretionary part of the aftermarket. Some of that where we have given programs for modifications and retrofits, either in the business jet world or air transport, we can relatively predict, although if the airline gets -- times get tight, they can turn it off, turn it on, delay it. So there's still some vagary on that. And then there's always drop-in things that you see that people want to do. Again, this occurs more in the business jet world when someone is going to make a retrofit or upgrade to a display or to an information management system or put a new system on there. Those are the most wildly unpredictable. We try to talk to our dealers, our end customers to get a good sense of that, and then we just model as best we can. That's why I go back to my point of on a year-to-year basis, we can probably get a good sense of it. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, you almost can't call it accurately that close just because of the vagary of the decision in the discretionary side.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just the last one. Can you characterize how the defense -- your defense bookings were in the quarter? Did you see...","Clayton M. Jones","Well, let me put it this way. We see our booking flow going fairly efficiently. And that's a relative term when you're dealing with government, as you know. But I know that we've heard some talk about some slowdown or some inefficiency in orders, which we saw big time last year, and maybe that's what we're comparing it to, after CR. We're not really seeing that. We're seeing contracting activity kind of occur as we would expect it to. We're not seeing any inordinate shift and slowdown to that order flow from the U.S. government. International, different story, as I've talked about here. So we've not, at least, seen that dynamic play to a great deal.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Carter Leake with BB&T Capital Markets.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Navigation Products, down 37%, but we pretty much expected that. I think, in the past, you spoke that this could sort of be a bottom. Is that still true? Or could you provide any color on when we might see growth in nav products?","Clayton M. Jones","As you know, most of that, Carter, is being driven by the DAGR reduction. I don't think we're at the bottom yet. I think the biggest comparable occurred in the first half of this year, and so I'd say the biggest percentage change is behind us. But I expect there to be decline in that portfolio through the balance of the year as the inevitable -- as you chase the comparable, if you will, from the strong DAGR sales from the previous years. And so they're going to get down to whatever sustainable is, and I don't think we have a firm grip on what that is right now. So let me say, we're comfortable with the guidance we've given for that portfolio in the total year reduction, and we don't see any big change to that. And if you can say anything about that, that 25% reduction has occurred about like we thought it would. So I don't see any big changes there.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. On Hawker, how about just looking at aftermarket incumbent platforms? Is the King Air your largest exposure on aftermarket with them?","Clayton M. Jones","On aftermarket, I don't know if I can give you a firm answer to that, Carter. And I don't want to give you an answer I've not well studied. I can tell you it's the largest exposure on the OE side. But in terms of aftermarket sales, I'd have to go research that a little bit. I can't answer that.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And just one more quick one. You spoke about the KC-390. You're optimistic about that, and you also said there are opportunities with the Brazilian MoD. Is that in concert with Embraer? Or is that exclusive and separated, if you will, almost in competition with Embraer?","Clayton M. Jones","Well, we're definitely not in competition with Embraer. Embraer is the systems integrator. It's sort of the Boeing Airbus of Brazil, if you will. And they're assuming that role and obviously have been very successful doing it. And so what I would say is most of the sales that we've had in the airborne area have been in concert with Embraer, working with them, and frankly have extended from the excellent relationship that we have with them on the legacy platforms that we've been working on with Pro Line Fusion. And so that's there. The other -- the importance of the MoD relationship is that there are a number of communications and other military systems platforms that Brazil is aggressively pursuing as it gears up for the World Cup and the Olympics and basically just being a bigger player on the global stage, that we believe are opening up to us with some of our other competencies as we use this initial KC program to strengthen the relationship. We think that can bridge itself to some other opportunities.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Chris, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today's call is being webcast, and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide two of this webcast presentation, and from time-to-time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. This is really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses. Among the market highlights was the C Series' entry into service with Swissair. We're very pleased to see Bombardier accomplish this major milestone, and it's a real time that this program is turning the corner. As you know, this has been a big investment for us, and we're all pleased to be moving from the investment phase to the return phase for this program.","Another major OEM accomplishment was the successful refueling test with the KC-46 tanker, paving the way towards production of that airplane. These are both important programs for our long-term growth in our Commercial and Government businesses.","Annually, both Boeing and Airbus survey the airlines to gauge their supplier performance and customer support, and recently, it was announced that Rockwell Collins was ranked number one for both Airbus and Boeing. In fact, we're ranked ahead of both of the OEMs themselves. I'm very proud of our team's performance, which is a testament to our brand promise of building trust every day, and will help us to continue to be the supplier of choice in our markets.","Overall, we executed our business quite well during the quarter, delivering solid margin performance, while also stepping up our R&D spending in Commercial Systems to support the development of the 777X. We also make great progress in booking the Government orders necessary to achieve our abnormally large second half sales plan. And our IMS business grew 10%, and we achieved our expected growth in the non-aviation segment, which demonstrates that some of our strategies to grow that portion of the business are beginning to take traction.","Now, we're not without challenges and they seem to be focused in our Commercial Systems markets right now. The business aviation end market continues to struggle to find the bottom. This last quarter, we saw shaky utilization, and recently, we've seen even further declines in demand from the OEMs. If you recall, we started the year with some discount in OEM production, and we saw reduced demand at the beginning of the calendar year, which used up our discount and then some. I was hoping to see demand stabilize through the summer, but unfortunately, this hasn't been the case. This is going to further impact our top line in Commercial Systems.","Just to give you a \u2013 some color on this, it's not really specific to any particular airplane type, but rather an overall market condition. We're seeing softness in product demand across all major business jet manufacturers. Recall that we moved our fiscal 2016 guidance back to the fourth quarter earnings call to allow us to get better aligned with the OEMs. And I think this is going to be really applicable to the biz jet demand this year. It's not yet clear to us how these latest changes from the OEMs will impact their 2017 demand. And I'm sure that they're going to be moderating the next quarter of market dynamics before they set that outlook.","In addition, we've had another quarter of no growth in air transport MRO. And in the last earnings call, I indicated that I believe this is a structural change to our aftermarket due to the component recycling practices at the airlines. So if you couple the business aviation OEM and the air transport aftermarket sales environments, we're lowering our Commercial Systems sales forecast for the year from up single digits to down about 1%.","On a more positive note, as I mentioned earlier, Government Systems has a \u2013 had a nice quarter in sales and earnings, but has an even bigger fourth quarter yet to go, and I \u2013 as I've done in the last couple calls, I'd like to give you some granularity on how we're progressing in capturing the business to achieve that growth.","During the last quarterly call, I said that 77% of the second half growth was either in backlog or coming from annual follow-on buys. This is now at 94% at the end of the third quarter. So, I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the sales growth that we projected and finish the year strong. Some of these sales will be later in the year than we originally planned, and it's going to stress our ability to collect cash by year end, and that's a contributor to us adjusting our guidance on cash flow to the lower end of our previous range.","So, to summarize, before Patrick takes you through the details of the quarter, we really executed well this past quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see the restructuring savings flowing as we expected, and we are successfully bringing in the Government business needed to accomplish the abnormally large second half ramp.","Business aviation remains a challenge for us as the industry is still searching for the bottom of the market. And I continue to see good things from our IMS business, and we're making good progress on the new OEM programs that will set us up for future growth.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on slide three, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.","Total company's sales for the quarter increased $41 million or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales. Income from continuing operations increased $36 million or 20%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.30 or 23% compared to the same period last year.","The increase in income in earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense that was favorably impacted by the release of a valuation allowance related to a capital loss carry forward, as well as higher pre-tax earnings from the higher sales.","As we turn to slide four, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $612 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $6 million or 2% to $367 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, lower product deliveries to a Chinese regional jet manufacturer, and lower Airbus A330 production rates. This was mostly offset by higher deliveries in support of the A350 and Boeing 787 production rate ramps, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, higher Bombardier C Series sales in support of bids entering to service this year, and higher customer funded development program revenues.","After market sales increased to $11 million or 5% due to higher simulation hardware deliveries, inorganic sales from the acquisition of International Communications Group, and higher flight-deck retrofits, partially offset by lower spares provisioning and lower cabin retrofits.","And Commercial Systems operating earnings were flat at $141 million, and operating earnings were about flat at 23%. Operating earnings and margins were flat with the prior year as benefits from the cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans were offset by unfavorable sales mix as lower margin customer funded development sales increased and higher margin business jet OEM sales decreased.","Moving on to slide five, Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $555 million, driven by higher fixed-wing platform revenues and higher simulation training sales, partially offset by lower deliveries of various rotary wing platforms, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program, and lower international deliveries of targeting systems.","Government Systems' third quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $115 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.7%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings resulted from a higher sales volume and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by unfavorable development program adjustments.","Turning to slide six, Information Management Services sales increased 10% over the prior year as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 9%, while the non-aviation related businesses increased 11%, primarily due to higher airport and rail program sales. Information Management Services' third quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $26 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.6% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings with a higher sales volume.","Looking next to slide seven, we show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow compared to $341 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted primarily from the timing of sales and lower advance payments from our customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.","Slide eight provides an update to our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $731 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 to $741 (sic) [$714] million year-to-date in fiscal 2016. Company-funded R&D decreased $47 million due to lower business jet development costs in Commercial Systems and lower software-defined radio development costs in Government Systems.","Customer-funded research and development expense increased $25 million due to higher development costs for international regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems.","Pre-production engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems and the Global 7000\/8000 program, partially offset by lower spend on the C Series program.","Moving to slide nine, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2 from 1.7 at year end. The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first three quarters of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year, and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the quarter is detailed on slide 10. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average cost of $90.71. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $125 million.","Now, to move to slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as we enter the last fiscal quarter of the year. Total sales are now expected to be about $5.3 billion, which is the bottom of the previously guided range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion.","As Kelly discussed in his opening remarks, we've updated Commercial Systems sales to be down about 1 percentage point this year due to softness in business jet OEM deliveries, as well as muted market conditions in air transport service and support. We have narrowed the earnings per share guidance to $5.50 to $5.55, which is within the previously guided range of $5.45 to $5.65.","We've also updated our cash flow from operations outlook to be about $750 million, which is at the bottom of the previously guided range, due primarily to the timing of receivable collections and higher pre-production engineering spend. Our guidance for total segment operating margins, research and development investment, and capital expenditures is unchanged from the previous guidance.","With that, that's the end of my review of the financial results and projections. So, Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we'll answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Pete Skibitski, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Sorry about that. Good morning, guys.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Can you add some comments to introduce about kind of weak biz jet conditions across the board. But are you seeing anything incrementally at the high end versus the low end? Can you maybe talk about it in terms of cabin size and how exposed are you to the Dassault cut of announced last week?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me answer the last part first. Dassault, we primarily do cabin equipment for Dassault, so those aren't super heavy content aircraft for us, but we are exposed to that. We're seeing it really across all categories of aircraft. As I said in the comments, it really \u2013 I can't point right now to, this is a heavy phenomenon or median or life phenomenon. It's really across the board. I think everybody has gotten through another quarter. It's not been an overly good quarter in terms of the end markets, and I think everybody is truing up their outlook for the balance of the year. As I mentioned, I'd hoped that we get through the summer. But we were clear to point out that the summertime, if they're going to adjust their rates, we're probably going to hear about it, and unfortunately, we have been hearing about it from all of them.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Okay. Got it. I'll honor the one question. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Patrick, I was wondering if you could touch on the cash flow for a second. So, the pre-production expectation for this year versus the $100 million net increase previously, what's the number this year and are you on track for that to normalize?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Yeah, Myles, I want to tell you it's going to be about $125 million this year. We're seeing a little bit higher spending on 737 MAX as that program accelerates, and we're also seeing a little bit less amortization on the Government Systems side due to some lower deliveries on helicopter programs, and those are the two things that are driving that net investment up to probably, roughly, $125 million.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then next year, in terms of what that holds into next year, is it a zero or is it a positive?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think we'll see a significant reduction next year, and I think \u2013 I wouldn't view the increase this year as a carry through to next year. So, it should be a \u2013 should be incrementally positive tailwind next year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But don't want to size it right now?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I \u2013 we're still in the middle of our planning process. So, I don't want to size it specifically right now, no.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. I will take the one.","Operator","The next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Patrick, on that cash flow, can you also talk about \u2013 you had talked about CapEx being about $200 million, that would imply you need to get something like $67 million in the fourth quarter. Why would we expect to see such a large ramp-up?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, that's a good question, Sam. I think there may be a little bit of opportunity in our CapEx number. We typically \u2013 if you go \u2013 you have to go back a couple of years, but if you go back a couple of years, we've typically been a little bit more backend loaded on our CapEx. I don't think that's been true over the last couple of years, but typically, it has been backend loaded. But is there a little bit opportunity in CapEx? I think there might be.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And can you size that unfavorable development program adjustment in Government Systems?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It was about $6 million and related to the, I would call it the wind up of a international development program we had some unanticipated cost on.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Kelly, just wanted to see if you could expand a little bit on that \u2013 the business jet market comment you made. Do you think that the sort of summer season furlough weakness is one of these moves that's kind of sufficient to get right sized or is your thought process here, we're still looking for whatever comes next behind that?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Carter, I can't see any conditions at this point to say, hey, that's it, we're at the bottom, the market continues to struggle. What I said in my opening remarks was it's not clear to us yet how these adjustments that we just recently received are going to impact their long-term or particularly their 2017 production rate. My assumption sitting here today would be if we don't see some sort of a market improvement, that these adjustments are going to set us \u2013 set to go in \u2013 production rates going into next year. Hopefully, that will at least give us a stable base going forward, unless the market conditions continue to erode.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So is it safe to say that you're planning accordingly given that lack of visibility to have the flexibility in case it needs to be lower as well?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as Pat said, we're in the middle of putting together our 2017 plan right now. I think we're going to be pretty conservative in our outlook, which I thought we were coming into this fiscal year, we've put the discount there, and it turned out even that was too optimistic. So, yeah, we're all looking for the bottom. I think when you're looking for the bottom, you're going to tend to plan pretty conservatively and hope for upside.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the color, Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, everyone. Kelly, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes and talk a little bit about your mid- to longer-term revenue earnings goals in the context of all the puts and takes that you're seeing. Maybe highlight for us \u2013 we talked here on this call about some of the downside risks, but maybe provide a little bit of an update on the key drivers for growth that may allow us to get to that mid- to long-term growth targets that you've got for both revenue and earnings.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think, first of all, the linearity of that long-term outlook certainly hasn't been what we expected. And there have been puts and takes, both positive and negative. I think we're, in the short-term, dealing with a lot of the negative, which is delays in entry into service of programs, a lower aftermarket MRO component than we originally expected, and a much, much weaker business aviation demand than we anticipated.","On the positive side, we've gained additional share on the 777X. We've seen increases in production rates in narrow body aircraft, significant increases in production rates on narrow body aircraft. Of course, we've got the new, a lot of new positions with the MAX and the 777X are cutting in. That's not necessarily new, but continue to be growth drivers for us. And then we planned our defense business at that time at a sequester level, and currently, the budget environment is clearly better than that. So, our ability to grow for our Government business is certainly a little bit better.","I think as I look at that outlook and how are we doing against it, obviously, 2016, we're not achieving that, the top level numbers. 2017, I think we're going to have to take a hard look at business aviation; it's the wild card for us. If we can just get that business to stabilize, I think we can grow the company. If you \u2013 you put it in perspective, business aviation, OEM is about 20% to 25% of our commercial revenues or about 10% of the company revenues. And so, if we can get that to flat, we can grow the company. The challenge is, quarters like this one where we've got 22% decline in business aviation is offsetting a lot of really good growth for us. And the Information Management business, I think, continues to track pretty well to our original plan.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. I have a two-part question on business jets. First, all of the manufacturers reporting have cited pricing as being particularly weak because of the erosion in the pre-owned market. Are you seeing any negative pricing pressures?","And secondly, usually, when OE is off and prices of pre-owns come down, you start to see a pick-up in pre-own sales that tends to bolster the aftermarket. Are you seeing any positive signs or potential positive signs in biz jet aftermarket?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the biz jet aftermarket has been pretty good for us for the whole year. We continue to see good retrofit activity in avionics, which I do view as a positive sign. Last year, it was probably more focused on cabin upgrades and nobody was upgrading the frontend of the airplane, but now, we're seeing that and that's continued through this quarter. Regarding pricing pressure, I think our near-term pricing is pretty fixed relative to the market. So, I think the OEMs have to deal with that. They're certainly turning around and looking to the supply chain to help them in any way, but that's not unique to the business aviation market.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the \u2013 in the air transport aftermarket, what happened at Intertrade in the quarter, and also, what the contribution was from the acquisitions that you did in 2015? Just to get a sense of kind of where the organic business is. It seems we've faced some pressure here before and we've talked about some of the causes, but it seems to be gathering some strength, and just kind of wondering if you have any insight into why that's the case.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, if you look at the \u2013 if you peel the onion way back, I'd say in air transport, our MRO \u2013 just core MRO, not used components \u2013 was down low single-digit, and that was offset by some Intertrade growth for the quarter. As far as the inorganic growth, it's primarily coming out of our ICG acquisition, which is the \u2013 a satellite-based communications equipment. I think about $4 million of ICG growth was in the air transport and another $2 million was in biz jet.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And just, does \u2013 do you get a sense that the structural pressure that you've talked about in the commercial air transport aftermarket has been gathering steam? Just because it seems like retirements have been moderating and traffic growth has been fairly solid, but it does seem like these headwinds have been increasing.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think they have for \u2013 certainly, for our portfolio, if you look at our installed base, it's heavily leveraged on 757, 767, and 747-400. And while we have seen retirements abate a bit, it's been propped more in the narrow bodies, which is not as significant of an installed base today for us because we don't have flight decks in the narrow bodies. So, our portfolio is feeling probably a little bit more of the impact of recycling, and that's coming in two ways. We don't get the repair action through our service center, but also, we're seeing lower, what I'll call legacy spares where someone's just buying a legacy product because they're able to fill that spare with the used component.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, Kelly, I just want to pursue a little bit more of the business jet market, because while Bombardier and Embraer's deliveries are down, Cessna actually had quite a decent increase in their deliveries in the second quarter. So, is some of your comments related to the fact that on the newer Cessna products, you don't have the market share that you used to have?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think at Cessna, you do have to go look at the mix. I think we have a mix \u2013 I think they were \u2013 King Air deliveries were reported down quite a bit. And, of course, we have the King Air position. So \u2013 and we don't own some of the new growth platforms down there. So, I do think that's a little bit of a mix issue at Cessna.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. I had a question and clarification. Patrick, on the clarification on the cash flow, is there any component of that, that is on the commercial side maybe in terms of receivables from some of your OEM customers in terms of timing on their payables? And then, Kelly, on the cabin retrofit and some of the weakness there, could you speak a \u2013 talk to that a little bit, where are you seeing that and what's the dynamic behind that?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me take the first part of your question, Rob. I think it's fair to say that we always have puts and takes with respect to cash flow timing, particularly at yearend, because it \u2013 a day or two days can mean quite a bit in terms of our cash flow. So, that's always a risk and an opportunity. I wouldn't say that we have anything specifically baked in with respect to commercial OEM, I'll say, paying behavior. So, \u2013 and, yeah, we'll continue to monitor it, but no, there is nothing specific to commercial payment practices.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No one has made an effort, Patrick? No one's made an effort to change payable terms?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I didn't say that. I think we have a couple of our larger customers have been very active in terms of talking to us about cash flow payment terms and we're continuing to negotiate that. But I would tell you that we're still working it.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Look, Boeing, we do not have a Boeing re-plan in terms of their payment strategy in our full year outlook. That's not in accordance with our contracts that we have with them, so we're expecting them to withhold that. I will say quarter-to-date, Boeing is delinquent and Boeing has contributed to some of our underperformance here this quarter in cash flow, which is disappointing, but we're working that with them.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then just on the retrofit.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Rob, yeah, Rob, on the retrofits, I don't know whether I can point to anything marketwise. It truly is we're just seeing when the airplanes are coming in for engine mods or maintenance actions that we're selling more avionics and less cabin. It appears to be they kind of have a fixed amount of money, and the money is shifting a little bit towards the avionics upgrades. I don't know if that's because they think they need those avionics upgrades to sell the airplane. Some of them are mandated kind of things and they're just saying, let's go ahead and do them right now; might be indicative of them keeping the aircraft longer. Now, cabin upgrades haven't gone away. They were just particularly strong last quarter, and they're not as strong here through this year.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I want to shift a little bit towards some new products, Kelly. Two things; one is you highlighted the simulator business and demand. Is there something that's changed permanently, I mean, given the pilot shortage? And then just very briefly touch on, you have 737 MAX, you have C Series and A350 all ramping fairly substantially next year. Could you elaborate a little bit on the trajectory?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you look at the ramp-ups next year, you're right on the ramps. If you look at 737 MAX, that's going to feather in over probably about three-year timeframe as they transition from NG to MAX. At Boeing next year, while I'm not \u2013 I don't have a plan yet that I'm sitting in front of, I would expect that we'll see the MAX tailwind be offset by declines in the 777 and the 747-8. So they'll tend to mute themself in fiscal 2017, but then we'll see the incremental growth in 2018 and 2019 as we continue to feather in the MAX.","I think we're all watching Airbus's ramp-up on A350. Right now, we're pretty well aligned with their public guidance there, but I think everybody is watching to see if they're going to be able to achieve that going forward. So hopefully, we'll get some more clarity before we have to provide any guidance on 2017.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And as it relates to the simulator products, I would say those products tend to be a little bit lumpy just in terms of the timing of the deliveries. I wouldn't read into it in terms of a, I'll say, a permanent change to the trajectory of that business. It still remains to be a pretty good business. We still anticipate good growth in that business, but I think it was a little bit unusual this quarter.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","So, there is no share gain or anything else that you can point to, Patrick?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think there are probably a fair amount of deliveries across the board. Actually, there were a lot of deliveries in the Commercial side of the business for some simulator products. I don't think there was a lot of share gain, though.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to shift gears again to the Government Systems. You had good growth in the quarter and I know it's consistent with what you've been talking about and it sounds like the full year outlook remains on track. Can you specifically, two parts, specifically highlight any more detail on specific programs you saw ramping this quarter or any other color on the specific strength here? And then second, can you provide an update on the Manpack opportunity? I know the radios are getting tested now and any further detail on when you are looking for the potential down select there and any update on the testing process? Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, let me hit Manpack first of all. Yeah, we've delivered the units, as have the competitors, and they're in the test process. I'm probably not going to be providing you much detailed information. It's highly competitive between now and the down selection, so, I'm not going to be speaking too much anymore about what's going on relative to Manpack.","We do expect the down select to be towards the end of the second quarter, early third quarter of next fiscal year. As far as government programs, if you look in the third quarter, we saw some pretty good growth in military simulation and training. Our E-6 program had some good growth, and international P-3s also. We saw continued decline year-on-year in rotary wing, primarily driven by the oil and gas challenges that we've been dealing with. If you look towards the fourth quarter, I think you're going to see pretty good growth across our entire Government portfolio. In fact, I think our COMM\/NAV portfolio will probably exceed our avionics portfolio in terms of overall growth, where key programs there are international C-130s, and we've done a good job of booking those.","You may have seen a press release where we won a Black Hawk simulator program down in Mexico. That was one of those that we had planned to win and convert in the year. We've got growth in F-35, continued growth in E-6, and then some simulation and training products that we're expecting to grow. So, again, a pretty big fourth quarter, abnormally big fourth quarter for us in our Government portfolio, but pretty much the majority of that is booked and now executing, and I expect that we'll have really a bang up quarter here for our Government business, which is good. This is the first, this Q3 was the first quarter of growth in quite a few quarters here for our Government business. So, it's good to get that finally turning in the right direction.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David. Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Kelly, want to see if you could touch on this trajectory of company funded R&D as we head into 2017. I think you had \u2013 you spoken previously about 2017 looking a lot more like fiscal 2015 rather than 2016 in terms of company funded R&D. If you could touch on that and then also touch on, assuming that on the company funded side, along with the increase in preproduction amortization, it looks like it's going to be tough for Commercial Systems EBIT to grow even if you were to assume that business share were \u2013 was flat in 2017. If you could just touch on that. Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, the first half of this year has been a low half in terms of Commercial Systems' company funded R&D, and you're seeing us ramp that up here in the third quarter. You'll see additional ramp-up in the fourth quarter. So, I think while, again, I don't have 2017's detailed plan, I think 2017, you can expect us to be spending kind of more at the rate at which we're ramping to right now. Obviously, the more expensed R&D that we spend on the year, the more challenge that places on our Government revenues. I wouldn't say that's necessarily \u2013 I'm sorry, Commercial margin. I wouldn't necessarily say that's new. We've always known that we were going to be ramping back up the R&D, and we've got to go drive the good news out of the product profitability in order to offset that R&D ramp.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, maybe if we could just go back to the Government Systems, you were hitting on it. Best quarter of growth, I think, since fiscal 2011. Fourth quarter looks to be strong, you've got some easy comps in the first half. I mean, are we out of the woods here based on current visibility, what you're seeing in the pipeline programs? I mean, can we expect Government Systems to start putting up consistent year-over-year growth at this point? Or from your perspective, is it too early to call?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","No. I think you can't start to see that we're going to have consistent year-on-year growth coming out of our Government portfolio. Now, it \u2013 we \u2013 this year is strange because we had the first half, second half. I don't think you should assume that we're going to continue to grow at this second half rate. But what we've said was to get flat in 2015, low single-digit growth coming out, and I think the budget environment is going to allow us over the next couple of years to move that growth rate to a low single-digit to mid single-digit growth out of our Government portfolio, which is upside from our long-term outlook, as I talked about before.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And just if I may, are there headwinds out there when I think about maybe the Brazilian economy, the KC-390? Are there specific programs you might be more worried about creating some unforeseen headwinds in Government?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the KC-390 is going to go through some challenging times going forward. I think that we've got that baked into our overall outlook. I think oil and gas continues to be a question mark for civil helo. But the areas where we're expecting growth, I think that's why I highlighted KC-46, really important growth program for us; F-35 appears very solid and that's a good growth program for us. And then back to the comment on the Manpack program, that's an important program that we'll start driving growth here probably towards the end of next year and into the following year. So we've got the programs and the opportunities ahead of us to have this business on a continuous growth trajectory.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys, helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks. Kelly, Patrick, Ryan, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So, I wanted to ask about mandates. If I missed your comments about this when you made it before, I apologize. I know that MRO activity isn't generally a big revenue driver for you, but I believe it could drive cockpit mandates. So, I wanted to get a sense from you, how things like D-checks are trending. Are you seeing more D-check schedules? If you're more expecting more mandate activity in the future, how things are looking there?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I probably can't comment because I haven't looked at specifically on D-check schedules. The only thing I can say is that we \u2013 for mandates, we do typically \u2013 especially for the large fleet operators, they try to get those mandates incorporated into their scheduled maintenance outlook. And we saw that with the TCAS, changes here in the past two years. We've got the ADS-B mandate mostly ahead of us. We're actually expecting some initial revenues in both their transport and government biz jets out of ADS-B here in the fourth quarter. So, that's just picking up.","But again, these are mandated with a particular time, so if they don't get them done during their normal scheduled maintenance, then they effectively have to take the airplanes down to do the mods. And unfortunately, we do see a lot of people wait till the very end and a flurry of activity at the very end before the mandate effectivity date hits.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Noah.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry, I was on mute. I wanted to ask you about commercial margins on a pre R&D basis. I guess \u2013 I think you've cited mix as the key driver of the year-to-date compression. And I guess you've pointed to that being business jet driven, and I guess also the customer funded development sales. But could you talk about how much different the business jet margins are versus the rest of original equipment and versus aftermarket in the Commercial business?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No, I think what we're trying to describe in terms of the year-over-year headwind on margins due to the mix is the biz jet OE compared to customer-funded NRE. So what we're really thinking about it, we're staying flat, but we're trading some pretty high margin biz jet OE for low to no margin customer-funded engineering. That's the big mix change.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Now, as it relates to biz jet OE compared to the entire Commercial portfolio, I'd tell you it's among the more profitable businesses we have. I think it's probably \u2013 we've always said biz jet margins are higher than air transport margins. Aftermarket tends to be a little bit higher than OE, but I think the biz jet OE tends to be a pretty good margin product for us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, business jet OE is higher than aftermarket on average?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I'd say biz jet is probably on par with it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And what's your sense for your...","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I just want to clarify. The real impact though is the fact that we've got low to no margin customer-funded NREs coming in to the portfolio.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So what's the net mix impact 2017 versus 2016 pre-R&D?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, the net mix impact should actually \u2013 pre-R&D should be good because I think we're going to see customer funded NRE coming down, and we'll see some product sales coming up. So, the pre-R&D impact is going to be good. The issue then is, okay, what happens with customer funded \u2013 or company funded R&D, and Kelly has already referred to it. That may tick up. Pre-R&D margin should benefit from mix.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. I just wanted to follow up some on the cash flow, Patrick. I mean, receivables year-to-date are up $160 million, net in towards up $160 million, and customer advances down $100 million. And you mentioned that you're waiting for a Boeing payment. I don't know whether you would quantify how much that is and whether that's related to some contract you haven't signed with them yet or what it was. But the bottom line to me when you add all this together, you need like over $500 million cash flow in the fourth quarter to get to the low end of your guidance, and I'm just trying to put some pieces together as to how you might get there.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think you've touched on a few of them anyway, George. As it relates to Boeing, yeah, we've got probably between $30 million to $40 million of receivables that we are awaiting collection on Boeing. And it's not really a contractual issue, it's just they haven't paid us. So, that's out there. We do need to collect that. We have a very large ramp on the Government Systems revenue side. So, you said, receivables have spiked up, they absolutely have. Getting those billed and collected, the ones that exist as of June 30 is important, and also, the ramp into the fourth quarter and getting that ramp accomplished early, billed and collected, I think those are the sort of the keys to getting to that cash flow number. We've always had a backend loaded cash flow, but kind of like the Government Systems sales this year, it's even more backend loaded than it has been in the past.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah. No, that's very observant. And I mean, you always had a strong cash flow, Q4, just much stronger this year.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Yeah. And I think you've touched on a number of the key drivers to getting that cash flow in the fourth quarter.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, again.","Operator","The next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Kelly, I got a question on commercial rotorcraft? Can you size that for us and maybe give us some color on, I'm just guessing, it's probably down double-digits this year in Government just given the market, and I'm wondering if you see that being another headwind into 2017.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, so, again, the commercial rotorcraft is booked in our Government portfolio. And it's not all of the commercial rotorcraft that we're seeing being impaired right now. It's the aircraft that are supporting the oil and gas component of the market. Pat, do you have...","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Well, what we typically say, it's about 15% of our portfolio in Government Systems is helicopters, about a third of that is commercial helicopters. And as Kelly mentioned, some of that's civil kind of paramilitary helos, some of it's oil and gas, probably about half and half maybe. So it gives you a size as to what the impact of the oil and gas piece is.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And just one last follow-up. On your strategy to be more service oriented in terms of the non-aviation businesses at IMS, could you give us some color there maybe in terms of how far along you are with that and how much traction you can get there do you think?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Probably the first area that we're making progress in that is in the rail business, where we're providing positive train control software as a service. We've got that now into the market and we're starting to transition. This isn't going to be a switch to where one day, we just flip over and that we move from project to subscription revenue. But I think in both the airport business and the rail security business, we'll be able to move to more subscription based over the next several years. I think you ought to continue to view this though as it's project based, at least in the near term, it's going to be project based, and tend to be a little bit more lumpy in terms of overall timing.","But I am pleased some of our investment strategies that we've put in place, particularly in the airports area, have started to bear fruit. We've got growth this quarter. I'm expecting that we'll grow again that segment of the business in the next quarter. So, I think we've got some good plans to get the trajectory of that. So, it's not offsetting the good growth that we've consistently seen in the core aviation. Also, remember that it is less profitable than the core aviation component of the business. So, I don't think we're going to see significant changes in the overall profitability of that segment. The incremental margin performance really comes out of the core aviation growth.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the follow-up. In your investor marketing deck, the range of R&D has gone to 16% to 18% of sales, and back at the Analyst, or the Investor Day back in 2014, you rolled out a 18% to 20%. Looks like this year, you'll be above that 16% to 18% range; next year, I think you might be below that range. Can you talk about why that range moved and kind of what's the sustainable rates at a company level for R&D?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I still think the, yeah, I still think the 16% to 18% is a reasonable long-term range. I think we are going to be a little bit above that range this year. I think I'd characterize a couple of different things. One is the deferred balance is still very high. We'll see that come down. We'll see company-funded and customer-funded maybe change over time, but I think the big thing that's going to drive that down back into the range of 16% to 18% is the reduction in the deferred.","Now, why did the range change? Big change for us was adding the sales of IMS. And if you look at the IMS portfolio, we really don't have much in the way of R&D at all. The investments in IMS tend to be capitalized software mostly. So, that does more capital expenditures. So that's hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. So I do feel longer term comfortable with that 16% to 18% range, and I think it will come as the deferred winds down.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And, Patrick, the amortization pre-production next year, is it still about a $30 million headwind? Is that what it will say in the Q when it comes out?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that's about right, yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right, it hasn't changed much.","Operator","The next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Patrick. The earlier contract of company-funded R&D in 2017 looks more like 2015 than 2016. Is that a Commercial comment or a Government comment or a total comment?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'd call it total comment.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, is that sort of Commercial up, Government down?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think Government, I'd say Government, Commercial up, Government probably flattish.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. The reason I'm asking is just that construct \u2013 I mean, the Commercial side of company-funded R&D year-to-date is down 30%. So I guess it depends where the fourth quarter shakes out, but that construct would imply a pretty significant increase in the Commercial side in 2017 versus your comment earlier that it would tick up.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would say, yeah, I would expect an increase. Now again, Noah, I want to make it clear, we're still in the teeth of our annual operating plan cycle, and that involves a lot of discussions around investments and a lot of tradeoffs, and those have not been completed yet. But do I expect an increase in customer-funded? I absolutely do. I would hesitate to quantify it right now just because we're so early in the planning process.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And fundamentally, Noah, I think you got to remember that we did not defer the development of the 777X, we're spending that. So, we're just in the preliminary design phase here, mid this year, and now we'll ramp up, and next year will be a peak spending year for us in 777. So, if we aren't deferring these and we're expensing these, you will see a little bit more quarter-to-quarter dynamics as we're managing through the development of the programs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That helps clarify. And then one other follow-up. On the Boeing delinquency, how abnormal versus history is that, and what levers do you have to pull to get paid?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","That's abnormal to history. They've normally been paid good. I hope it's just a blip. Our avenues are to work our strong relationship with them and get that resolved, and we're in the process of doing that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Kelly, can you talk about the ability for you to do some additional restructuring to offset what looks like a more challenging than expected biz jet OE side? And then, Patrick, one follow-up. Based on the change in guidance, was there any adjustment to your comp accrual for the year? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, as far as restructuring, we're always looking to size the business to the end market demand. So if the end market is less, then there's all sorts of things that we can do to either shift resources to where we've got growth or to consolidate activities, and that's a part of our planning process as we're in the middle of that right now. I think particularly around the manufacturing, if we're not going to be delivering as much in business aviation, we're going to have to really take a hard look at our overall cost structure around that, especially if we don't see signs that this is temporary. If this is a long-term phenomenon, which right now it looks like, I think we've got to make sure we've got the overall cost base pretty well sized. I think you can look from historically, we're pretty aggressive in that regard. We'll take all the action we need to make sure we stay lean and mean in spite of challenging market conditions.","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And as it relates to the comp accrual, the biggest dynamic over the course of the year has been cash flow. If you remember, we raised it $50 million when we got the R&D cash credit; now, we're lowering it $50 million. So it went up to a little bit over 100%, and now, it's down closer to right around 100% for the year. Now, as we look at it quarter-over-quarter, it was not a big driver. I think it may have been $1 million or $2 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the follow-up. Just a quick one back on biz jets. Are you actively bidding on any new platforms? And secondly, are you aware of the \u2013 whether there are any new competitors in this space or new entrants in the biz jet avionics in particular?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, I'm not familiar with any \u2013 what I'll say new major competitors in the biz jet avionics. There is always a number of competitors that we deal with, and they have relative strengths and weaknesses just like we do. What was the first part of your question, I'm sorry?","Patrick E. Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Any new pursuits.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just what are you setting on any new platforms?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I really can't comment on that. Normally, if there's new platforms, we usually sign a non-disclosure agreement with the OEM so that they're not disclosed. Sorry. All right. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. The final question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just a final follow-up on, I think, Kelly, you mentioned initial provisioning on commercial transports maybe have been a bit of a headwind. Specifically, are your A350 provisioning in general, is it running the whole plan? And if so, is that due to just the slowness in deliveries from Airbus on that program or are you seeing anything else structurally that's causing you more concern on initial provisioning?","Kelly Ortberg - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, we are seeing pretty well, our planned initial provisioning at Airbus, and I don't see any delays in initial provisioning associated with the current ramp-up challenges. Most of the provisioning that we have there, well, it's not as large as 787 provisioning because we don't have the flight deck, and I think we've been pretty transparent. Also, a lot of the initial aircraft are going to fewer numbers of airlines, which is driving the provisioning plan, but I would say we're pretty well tracking on A350 to what we originally expected.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan D.

For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan D. Miller","Thank you, Chris, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being Webcast and you can view the slides we'll be presenting today at our Web-site at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and Webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking.

These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning everyone. With two quarters down, our fiscal year 2016 is progressing directionally as we expected. As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first half\/second half story. And because we saw it coming, we've been very transparent about the business aviation production rates as well as the Government Systems program timing and the impact on our top line sales profile for the year.","We also, as you know, initiated a restructuring program to help sustain our bottom line performance. This restructuring was essentially complete in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's now delivering the savings that we expected.","Now, the largest shift in growth from the first half to the second half of the year is in our Government Systems business, so let me start here and give you an update on the metrics I outlined last quarter relative to that growth. In the last call, I said that about 60% of the back half growth was already in backlog or coming from annual buys of follow-on business. This category has now grown from 60% last quarter to 77% at the end of the second quarter. Again, this is all funded activity. So I don't see much risk here and I'm pleased that we're making the progress in firming this up.","Now, the second category of growth is in programs that we have won but have yet to be awarded, and this has decreased from 25% last quarter to 17% this quarter. The only risk in this area is moving these programs through the contracting action into firm backlog, and at this point I don't see anything that would keep us from firming up this 17%.","And then the third category, which is the balance of the second half growth, is coming from programs that we have yet to go out and win. This category has decreased from 15% last quarter to now making up only 6% of our planned growth.","As I look at all these metrics, we're right in line with our historical anticipated sales for this time of the year. So despite the challenging first half, we have good line of sight to the second-half growth for Government Systems. And as a reminder, the fourth quarter is always the biggest in terms of sales and margins and I do expect our growth rate to be the highest in the fourth quarter as well.","Now, turning to Commercial Systems, the first half went about as expected but the aftermarket components are a little different from what we originally anticipated. The business aviation has performed better than expected and the air transport aftermarket has been softer. As this turned out, the two have essentially offset each other for the first half of the year, so our overall aftermarket performance remains on track.","The strength in the business aviation aftermarket has been driven by mandates, which we expected, but also by stronger-than-expected cockpit retrofits. We introduced some new avionics aftermarket products late last year and they are selling quite well.","The weaker air transport aftermarket is being driven by the impacts of recycling, and we're also dealing with the impacts of more aggregators in the service market. I believe these are indicative of structural changes in how the airlines are managing their MRO needs and we should no longer be expecting MRO to grow at traffic rates, at least for the foreseeable future.","Now, air transport OEM rates are progressing as planned with production ramping for the 787, the A350, and the Airbus narrow-bodies. These increases are partially offset by rate reductions on the A330.","Now, business jet OEM rates remain consistent with last quarter, and if you recall I said in the last call that the summer shutdown period is when we would likely see business jet reductions if there are going to be any more that happened this year. So that remains a watch area for us for the next quarter.","Finally, let me turn to our Information Management Services business. This past quarter we delivered 5% sales growth and really strong operating performance with margins improving by 370 basis points. Our core aviation business grew 8% for the quarter, driving the profitability for that business.","While this was great performance, our top line to date is a bit lower than I expected. We are seeing weaker demand for business aviation international trip support which has been hit pretty hard in Russia, China, and in oil-producing countries.","Without a pickup here, we'll probably see our IMS business grow a bit slower for the full year than originally expected. We are expecting though to see growth in the second half from the non-aviation portion of the business and I do want to point out that the better-than-expected profitability should more than offset any top line weakness in our IMS portfolio for the year.","So having walked through the three business segments, let me now turn to our longer-term outlook. We achieved several very important milestones on programs that drive our long-term growth. These include the first flight of the Boeing 737 MAX with our new standard equipment, all delivered on time and working very well. The first refueling flight was performed on the KC-46 tanker, validating both our avionics and the refueling mission package which is a first using 3-D image technology.","And we were also selected as one of the suppliers on the U.S. Army's Manpack radio program, which is a key step towards bringing this large growth opportunity to reality. Also in March, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as one of 2016's most ethical companies, and this is the seventh year in a row receiving this award.","So these achievements all demonstrate how we're striving to be the most trusted source of aviation and high integrity solutions in the world, and it's really some good reasons to be optimistic about the future of our Company.","Now, before I turn it over to Patrick, I do want to address an administrative item. For years, we've issued our next fiscal year financial guidance in September and I've received feedback from many of you that it would make a lot more sense for us to issue the guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results, which typically happens at the end of October.","So this is exactly what we plan to do for this coming year. Hopefully, this will make things more efficient for the investment community as well as for Rockwell Collins and it will allow us to better align with the OEMs, our production rates, and we'll be able to discuss year on year financial guidance because our full-year results for fiscal 2016 will be complete at that time.","So with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details.","Patrick Allen","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total Company second quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations, and shares outstanding.","Total Company sales for the quarter decreased $30 million or 2%, compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations increased $9 million or 6% and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.08 or 7% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense due to the permanent extension of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit.","As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $611 million in the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $17 million or 5% to $353 million, primarily due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, unfavourable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus A330 production rates, all partially offset by higher customer-funded development program sales, higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 production rate ramps and higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service later this year.","Aftermarket sales increased $14 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher business jet avionics retrofit mandate sales and higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of the International Communications Group.","Commercial Systems operating earnings decreased $7 million with operating margins declining 80 basis points from 22.9% to 22.1%. Operating earnings and margins decreased from the prior year primarily due to sales mix as lower margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased. In addition, SG&A cost increased from higher cost associated with recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by lower Company-funded research and development expense and cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.","Moving now to Slide 5, Government Systems overall revenue decreased by 5% to $538 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, lower sales from simulation and training programs, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international targeting system deliveries.","Government Systems second quarter operating earnings decreased $6 million to $108 million, resulting in an operating margin that was flat with the second quarter of the prior year at 20.1%. The decreased operating earnings resulted from a lower sales volume, partially offset by lower Company-funded research and development expense and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.","Turning to Slide 6, Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year, as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 8%, while the non-aviation-related businesses were slightly down compared to last year.","Information Management Services second quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.9%, compared to 14.2% in the second quarter of the last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to incremental earnings on the higher sales volume as well as a favorable resolution of some certain prior year claims associated with international business jet support services.","Looking next to Slide 7, we show year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $45 million of operating cash flow compared to $132 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted from the lower pre-tax earnings and net unfavorable changes to working capital which were primarily due to the timing of sales related to advance payments from customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.","Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $489 million in the first six months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first six months of FY 2016. Company-funded R&D decreased $43 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower software-defined radio development cost in Government Systems.","Customer-funded research and development expense increased $15 million due to higher development costs for regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Pre-production engineering investment, net, increased due to higher costs incurred for a military program in Government Systems.","Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first six months of FY 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1x from 1.7x at year end. The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial paper, as the first half of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect this level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at an average cost of $85.03. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $192 million.","Now on to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. We do now have some clarity on when we expect to benefit from the tax planning strategies that we initially guided would benefit the second half of fiscal '16. These tax planning strategies which entail utilizing capital loss carryforwards from prior years is now expected to benefit our third fiscal quarter.","Our tax rate for the third quarter will likely be in the mid-teens and the tax rate for the fourth quarter will likely be in the neighborhood of about 30%. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23%.","I also wanted to talk about the trajectory of our operating margins over the last half of the year. I'm expecting operating margins to be about flat sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. We do expect the overall business will return to growth in the third quarter and that growth will drive incremental earnings. But we will also be shifting our engineering spend from deferred engineering to Company-funded engineering, resulting in a fairly flat sequential total operating margins.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we should expect to see more incremental margin growth due to the higher growth rate in sales that Kelly talked about a little earlier.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections, so Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan D. Miller","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we'll answer those additional questions as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard A. Rubel","Kelly, you talked a little bit about bizjet aftermarket and some of the positives and also some of the concerns or change in dynamics in commercial. Specifically with bizjets, can you talk about whether it was categories and what kind of visibility you might have, and then also the same for the commercial market?","Kelly Ortberg","If you look at those two, the commercial and bizjet aftermarket, I recognize this is kind of counter-intuitive to the health of those underlying markets, but in business aviation, we\u2019ve continued to see very strong mandate growth this quarter, which we did expect as I said in the opening remarks, but we also introduced some fans upgrades, avionics upgrades into the market, and again that is selling very well and I'm hopeful that that will continue to sell and maybe give us some upside opportunity here in the balance of the year.","In air transport, it's kind of the opposite story. We had mandate headwinds in air transport. Last year, we had a big engine sale which didn't repeat. So we had a little bit of a comparable issue on that. If I strip all of the one-time activities as well as our Intertrade used business sales out of air transport and just look at the fundamental MRO, we've been roughly flat the first two quarters in fundamental MRO, and I think that's about what we're going to see there, flat to very low-single-digit growth in that underlying MRO business as we deal with the new recycling phenomenon that's here to stay.","Howard A. Rubel","And then just as one follow-up, a little bit different, you talked about LRSB and you had some other military wins. Is there a change in focus and can you add anything with respect to the LRSB opportunity?","Kelly Ortberg","No, I can't add anything on that other than we're pleased to be on the Northrop Grumman team. That's about all I can say there. I wouldn't say, Howard, there's a change in our focus. I just think it's a change in the opportunities. The market dynamics are getting better. We're certainly seeing lift in things like JDAM production rates associated with what's going on in the world. We are still struggling with the timing of getting things through the contracting action. That didn't improved. And as you look at our Government business for the first half of the year, we guided that at down mid-single-digit, we ended up at 8% down. So we are a little behind where we wanted to be, and it's mostly getting some of these selected programs through the contracting action, a few for military sale specific programs, but we've got good visibility to that. I'm pretty confident we'll be able to get that done by the end of the fiscal year.","Operator","The next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles A. Walton","I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the business jet OEM business, regional jet OEM end market, and the declines there you saw were I guess inclusive of some offset from growth in the CSeries, so as you look at those and you kind of bifurcate them, could you talk about is the business regional, I know you have gone through your contingency as it relates to business jets, but are you now below that contingency given the current run rate, and also what's the level of CSeries growth you're actually experiencing?","Kelly Ortberg","I think I said this in the last quarter, we used up our contingency and a little more as everybody trued up their production rates at the beginning of the calendar year, and I would say that was kind of across the board. We saw little bit additional reduction in Globals from what we originally planned. So I haven't seen any changes since then, Myles. We just cut in our Fusion flight deck on the King Air if you recall and I think we're getting pretty good vibes from Cessna in the end market that just got certified in Europe, so we're hopeful that that will continue to do what it needs to do to sustain rates there. And we'll watch the furlough summer timeframe, as I talked about. That's where we get any kind of tweaking of rates. Now, recognize that if they do change the rates, that's pretty late in our fiscal year. So I'm not anticipating a heck of a lot of movement here yet, but I think there's still a little bit of risk of adjustments here with the summer timeframe.","Myles A. Walton","And is the CSeries growing sequentially or is it growth rate year on year that's helping that end market a little bit in terms of comps year-on-year?","Kelly Ortberg","The CSeries is growing both sequentially and year-over-year fairly substantially. The issue there is the business jet market for us is so much larger than the regional market.","Myles A. Walton","Okay. And then the other one, Patrick, on R&D, I guess I'm stripping out everything or trying to strip everything inclusive of R&D and all the other adjustments, and the underlying margin at Commercial, it just seems pretty low, and I understand the mix on drivers of it, so maybe the question is really about the run rate of IRAD, obviously lowest I've seen in a long time in the quarter, and it sounds like you swapped back from customer funded to Company funded, can you give us some sense year on year will R&D be about flat for Company-funded R&D or is it going to be down?","Patrick Allen","Within Commercial Systems, it's going to be down year-over-year in total, but we will see that transition in the back half of the year. And I'd say back half of the year, 2016 to 2015, it's going to be about flat from an R&D perspective. One thing I wanted to make sure that we're all focused on though is a fair chunk of our savings from the restructuring program is manifesting itself through the research and development expense line because a fair number of the people who took the voluntary retirement program were engineers.","Operator","The next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein","Can you talk about do you still expect pre-production engineering to be up 100 million, and that only leaves about 26 million for the last two quarters? So I'm just saying, will we see growth in Q3 and then it turns a decrease in Q4? How does that play out for the year?","Patrick Allen","We're still forecasting deferred engineering to be in the neighborhood of 100 million. I think there's maybe a little bit of risk that it will tick slightly higher than that due largely to the two things. One is I'll say a decrease in the amortization associated with the timing of some programs in the Government Systems side, but the bigger piece is accelerated spend on the 737 MAX program as we continue to get closer to entering the service there.","Samuel J. Pearlstein","So we'll grow in both the remaining quarters?","Patrick Allen","Yes.","Samuel J. Pearlstein","There will be some contribution I guess. And then just last quarter you talked about 5 percentage point impact on the Government Systems for a supplier issue and the order timing. Were both of those resolved in the quarter and did you recover all those sales?","Kelly Ortberg","We recovered all of the product issue and we recovered that real quickly in the quarter. We did not recover the sales timing issue. In fact, it's one big FMS contract. We've received the contract now but we received it late enough that we didn't get the conversion of the sales. So that's still in our second half to go to catch up.","Samuel J. Pearlstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the commercial aftermarket in air transport and sort of we have talked in the past about the impact of retirement and some of the structural changes, but what's sort of the offset there from Intertrade first of all? Second of all, what was the contribution there from inorganic sales in the quarter from the acquisitions? And then third, just kind of more qualitatively, is there something, I mean this is an issue that has affected various companies in the aftermarket in a couple of different \u2013 at different time periods and for a couple of different ways, is there anything specific you see about your products that makes this kind of better or worse or longer lasting than elsewhere?","Kelly Ortberg","I think there's a couple of things that you have to watch. First of all, the retirement rate does impact the business. If there's fewer retirements, it's harder to find the used parts to turn. On the other hand, we continue to operate those platforms and drive MRO growth. For our portfolio, it's very wide-body driven. So if you look this year, the retirements have abated but most of that has been in the narrow-body. Some of the 75, 76 and 747-8 retirements are very high content aftermarket platforms for us. So if you want to look at that, I'd look more at the wide-body which may not be typical to other peer company portfolios.","What we said all along is the aftermarket MRO is going to be again pretty flat to very low single-digit. The offset to that is these part sales out of our Intertrade. That comes very lumpy. This past quarter we were down because we had an engine a year ago. We do have another engine sale in the back half of our fiscal year. So we have some things that are going to create a lumpy overall environment because it's really going to be driven more by our Intertrade sales than the underlying MRO.","Seth M. Seifman","Great. And then on the inorganic side, the contribution in the quarter?","Patrick Allen","It came mostly in the air transport aftermarket and it was about 3% or 4% of growth in the \u2013 so it offset let's say 3% to 4% decline in the air transport aftermarket.","Kelly Ortberg","The only thing I do want to add, Seth, is remember, we knew mandates were coming down, so we did see again mandates comparable on the engineering sale as headwinds for the quarter in air transport. That mandate headwind is really related to TCAS changes. The next uptick in mandates we'll start getting will be the ADS-B. We are starting to book some ADS-B orders out to 2020 mandate, probably will drive some increases more in the 2017 and probably peak in the 2018-2019 timeframe.","Seth M. Seifman","Okay, thanks. And I guess maybe since we're talking about the topic, would it be in the first half of your fiscal 2017 that we'd see provisioning for the MAX start to pick up?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, I think a material provisioning, that's when you'll start to see a pickup. We may actually see a little bit of provisioning with the initial customer here by the end of the year. We're working that right now.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment","Kelly, could you give us a little more color on what you're seeing on the A350, kind of the run rates? You've historically, Rockwell has always been kind of ahead of the OEMs in terms of the run rates. What are you seeing in that program right now?","Kelly Ortberg","For this year, we're still fully aligned with Airbus. I think we have 30 airplanes in the year. That's up almost double from last year. So I think we're pretty well aligned with what Airbus is delivering. I think the thing we got to watch is their delivery rate and continued production ramp-up. I'm not anticipating any change for this year. Actually let me correct that, I said that wrong. 30 deliveries last year, it's 60 this year. I'm a year behind.","Peter J. Arment","If I could ask, just to sneak in one follow-up, just unrelated but Kelly you mentioned kind of, you gave us a lot of color on the Government Systems line of sight of growth for the back half of the year. What are you seeing from an international defense perspective? Are you seeing any change in like the pacing of awards just given the reset in the oil price deck, are you seeing any impact there?","Kelly Ortberg","No, not really, nothing out of the Middle East and everything continues to track pretty much to plan. Where we're seeing delays is actually getting through the foreign military sale process, which is really a U.S. issue and less the end customer issue in getting through that contracting action.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky","Just wanted to go back really quickly on the aftermarket for both bizjet and air transport. On the bizjet side, can you talk a little bit about the retrofit work that you're seeing? It suggests it's being spurred by new products that you've come out with, but are you seeing retrofits across the entire cabins of these aircraft or just for the parts of these new products that you've come up with?","And then on the air transport side, maybe give us your initial thoughts on the initial steering activity with regard to the MAX, is the MAX going to be less robust from the initial steering perspective than we would see given all new aircraft? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether initial steering on the MAX would be anything like what we saw with the 87?","Kelly Ortberg","It won't per airplane be anything like the 87. First of all the amount of equipment on a narrow-body versus a wide-body is much less, but the number of aircraft is much higher. So we do expect a meaningful provisioning. And I think that's product line specific. Remember we don't have the display system on the next-generation, the NGs. We do have that. That's where the display system will be a big part of what the new provisioning. If they are using a common VHF radio to an existing fleet, then we won't see provisioning for that. So I think it is going to be very product specific to what's changed between NG and a MAX, but for us that's a lot and it's pretty attractive for the provisioning. The first part of your question I'm sorry was\u2026","Patrick Allen","Business jet retrofits.","Kelly Ortberg","Business jet retrofits, we are continuing to see cabin retrofits that fuelled a lot of our growth last year. I think the cabin retrofits remain solid but aren't probably growing as much as they are last year. What we are seeing the growth driven by are these new fans updates to things like Falcon 50s, we've got a new Pro Line Fusion upgrade for King Air is out in the market and we're again seeing those sell. So we didn't have those products in the market last year. So it's hard for me to tell whether that's product driven or market driven, probably a little bit of both.","Operator","The next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro","I wanted to pursue the Commercial margin a little bit more. If I look at the Commercial margin ex-R&D, it went down like 500 basis points to 29.6% from 34.6%. Now clearly some of that is affected by the higher sales of the customer funded lower margin business, but if you can explain a little bit more what's going on there? And then also when you go to the third quarter, Patrick, it sounds like you're implying the R&D will be flat with Q3 of last year as opposed to declining 22 million like it did this quarter. So what changes to enable that margin to even stay close to what it is this quarter for Commercial?","Patrick Allen","George, I think you've hit on the biggest margin impact in Commercial Systems, that is the mix shift, and it was pretty significant. We've always said business jet OEM is very good margin for us and customer-funded R&D comes at little to no margin. So that was the biggest shift in margin for us.","Now, included in that is also a few million dollars associated with I'll call it acquisition related SG&A cost that the Commercial Systems is absorbing as well. So you've got a compounding effect of those acquisition related SG&A costs.","And as we progress further, we're going to see sequential growth in Commercial Systems. That growth is going to be coming from higher-margin product. And so we should see I'll say incremental earnings to offset that lift in Company funded R&D.","George D. Shapiro","Okay. And then just one quick other one. I'm assuming or guessing, Patrick, that the gain in the IMS business was maybe $3 million or $4 million.","Patrick Allen","I think it was around $3 million.","Operator","The next question is from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss","Kelly, I know it's a little bit early to think about 2017, but you've had this target out there for high single digit growth at Commercial Systems down the future. Based on everything you know today, given the pressure on business jets, we've had a 777 rate cut announced, do we get somewhere close to that or is that out of the question, just trying to think about maul in Commercial Systems on a go forward basis?","Kelly Ortberg","It is a little early to make that call. We're certainly seeing lower business aviation production rates than what we anticipated when we put that guidance out. But I'll also say there's been good stuff. We've seen increased rates in air transport. We've seen increased content on some new aircraft coming into the market. It looks like CSeries is now going to move from the development phase into the production phase. So I don't want to tell you what our rate is right now because I'm still waiting to see the final detail from my team, but there has been puts and takes and I think over the long run they should be able to balance each other out.","David E. Strauss","Okay. Patrick, a follow-up on working capital, you talked about it trending better in the second half of the year. Can you just give a little bit more detail there, what are you expecting, what we should see from advances and I guess production inventory? I think you've already touched on pre-production.","Patrick Allen","We did see a bit of a buildup in the production inventory, and I would say it was in anticipation of a strong second half for Government Systems in terms of sales. So this buildup in inventory, that was part of the working capital. I expect that to normalize over the course of the balance of the year. And I think the customer payment, the customer advances, I think we view it as being a headwind for the year, when we came into the year. I think it's probably going to abate a little bit in the second half but not a lot. I think the improvement you're going to see in working capital is going to be largely the production inventory.","Now, if I was to point to a risk to our cash flow, it is the fact that we are so backend loaded on sales that making sure that we get the sales booked and cash collected by the end of the fourth quarter is going to be the challenge that we're all focused on.","Operator","The next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein","Big picture question for you, Kelly. One of the themes that seemed to emerge at Homburg this year, even more so than previous years, was the connected airplane and so on and so forth. Can you just wax a little bit on that opportunity for Collins when you think about high-bandwidth connectivity to the airplane and how ARINC is positioned for that, because it seems like they are positioned pretty well but I just wanted to get your take on it?","Kelly Ortberg","We are positioned well and we are \u2013 I mean we are seeing growth in the connectivity today. We've booked our first four customers, two in business aviation and two in the air transport market, for Global Xpress which is the new broadband Inmarsat capability and we are working a lot of proposals now. We do see this as a big growth opportunity. And recognize Ron that today we really don't provide much cabin-based broadband connectivity in the market. So that's all growth opportunity for us.","We're very strong in the flight deck connectivity but less so in the cabin and GX will present a big opportunity for us, and we're also working with OneWeb for a next-generation broadband capability where we're the exclusive supplier of the radio equipment and also a value-added reseller and we're going to be bringing that onto the Airbus platforms in the future.","So I'm excited about it. It's happening. There is no question there's going to be strong demand for broadband and connectivity. The connectivity solutions that are out there today that aren't broadband just aren't meeting the connected world needs that we all have. And once that happens, it opens the door to applications and services and we're also focused at providing those kinds of capabilities where once you have broadband connectivity, you can move information easier on and off the airplane and provide additional services for either maintenance or operation improvements for the airlines going forward.","So it's one of the drivers as to why we think the ARINC acquisition is a great value driver for the long term for our Company and I'm excited about the growth of our Information Management Services portfolio and the opportunities going forward.","Ronald J. Epstein","So maybe just one natural follow-on, if you can even speculate or maybe even know, what's the required investment kind of to grow in that area? I mean is it, how would you quantify that?","Kelly Ortberg","Look, I would put it in \u2013 let me just put it in categories. There's new radios, so you've got to develop a radio equipment that's compatible with these new broadband satellites. A lot of investment in antenna technology associated again with these new satellites and be an efficient integration. There is new certification cost both in forward fit as well as retrofit, so we have to go get STCs. So for example for these four launch customers that I've talked about, we are investing now in getting the STCs done, getting the certification baseline to retrofit those aircrafts. So those are the categories of investment and they are very similar to what investments we do with other radio systems in the market. So I think we know what those investments are and they are plunged in our R&D plans as we look forward.","Operator","The next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","So to follow up to George's question, the biggest decline I think I've ever seen in your margin before are into Company funded R&D and deferred engineering amortization. To what extent was that also impacted by the fact that it sounds like most of your Commercial revenue gain came in new program, 787, A350, CSeries, is that lower margin business? And then as you look at the second half, I mean you're going to have higher deferred engineering amortization, higher Company funded R&D, kind of looks to me like the mix continues to shift toward those newer programs. Can the Commercial margins improve over this 21%?","Patrick Allen","I think what I'll say is I think Commercial Systems margin in the back half of the year is going to be pretty close to what it was for the first half of the year. I don't see it changing significantly, Cai. Now I do want to I guess clarify a couple of points. The margin headwind that we had from this mix shift was significant and we're talking about going from very high margin product sales to lower margin customer funded R&D, and that was a big impact, and I think going forward we'll still see some of that mix issue but it won't be quite as dramatic and I think we feel pretty comfortable with the margin targets that we've laid out for Commercial Systems are achievable.","Kelly Ortberg","Just to add to that, Cai, the margin mix issue is what Patrick said, it's losing the bizjet revenue and increasing the RE or engineering revenues, it's not a mix of new products coming to the market. We have very good profitability with the new products coming into market. It's part of our common product line strategy where we're reusing. So you shouldn't view 787 anymore as a new product. We've been in rate manufacturing for that, we're now at 12 month rate. So that's very, very good performance from us and I'm not worried about new product versus old product mix looking forward.","Cai von Rumohr","Right, but if the Company R&D is flat year-over-year, deferred engineering is going to be up, you've got to be up 200 to 300 basis points in your margin before those items in Commercial just to hold relatively flat. So what happens in the second half to kind of give you that margin lift pre those expense items that you're talking about versus the second quarter?","Patrick Allen","First of all, I didn't say that the Company-funded R&D is going to be flat. It's going to be down a little bit. It will be closer to flat for the third quarter. So that's part of the answer. And then the other answer is continued cost reductions, we're continuing to see benefit from the retirement program flowing through the numbers. If you think about it from an operations perspective, that benefit gets deferred by a quarter because it's an inventory. So we'll see that benefit flow through as well.","Operator","The next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak","Patrick, maybe just sort of hopefully round that out on the margins, you also mentioned I think looking for a sequentially roughly flat total segment margin. Maybe if you could just talk about that by segment and even if you discussed the progression through the end of the year by segment just given there are a bunch of moving pieces in the Commercial segment, sounds like you gained 200 basis points or so at IMS which I would assume doesn't repeat and the Government growth rate changes a lot, so maybe it would be helpful to just discuss it by segment?","Patrick Allen","I think what you're going to see, you're right, the IMS segment margins were higher than they normally would be. So I think what you'll see is the IMS I'll say more normalizing in that 15% to 16% range. I think Commercial Systems as I mentioned is going to be pretty flat quarter to quarter Q3 and Q4. And what you'll see in Government Systems is that the margin is going to maybe tick up a little bit in the third quarter, not much, and the bulk of the margin expansion is going to be in the fourth quarter.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Sorry, did you say Commercial flat 3Q and then flat again 4Q?","Patrick Allen","Yes, pretty much.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And how 4Q loaded is the free cash outlook just given the year-to-date number there and what you said about the collection risks?","Patrick Allen","Unfortunately every year it seems like our cash flow is fourth quarter loaded and it continues to be, and I'd say, if anything, probably a little bit more, little heavier than normal just because of the sales profile we're looking at. So, yes, very heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard T. Safran","I'll just switch topics here. I was interested in this HMS Manpack contract. Can you tell me, it's bit of a multipart question, when you deliver the 30 radios, if [forward] [ph] production is supposed to commence in 2017, does that imply a down select this year? And to the best you can, if you could discuss your view of the competition and how much of an incremental impact this program could have this fiscal year assuming a win? And is this a winner take all type of thing, meaning if you did win, would the $12.7 billion over 10 years all go to Collins?","Kelly Ortberg","Okay, a lot of questions there, so let me kind of walk through the program. First of all, we've won the initial award with two other suppliers. We'll be delivering roughly 30 radios I think into the Army. They'll take those through two test regimes, a development test regime and a contract test regime, to validate those radios against the overall requirement. So there will be no revenues in fiscal 2016 associated with that program because these are free of charge radios, we're just providing them to the Army to go through the test.","From the results of the test, then they will go to what I would call a call for improvement for the participants who pass the test to then providing an updated price for the next fiscal year buy. So I would say, Richard, it will probably be this time next year before they make that decision. Their current plan is that they would down-select from three \u2013 if there are still three viable suppliers through the test phase, they would down select from three to two for that annual buy. Obviously at this time next year, there's actually very little revenue opportunity next year either because the revenue will go when the radios are delivered. So it really has moved to an 2018, really an 2018 growth item.","The other thing I'll say is that $12.7 billion, while I like the top line numbers, what that is, is that's the max quantities in every case under the IDIQ contract. So think of this contract as a huge matrix with max quantities all priced and they are all added together. This is not going to be a $12.7 billion contract in my mind. However, it will be very significant, maybe more like $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue. How much comes to us depends on how many contractors, what percentage that we win. We said, look, we can easily see $100 million a year kind of revenue stream from this program, if not more.","Richard T. Safran","Okay, that helps. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Just couple of clarifications. On the aftermarket numbers, just if we talk organically here, it looks like organically it was sort of down high single digits in air transport. That was Intertrade down, MRO flat and I guess your sort of regular spares and [indiscernible] use up. Is that correct?","Kelly Ortberg","No. In air transport, it was Intertrade down because\u2026","Carter Copeland","Intertrade down on the engine sale.","Kelly Ortberg","Right. Mandates down, you didn't say mandates, pretty substantial headwind in mandates, MRO roughly flat and Intertrade down.","Carter Copeland","Can you give us a sense of just roughly how big MRO and Intertrade are in the whole mix? And I know Intertrade has been growing a lot.","Patrick Allen","Yes, we've said Intertrade is I'd say between $100 million and $150 million sales a year. Most of that is in the air transport market.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And then just quickly another clarification, on the mix impact that you mentioned, Patrick, should we think about as primarily Globals or was there a good chunk of that that was BFE on things like the A330?","Patrick Allen","There was a little bit of both but I'd say primarily Global.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Patrick, on the margins again, on the second half ramp, if I'm understanding this correctly, Commercial is not kind of consistent with the first half and that most of the ramp is at Government, is that what you're saying?","Patrick Allen","That's correct, yes.","Robert Spingarn","And most of that\u2026","Patrick Allen","I'm sorry, most of that is in the fourth quarter, yes.","Robert Spingarn","And most of that is in the fourth quarter. But it looks like it's fairly substantial when baked into your guidance here. In other words, could you be a little more specific with how the Government segment margin trends here from a ramp perspective?","Patrick Allen","I guess I think it's going to be relatively flat from second quarter to the third quarter, then we're going to see a large significant increase in the fourth quarter. That's driven just by the sales volume. The fourth quarter is always the highest sales volume for Government Systems and it's going to be especially so this year. And a lot of those sales are these international programs that Kelly referred to earlier and those international programs are kind of very, very good margins relative to the average Government Systems margin.","Robert Spingarn","Could we be talking about a few hundred basis points?","Patrick Allen","Yes. In terms of third quarter to fourth quarter expansion, yes.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then, Kelly, just quickly on bizjet OE, you've talked about some weakness there, we've been seeing it everywhere all along, little bit disappointing relative to expectations. I'm thinking the Challenger numbers may be a little bit high, at a 100 a year, I think they may even have gone down quietly on the last guidance out of Bombardier though they didn't quantify the number. Are you prepared for lower Challengers?","Kelly Ortberg","I think we're pretty aligned with what the market demand is for Challengers going forward.","Robert Spingarn","How does that differ from what the Bombardier plan is?","Kelly Ortberg","When we deliver the airplanes versus when they are delivering. I'm going to let them comment on that.","Robert Spingarn","They've already guided down without essentially specifying a number, and I just wanted what's baked into your number.","Kelly Ortberg","Again, I'm not going to get ahead of Bombardier here. I think we're pretty well aligned with again what we expect the market to be on those. I don't want to project Bombardier's\u2026","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Let me ask you the question a little differently. What do you see the downside risk as in your bizjet OE for this year, do you feel like there's some risk there?","Kelly Ortberg","Again, I think it's the furlough time. I'm certainly watching what's going on at Gulfstream. That would probably be the area I would highlight.","Robert Spingarn","Right, and you think that couldn't impact some of your product lines [indiscernible]?","Kelly Ortberg","We don't have a lot of content on the Gulfstream programs. The G650 is a good content aircraft for us. So, again, we'll just watch what they do there. I think we're pretty well aligned at Bombardier.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Stallard with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Kelly, thanks for all the detail on Government Systems and [indiscernible] the backlog and the pipeline you have for the second half. I was wondering how much of this work is sustainable into fiscal 2017.","Kelly Ortberg","That's a program specific question. Most of that work is sustainable into 2016. I'd say very little of it is orders that we can completely convert to sales throughout the year. So think of even the product sales where we get orders for ARC-210 or our MIDS product line, we'll make some sales this year but we won't sell all that backlog out next year. So while this is a second half loaded year, it also gives us opportunity for next year as well as long as we book these orders.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then Patrick, just on the tax situation, you've got these one-off gains in fiscal 2016. What should we think of as sort of the run rate for tax going forward into next year and beyond?","Patrick Allen","I'd target probably around 30%. We've always been trying to beat that goal but with the R&D tax credit I'm thinking around 30%.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Kenneth Herbert","Just two clarification questions on the Government Systems. I mean it sounds like with the margin commentary that the sales volume flattish in the third quarter perhaps, maybe down a little, maybe up a little, which implies a very significant fourth quarter on the top line, potentially up close to 20%, and I can appreciate the detail you provided on the backlog and confidence, but are there a couple of programs you'd highlight as swing factors and does that sort of cadence from the third to the fourth quarter make sense?","Patrick Allen","I would say, if I heard your question right, we're planning on having growth, year-over-year growth from Government Systems in the third quarter. Now it will be higher in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, but we're going to have growth both in the third and the fourth quarter. And the things that are going to drive the fourth quarter growth higher are again some of the international programs that we're in the process of closing out right now.","Kenneth Herbert","Okay, so expect some growth in the third quarter, so that's helpful. But then the mix obviously is what's driving the margin commentary it sounds like.","Patrick Allen","Yes, the mix, and I had mentioned also the transition to increased Company funded R&D and that's going to happen on the Government side as well.","Kenneth Herbert","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Kelly Ortberg","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The final question is from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael F. Ciarmoli","Kelly, maybe if we could just go back to Ron's line of questioning around the connected airplane, we obviously see some of these structural headwinds in the aftermarket. How are you guys positioning yourself with IMS to take advantage of some of the predictive maintenance or real-time monitoring and should we expect not near-term but over time that to be an aftermarket sort of growth engine as there is more of this monitoring of systems in flight and predictive maintenance?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, absolutely, and that will come to us in a couple of different ways. We'll provide \u2013 in cases we'll be providing services to the airlines, we're also working with engine OEMs where we're providing service to deliver the data to them, then they provide a service to the airline around the predictive maintenance. It depends on where the intellectual property resides. We'll be able to do that for the things that we have the intellectual property. We'll be a \u2013 think of us as a data delivery source to other companies who own the intellectual property going forward. So there's great opportunities. We'll be able to put apps in our aircraft and the ground, we'll be able to drive services and support that again to the OEMs, to the product OEMs, as well as the airlines.","Michael F. Ciarmoli","Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. That's all I have.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan D. Miller","Thank you. So we plan to file our Form 10-Q later today, so please review that document for additional disclosures, and thank you for joining us and participating on today's conference call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Sir, please go ahead.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Shawn and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide two of this webcast presentation and from time to time, in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks, Ryan and good morning, everyone. We are off to a great start to our fiscal year 2015 plan. After our strong fourth quarter last year, I am pleased to say that we have followed up with another great quarter of sales and earnings growth led by our Commercial Systems and Information Management Services businesses. And as we expected, we are seeing continued stabilization in our government systems revenues. We were also able to deliver some really strong margin performance in all of the businesses which I think demonstrates our ability to provide the incremental margin growth that's an important element of our plan.","Our first quarter results are very consistent with our outlook that we projected at our Investor Day, now almost a year ago. And if you recall, at that time I said that the priorities for increasing shareowner value would be accelerating our topline growth, expanding our free cash flow and deploying our capital to balance both growth and shareowner returns and we are doing that. This quarter, we delivered 16% topline growth as we again benefited from the acquisition of ARINC in addition to the organic growth. We delivered 20.6% operating margins with expansion across all of our businesses. And we delivered 29% earnings per share growth as a result of our strong performance aided by the retroactive R&D tax credit as well as share repurchases.","Now I would like to also highlight a few of the important program related milestones we hit during the quarter. As you all know, Airbus made the first delivery of its A350 which features the most Rockwell Collins content of any aircraft at Airbus. This starts the wind down of the very significant investment phase and we begin reaping the return on this investment, which we will enjoy for years to come. We also saw the first flight of the Boeing KC-46 tanker, which features significant content from Rockwell Collins, both from an avionics perspective as well as a mission systems perspective. This marks a major milestone in our strategy to bring commercial technology and products into the military market.","And then the much-anticipated new business highlights for the quarter was the finally announced wins on the 777X. This includes the standard large-format flight displays as well as optional dual head-up displays, the standard integrated surveillance system, which incorporates our weather radar, our traffic collision avoidance system or TCAS, our terrain awareness system or TAS and the transponder for the aircraft, all of which are selectable BFE on existing 777s and now will be sole-sourced to Rockwell Collins on the 777X. The integrated surveillance system also provides the onboard traffic computer for current and future ADS-B applications.","We were also selected for a number of flight control systems in addition to the previously announced integrated flight control electronics fly by wire system for the aircraft in partnership with BAE. These results represent a significant market share win for Rockwell Collins and all in, I expect the 777X will represent about $2 billion in sales for Rockwell Collins over the life of the program.","Now let we remind you that with this position, we now provide the common state-of-the-art flight deck technologies and products for all of Boeing's next-generation airplanes, including the 787, the 737 MAX, the KC-46 or 767 and now the 777X. So we feel really good about the continued growth in revenues that these positions should provide our company. ","And as I have been indicating all along, our plan is to fund the 777X development within our existing R&D expense budget. So we won't be further leveraging our balance sheet for this program, all very consistent with our improved cash flow plan.","Now looking beyond the quarter at the balance of fiscal 2015 with one quarter in the books and everything is looking good. So we are flowing the full R&D tax benefit into our full year earnings per share and cash flow guidance. Longer-term, I believe we are on path for our sustained growth, we are seeing the stabilization in defense, in business aviation and we are seeing anticipated growth in air transport and information management services. And fitting the 777X into our expensed R&D budget is an important indication of our serious focus on improving our cash flow performance without sacrificing long-term growth opportunities for the company.","And finally we are committed to maintaining our capital deployment strategy as we continue pursuing growth opportunities while returning capital to shareowners through additional share repurchases. So in summary, the first quarter was a great start to our year. It tells me our strategies are working and I believe we are well positioned to carry that momentum through the balance of fiscal 2015 and beyond.","So with that, as a little bit of an overview, let me turn it over now to Patrick to walk us through the financial details of the quarter.","Patrick Allen","Thanks, Kelly and good morning to everyone as well. I would now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of 2015.","I will begin on slide three, where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Total company sales for the quarter increased $172 million or 16% compared to first quarter 2014 sales. Now our first quarter 2015 sales did include $137 million of ARINC revenue compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2014. Income from continuing operations improved $35 million due to the retroactive extension of the Federal R&D tax credit as well as higher earnings from both commercial systems and ARINC. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.28 to $1.26 due to higher net income as well as a lower share count due to our share repurchase program.","Looking next to our operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter, we used $60 million of cash compared to use of $24 million last year. The higher use of cash is due principally to the timing of receivable collections, which was partially offset by a full quarter of cash flows from ARINC, higher organic earnings and lower tax payments.","As we turn to slide four, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $568 million in the quarter, up 9% from $521 million in the first quarter of 2014. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $45 million or 16% to $331 million, primarily due to higher OEM production rates, improved share of airline selectable equipment and higher customer funded development program sales as the trend toward higher customer funded R&D in commercial systems continues. ","Aftermarket sales increased $5 million or 2% to $221 million due to higher service and support revenues partially offset by the absence of a large delivery of spare parts for the Boeing 787 GoldCare program in the first quarter of 2014. Now Commercial Systems first quarter operating earnings increased 13% to $125 million in 2015 with operating margins expanding 70 basis points from 21.3% to 22%. The increase in operating earnings and margins was primarily due to the higher sales.","Moving on to slide five. Government systems revenue decreased by 1% to $509 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As you look revenue by category, sales of avionics increased $3 million or 1% from higher deliveries of tanker transport hardware. Communication product sales declined $9 million or 9%, primarily due to lower JTRS Manpack deliveries, partially offset by higher ARC-210 hardware sales. And both surface solutions and navigation product sales were about flat. Government first quarter operating earnings increased $1 million to $106 million resulting in an operating margin of 20.8% compared to 20.4% in the first quarter of last year. The increased operating earnings and margins resulted from favorable mix partially offset by higher working expense due to favorable warranty adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2014.","Turning to slide six, you see information management services which includes ARINC as well as our legacy flight services business. During the first quarter ARINC contributed $137 million of revenue compared to $6 million in the prior year, which represented just a partial week of revenue since the date of acquisition was December 23, 2013. All remaining revenues are related to the legacy Rockwell Collins flight services business. Now on a pro forma basis, information management services sales increased 20% over the prior year. About half of this increase relates to double-digit sales growth in aviation related sales and about half relates to some unfavorable contract adjustments recorded in the first quarter 2014, which related to some rail programs. Information management services had an operating margin of 14.1% in the quarter and during the quarter ARINC delivered EBITDA margin of 23.4%, reflecting a significantly improved performance over the prior year where ARINC had adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.9%.","Slide seven provides an update of our total R&D investment through the first quarter of the year. Total R&D investment increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to $20 million in higher customer funded R&D on international commercial systems programs, $4 million of higher company funded R&D and $12 million of lower preproduction engineering spend. The lower preproduction engineering spend was due primarily to lower spend on the A350 program. And looking to the full year, we expect total R&D to be about $1 billion, which is up $50 million from our initial guide with the majority of the increase coming from customer funded R&D in both commercial systems and government systems.","Moving to slide eight, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, our debt to EBITDA ratio edged up to 2.0 from 1.9 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper used to fund share repurchases. I believe this level of debt still provides us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs and I expect it to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow traditionally results later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt. And we expect to continue paying down the commercial paper balance over the course of the next few years.","The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on slide nine. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average cost of $80.45. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $131 million.","I would like to turn now to our final slide, slide 10, where we provide the details of our updated fiscal year 2015 financial guidance for continuing operations. Guidance for sales, operating earnings is unchanged from our initial guide last September. Due to the retroactive extension of the Federal R&D tax credit, we improved our guidance range for earnings per share by $0.20 and our guidance range for cash flow from operations by $25 million. We have also increased our research and development investment by $50 million to about $1 billion as I mentioned previously. And our guidance for capital expenditures remains unchanged at about $200 million for the year.","That completes my review of financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those additional questions as time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just on just a quick question, just to start on ARINC and IMS, just as we try to learn this business a little bit better. It obviously grew a lot year-over-year. Pat, you talked about the negative adjustment there, given about half of that growth. But if you look at that business sequentially, it looked to the to be down and I wondered if you might come and give us some color, if that's seasonality or if there is lumpiness in that airports and rail business that I think we have seen in the past couple of quarters? Can you give us a sense of what that business look likes sequentially and maybe in the component pieces of airports and rail and other?","Patrick Allen","Yes. I think it's a little bit of both, Carter. If you are thinking about the projects business, there is a seasonality element to it, just because we have fewer working days in the quarter. The other part of it, though, is some inherent lumpiness, particularly in the airports business between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. The combination of those two things really led to the sequential decline. So I think going forward, as we understand the business more, you are going to see a sequential or you are going to see a seasonality component to our first quarter, but there will always be that lumpiness that's less predictable in the airports business.","Carter Copeland","Okay. So it's reasonable to assume that going forward and if we exclude airports and rail, we will still see a seasonal, a very modest decline in Q1?","Patrick Allen","I think that's a fair way to think about it. Yes.","Carter Copeland","Okay, and just as a quick follow-up, is there any financial implications to know because of the Lear 85 pause? How are you think about that?","Patrick Allen","Well, from the Lear 85, we have about $30 million, a little bit less than $30 million deferred on our balance sheet. We do have a contractual guarantee related to it and we been through the contractual and legal reviews. We feel very comfortable that it's an enforceable contractual guarantee. What we are working through right now with Bombardier is what is the future of that program and I think it's fair to say there is a lot of uncertainty around that right now, but we have $30 million deferred and we anticipate no write-off.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay. Carter, this is Kelly. Let me give you a little more, maybe longer-term color there. This doesn't come as a surprise that the program was paused. We took the revenue, as you know, out of our forecast for 2015. Now we do have the Lear 85 program baked into our long-term outlook. So it will be interesting to see, does the program come back on or do we go to termination. As Pat said, I am not worried about the liability of the deferred engineering. In terms of long-term impact to us, it kind of depends on what happens. I am sure if the program doesn't come back online, that the demand for the airplanes won't go away. It will just go to different places then Bombardier will likely try to move them into one of their other aircraft, like a Challenger 350. If they lose those customers, they are likely to go either to Cessna, Embraer, or Gulfstream, IAI. So it's kind of depending on how that all works will determine whether there is net impact to us in the long run. My feeling on this is that if this allows Bombardier to be more successful on their schedule on CSeries and the Global 7000\/8000, I think it's probably net a good thing for us.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. Thank you for the color, Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Joe.","Joe Nadol","So Patrick, on the receivables, could you outline a little bit the higher-than-expected level, I guess, from my standpoint, in Q1? Just outline whether it was largely billed or unbilled? And then maybe any color you can give by business line or customer?","Patrick Allen","First of all, it's largely billed. And when I say, timing, it really is timing. As a matter of fact, we saw significant collections week and week following the quarter-end. And that happens to us every once in a while just because most of our customers have 12\/31 year-ends and they are managing their cash flow carefully. So I don't anticipate any issue for the full year with respect to cash flow. It really was just a quarter timing issue. In terms of on a by customer basis, it was sort of all over the map there. There were no significant individual customers that I would point to.","Joe Nadol","Okay. The increase in your cash flow guidance, obviously you had the tax credit, you upped your R&D. Could you just build a bridge for us how you are able to raise the cash flow guidance despite the higher R&D?","Patrick Allen","Yes. Well, the higher R&D is largely customer funded. So it's not going to be, in a way, it\u2019s going to be a positive cash flow impact for us. And then the R&D tax credit, I think it's probably to the tune of about $30 million of cash flow for us. So when you combine the two, that leads us to the cash flow increase.","Joe Nadol","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start on the defense side. So if you correct for R&D and the warranty claims on a year-on-year basis, you had pretty nice margin expansion and you attributed it to mix, but given it is pretty low volume here in the first quarter, I imagine the volume is going to help you through the rest of the year. Is mix actually going to start to hurt you through the rest of the year? Or is there more upside in government margins than usual?","Patrick Allen ","We always hope there's upside to the margins, but I would say that the mix will probably be a slight negative over the course of the balance of the year.","Kelly Ortberg","Myles, we also will see a little bit of increased spending on the year in expensed R&D and government systems. So that will offset a little bit of that as well.","Myles Walton","All right and then on customer funded R&D or the increase in R&D is customer funded, that's putting upward pressure on your sales, I imagine. Is it effectively pushing you to the top end of the range already? Or are there some offsets in the end markets that you are kind of --","Patrick Allen","We certainly hope that it presents revenue opportunity for us for the full year. The one thing that's impacting us a little bit, just on the topline more than the bottomline, is currency. We have always said that we don't have a significant exposure to currency, but it has moved so significantly since we have set our plan that if rates stay where they are, particularly the Euro exchange rate with the dollar, we are looking at probably about $30 million impact for the full year. That's the ones negative that we are watching, but on balance, I think it does indicate some level of opportunity.","Myles Walton","Okay, great. I will stop there. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ron Epstein","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi, Ron.","Ron Epstein","So Kelly, just maybe a broad question for you. How would you characterize what you guys are seeing in the business jet market now from your customers? And then, I guess, everybody is trying to understand if we are really seeing mids and lights pickup? Would you characterize it that way? How would you describe it?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, Ron, remember, for if to pick up for us, means OEMs have to increase their rates of production. We are clearly seeing early indicator signs with utilization rates and that things are picking up a little bit. I would say nothing that changes our outlook at the low-end in terms of production rates. As you know, we forecasted that most of the market recovery will be through the new products that are being brought into the market and I think that's what we are seeing. So the new demand is going to the new airplanes. Nothing material yet. If you look at the overall environment, if the oil effect drives a little bit of GDP growth, maybe we will see better than we have expected recovery there in the market, but nothing meaningfully yet.","Ron Epstein","Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Kelly, could you give us maybe just a clarification. How does the wind down investment base kind of flow through on the A350? Is it done something where it's basically already completed? Or do we still have to finish some for the remaining part of this fiscal year?","Kelly Ortberg","For all practical purposes, we are through the major development. We always have a little bit of work to do associated with entry into service and supporting the initial customer. So it's not completely done but getting through the certification and entry into service really marks the milestone of the end of the major expenses. And recall that a lot of that is in our deferred engineering spend. And that's been a part of our plan all along to get that program into service and start bringing down our spending in deferred engineering.","Peter Arment","Okay and Kelly, if I could just ask a quick one on that. Is there anyway to quantify what the spare parts demand in terms of the aftermarket would have been in commercial without the absence of the large delivery of spare parts tied to the GoldCare program?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes, probably mid-single-digit.","Peter Arment","Mid-single-digit. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Kelly, a question on the aftermarket. You can talk about large jets and small jets in this context. Do you think the oil price coming down and the increase in airline profit should help your sales of discretionary product?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. In my opinion, the one big positive and probably the earliest positive impact we would see associated with lower oil prices would be in the aftermarket. Now, you know that's going to be muted by the fact that most of the major airlines are hedged. So the windfall will be over time.","I actually think it's more likely that we will see faster impact in business aviation, because the fuel price isn't typically hedged there and it is in a common budget element, the whole operating costs. So we may see higher utilization because the flight departments have more money that they didn't spend on fuel and they could either fly more or afford some discretionary mods for the aircraft.","Now, I will also say, we haven't baked into any of that yet into our forecast, I think the timing of that is yet to be seen a little bit. But maybe towards the end of the year, we should start seeing some. If oil stays low, we should start seeing some flow through of that spend.","Robert Stallard","Okay and as a quick follow-up on the after market. I was wondering if you could tell us what the business jet after-market trends were like in the quarter.","Kelly Ortberg","The flight MRO trended pretty consistently. We did have a little bit of lumpy timing in some of our mandate updates in business aviation. But there is nothing in the market that -- we posted pretty low 2% aftermarket numbers, which isn't a surprise. We kind of signaled that. There is nothing I see in the market that's going to keep us from achieving our forecast of high single digits in the overall aftermarket.","Robert Stallard","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Strauss from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Good morning. Kelly, on the growth rate commercial air transport OE, you cited airline selectable market-share gains. Can you give us a little bit more color there in terms of product and maybe platforms where you are really seeing share gains come through?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. On the legacy aircraft, most of our equipment is buyer furnished equipment or selectable at the airlines. And so you have seen, we have been doing quite well over the past several years in capturing that business. And that just flowed through in that. This quarter, we had a really nice mix of customers that had selected our buyer furnished equipment. From an aircraft perspective, it was really more driven on the 777 and the A320 products this past quarter,","David Strauss","Okay and as a follow-up, could you talk about your progress on the KC-46 program? Obviously Boeing, there's a lot of speculation out there in terms of how Boeing is doing, but can you talk about from how you see things?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. We are on-schedule, on-plan, supporting them. The first flight included, obviously, our flight deck equipment. It did not include the mission package equipment. That gets put on after the green aircraft flight. But everything is going really well. And in fact we are ramping down our development on the program. We will be ramping down throughout this fiscal year. And then we will start to pick up when we get the follow-on order. Right now we are on order for just the four FDD aircraft. And so we have got the follow-on 18 airplanes to start building here next year.","Everything looks good, David, on that program. Really proud of the team, both in terms of meeting all the expectations but our financial performance in the development is doing quite well. So we are doing a good job.","David Strauss","Great. Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","Yes. Good morning. Question, if I look at the incremental margins in commercial air, about 30% now, it may have been a little higher, Patrick. I don't know how much of the $4 million increase in R&D was commercial. But I also wanted to ask, was there a change in the incentive comp in the quarter where you have been running? Or was this kind of a normal quarter?","Patrick Allen","I would say, it's a normal quarter for incentive comp. If you adjust for the R&D, I think the incremental is about 35% and we have signaled that there are going to be quarters where the incrementals aren't quite as high just because of the volume of customer funded R&D. And that's really what's driving the incremental margins down a little bit from where we normally are.","George Shapiro","You have always commented in the past that you make up a similar margin in OE versus aftermarket. I assume that hasn't changed. Or is that a little bit more biased less for the OE?","Patrick Allen","No. But I think it really hasn't changed much. What we have talked about in terms of lower margin stuff, one is the customer funded R&D that we have already talked about and the second is when we are introducing new products they tend to come at slightly lower margins. But if you think about our legacy OEM business and our legacy aftermarket business, both very high margin.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. So you indicated that most of the $50 million increment in R&D is basically customer-funded. Can you give us some sense, is most of that in commercial in air transport OE? What programs, what areas and also what does that imply for deferred engineering and company-funded R&D? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi. I think company funded has actually taken up a little bit to our deferred spend. I don't think if it's going to change much at all. And in terms of the composition of the increase in customer funded R&D, about equal parts government and commercial. The commercial piece is really development programs on international platforms, as we have talked about before. And the government side, it's a scattering of other programs.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. Well given you are up 22% in air transport OE in the quarter, even all the explanations, you gave a spectacular gain. Does that mean that air transport OE this year would look like you could maybe be up 12% to 14%, something like that, even with deceleration later on? Is that a reasonable guess?","Kelly Ortberg","That's not a bad guess. No.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky","Good morning. Thanks. Kelly, I was wondering if you could just update us on your assumptions with regard to CSeries volumes, both this year and the ramp going forward, to start?","Kelly Ortberg","I am sorry. I didn't hear the question. Was it CSeries, you asked?","Jason Gursky","Yes, CSeries. Just the assumptions that you have on volumes, for this year and going forward.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. As you recall, we de-risked the plan quite a bit with CSeries. So I think we had about a half a point of commercial systems revenue associated with CSeries and we don't need any kind of a ramp to meet that revenue. So I am pretty confident that we are going to meet the revenue plan for this year. And then we haven't provided any guidance in terms of the ramp-up and I think we are still waiting to see from Bombardier in terms of the ramp-up in production in the out years.","Jason Gursky","Okay and then can you just provide an update as well on the business development efforts and where there are opportunities to garner some more content on various programs either on the military side or the commercial side? What are you guys actively working on these days?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, there is obviously some big programs in DOD that are in the competition phase and you can imagine we are probably involved in almost all of those programs, particularly for airborne platforms. Internationally, we have got helicopter platforms, additional opportunities in the marketplace, next-generation JTRS is still of pursuit for us, as we try to move from development and low rate initial production to the production competition for those.","In terms of the commercials, BFE remains a big part of our portfolios. So every day we are out competing for the buyer furnished equipment associated with any of the legacy aircraft buys. And then we are out really focusing on optimizing our aftermarket positions with these new standard airplanes. And that presents some big opportunities for us to work with the airlines for provisioning plans, sparing plans and support plans going forward.","You know, I don't see a lot of, right now in the commercial space, a lot of new clean sheet aircraft I think everybody is really focused on finishing what they have got on their table and getting those aircraft into service.","Jason Gursky","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. Patrick, on the last conference call you talked about timing of taxes and talked about how the first half was going to be a much higher rate than the second half. With the R&D tax credit now approved, does that still hold true for the second quarter?","Patrick Allen","Yes. What I think I signaled in the last conference call was about 33% rate for the first half of the year. Obviously with the R&D tax credit flowing in the first quarter, that's not true anymore. But as I look into the second quarter, we get a partial benefit of the R&D tax credit. Think about the tax rate as being about 32.5% for the second quarter and then coming down from that in the back-half of the year.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay and then with an aftermarket growth of the 2%, but you had said it was mid-single if we took out last year's big provisioning. It still needs to accelerate a decent amount to get to a high single-digit for the year. What's really going to be behind the pick up that we see in the remaining three quarters?","Patrick Allen","Well, you are going to see that pickup right away here in the second quarter. And the real growth drivers are going to be around mandates. This is as we said, the peak year and we are seeing the order flow associated with the mandate pick up and then retrofits, HUDS in China, cabin and flight deck updates are the key drivers there for the retrofit in the second half.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay and then if I can ask one more on the 777X. I know you said you are going to expense it. Can you just talk about the timing or the profile? And I don't know if there's any way to size how much spending and over what period of time you are going to have to absorb?","Patrick Allen","Yes. What I would say is, there is going to be a relatively modest spend this year and it will be accelerating over the next couple of years. And I would say probably peak spending will be in 2017 and coming down from there","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard Safran","Hi. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Richard Safran","I just had a quick question here on pre-production engineering. If I did the math correct, it looks like pre-production engineering was down or maybe a bit, I am sorry, less negative by about $6 million year-over-year, up or more negative by about $1 million quarter-over-quarter. And I am looking at the numbers on the cash flow statement, not what's on slide seven. So if you could, maybe can you talk about the trajectory, what it's going to look like for the rest of the year? Is this going to be lumpy? Well, maybe more linear? Have any of the drivers changed since last quarter?","Kelly Ortberg","What I would say is, Richard, it is going to be pretty linear. As I look at the profile and I am looking at it right now, we may see a modest uptick in the second quarter in our deferred spend, but think of it as being pretty linear across the rest of the year.","Richard Safran","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert","Yes, hi. Good morning. Kelly, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments, specifically, regarding the mandate pick up. To what extent are you seeing that for your 5-7 and 6-7 replacement packages that you recently announced in terms of the cockpit of the avionics?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. So the mandate pick up that I was talking about was specifically related to the Link 2000 and the TCAS change. So not driven by the flight deck up update. We do have our second customers. I commented that the last call. So we are pretty firm. That will also drive some growth in the second half as we deliver those updates to our unannounced customers for that.","Ken Herbert","Okay. But just to follow-up, you are getting a sense that on those particular planes, the airlines are, maybe with what's happened with the fuel environment, a little more open to spending there on those upgrades? Maybe they are a little easier to process? Or how are you seeing that?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, I would say, the fuel is not going to hurt. It certainly is going to help. But, even before fuel was what it is today, we were seeing strong interest from customers who are going to fly those aircraft for a lot longer to go ahead and do the mods. I think we will have some additional customers in terms of orders by the end of our fiscal year. It probably won't convert to any sales just because of the timing from order to sale there. So I think for this year, we are pretty firm in terms of what we need to do on those aircraft. Yes, fuel should be in that good news for that product line offering.","Ken Herbert","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe staying on the after-market theme, can you guys talk about will A350 sparing create some of a tailwind? And can you also talk about just some of the trends you are seeing at your Intertrade unit with surplus parts? Is that market becoming tighter given fuel prices? Maybe just some color there.","Kelly Ortberg","I don't think we have seen any meaningful change in our Intertrade used business as a result of fuel prices. In general, this fuel price, I think the impact is going to come later. I think the fact of the matter is, everybody is still operating on the same budgets that they had when they started their year. So you know, I don't expect to see significant change here in the near-term associated with fuel prices.","Patrick Allen","The other part of your question, it was the A350 spares and the magnitude, what we are going to see this year. I would describe it as being pretty modest and the reason is because there is really only one significant customer in 2015 and that's Qatar. So we don't have quite the volume of mix that we had in the 787 rollout. And so I think there will sparing activity, at least this year.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, that's helpful and then just Kelly, on the synergies with ARINC. I know you guys called out $10 million a year, climbing to $50 million. Any update there? Have you guys identified additional synergies? Or do you think you can boost those numbers as we progress and the integration moves on?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. We continue to track to our plan there. I have discussed the synergies of combining our flight services business for international and domestic under our new product brand ARINCDirect and that's a combination of additional customers as well as cross-selling capabilities that each independent company had and we continue to track to our plan and gain new customers, but also gain more volume with the existing customers.","So I feel really good about that tracking to our plan. Some of our longer term synergies, now we have got a well-defined. We have got development activities underway for our product or service offerings. Nothing we are ready to announce right now, but those are coming. And then more importantly, our cost synergy performance is really good. And as part of what's allowing us to achieve those 23% EBITDA margins for the quarter.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Very good, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you. Kelly, you talked a little bit earlier about the strength of the dollar. And so, how are your international and emerging market customers coping with this unexpected headwind relative to, in many cases, their natural currency?","Kelly Ortberg","We really haven't seen any change to-date, but we are pretty early in the process. Most of our orders that we delivered in the quarter were placed last year. So no, we haven't really seen much impact, at least to-date, with respect to our international customer base.","Howard Rubel","No, I am not sure about the timing. I mean I think it's probably a watch item and in some cases, obviously they have natural hedges. It just struck me that it's such a sharp move. Also related to that is the sanctions in Russia seem to have had some impact on some companies. How are you managing to continue to support your business jet customers in that market?","Kelly Ortberg","No change and we are not overly exposed in Russia. So I don't anticipate any impact there.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, both, gentlemen.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","Yes. As a follow-up, can you provide at all what your content per plane is going to be on the 350 and the 777X versus the 777 currently?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, you know, George, we do not disclose our shipset content on any of the aircraft. I will repeat what we have said in the market. We said that the A350 will be about $2.5 billions. The 777X will be about $2 billion, the 787 and the 737 MAX are similar in size, combine them there will $7billion to $8 billion of total revenue. So that gives you kind of magnitude of the programs going forward. Now, recognize the quantities of the business cases across all those are different.","George Shapiro","Okay, let me ask one follow-up then one Kelly. If you could describe, I don't know much about the SITA business that you compete with, with ARINC. But if I just look at some of the data that you can get, it seems like they are seeing much slower growth rates, like maybe 3%, 4% where you are saying you are seeing like 10%. So maybe you could describe a little what it is that you are doing that's different than what they are doing that's giving you the higher growth rates?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, if you look at their portfolio and our portfolios, they don't really, there are no one-for-one overlap. They are our biggest competitor in our ARINC business, but they have got other support businesses that we don't have. And I don't think they disclose their revenues, at least, I am not aware of it, in a way that you can do a one-to-one comparison. I would suspect they are seeing higher growth in the comparable business that they do because we are seeing it driven by the market. It's not as significant. What we are seeing is not significant market share gains beyond the synergy areas. Most of it is market uplift.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Thanks. So as a follow-up, any update on the ASES potential to sell that business?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, we are still working it. We had a buyer last quarter. That deal fell through. But we are currently working with another potential buyer. So hopefully within the next couple of quarters, we will get the thing sold.","David Strauss","Okay. Kelly, the NTSB yesterday came out with a whole bunch of recommendations around getting, basically, flight information faster. Could you talk about how that could potentially help your ARINC business? I know they are only recommendations at this point, but it seems to be that we are moving in that direction.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. Most of the more frequent updates would go likely over the ACARS network which will drive revenue. I said this in the past that all the capability exists to report the position of the aircraft. They aren't doing it at the frequency that they could. I don't think it's going to drive a material impact to our overall business. It's not going to take a lot of data to provide more frequent updates to aircraft position.","David Strauss","Okay. And Patrick, was there any change in the forecast for ARINC on the intangible amortization side?","Patrick Allen","No. No, it's staying steady.","David Strauss","Okay, thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Ryan Miller","Thank you. We plan to file our Form 10-Q later today. So please review that document for additional disclosures. Thank you for joining us and participating on today's conference call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and management introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rockwell Collins' Vice President of Investor Relations, Ryan Miller. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shawn, and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins' Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen.","Today's call is being webcast. And you can view the slides we'll be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab. These slides include certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure.","Please note today's presentation and webcast will include certain projections and statements that are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time-to-time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our overall performance for fiscal year 2015, which is highlighted by mid-single digit sales growth and double digit growth in earnings and cash flow, which is right in line with our long-term goals. And our ability to deliver 13% operating cash flow growth and 15% earnings per share growth, especially in a year when we were negatively impacted by foreign currency rates and a weaker than expected commercial aftermarket, was particularly notable.","As I reflect on the year, our performance not only delivered strong results, but it also paves the way for future growth. We announced a number of new program wins and achieved significant milestones on development programs that I expect will continue to drive growth over the next decade. This was particularly true in Commercial Systems, where, earlier in the year, we announced that Boeing had awarded us a contract to provide our display systems, integrated surveillance systems, and flight control systems for the 777X, providing an important market share gain and completing our suite of the flight decks for Boeing's next-generation airplanes.","And just recently, we announced that Boeing had also selected us to provide the avionics gateway server for the 777X, which adds another component to our information management strategy. As a result of these positions, the 777X will now rival the 787 in the amount of Rockwell Collins equipment per aircraft.","We also announced that our Pro Line Fusion flight deck was selected by Textron for its next-generation King Air aircraft, including the industry's first touchscreen primary flight displays. In addition, we marked a key win with Dassault, who chose our advanced cabin management and entertainment systems for its new Falcon Jet 5X and 8X aircraft, continuing our role as a sole cabin supplier for its entire new aircraft fleet.","From a development program perspective, we saw the Airbus A350 and the Embraer Legacy 500 each achieve their first deliveries during the year. In addition, the Legacy 450 was recently certified. We're also working on a number of additional development programs that are nearing completion and will enter service in the near future. The CSeries is nearly complete with its flight test and is expected to enter service during our fiscal year 2016. And the 737 MAX program appears to be in really good shape and is expected to enter service during our 2017 fiscal year, with 1.5 times the Rockwell Collins' content of the current-generation 737.","These are all very important programs for our company and are expected to drive growth over the next several years. We also strengthened our portfolio of connectivity-related offerings within Commercial Systems during the year. Our March acquisition of Pacific Avionics helps to ensure Rockwell Collins can offer our customers advanced wireless distribution onboard aircraft, strengthening our ability to deliver leading applications through our PES, passenger engagement solution.","And in August, we acquired ICG, or International Communications Group, adding the latest generation of Iridium satcom terminals and smart routers to our existing flight deck and cabin connectivity offering. So, as you can see, our Commercial Systems business really had a busy year. And they delivered strong financial results as well, posting 6% sales growth and expanding operating margins by 70 basis points.","Moving now to Government Systems, I really feel like we hit an inflection point this year. Despite facing almost $100 million of headwinds associated with the JTRS Manpack program, as well as what turned up to be about $40 million of foreign currency impact, I was extremely pleased with our sales performance. In fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew a little in Government Systems this year and continued to maintain our strong operating margins of about 21%.","During the year, we announced a number of key contract wins, including a $420 million multi-year contract for our ARC-210 advanced airborne software defined radios for the Naval Air Systems Command.","In addition, we were awarded a $478 million multi-year contract for the production of MIDS JTRS terminals through our Data Link Solutions joint venture. And we continued our success in the rotary wing market, where we've secured almost all of the future AgustaWestland helicopter programs. And we were also selected to provide the avionics and mission equipment for the next-generation U.S. Air Force Combat Rescue Helicopter.","In Government Systems, we also achieved a number of critical milestones in development programs this year. For example, we executed on-time development of equipment for the KC-46, the KC-390, both of which achieved their first flights this year. We also delivered the first Generation III Helmet Mounted Display System for the F-35 through our Rockwell Collins ESA Vision Systems joint venture. So, all-in, it was a really good year for our Government Systems, as we look to this business growing now in fiscal 2016.","Shifting now to Information Management Service business, we delivered double digit growth on the core aviation side of the business and expanded segment operating margins by 200 basis points. We also met our sales synergy goals for the year. And I can see real evidence that we're making progress in expanding our connectivity offering. Some examples include the launch of our live credit card authorization capability with Hong Kong Airlines. And we unveiled our ARINC MultiLink flight tracking service as well as our ARINC UrgentLink disaster communication network. UrgentLink actually has a nice synergy with our Government Systems business using our HF communication technology to provide a nation-wide network for disaster recovery communications.","Now, turning to fiscal 2016, we're going to experience some near-term challenges, particularly in the first half of the year. Our Government Systems program timing is going to result in declines in the first half and growth in the second half of the fiscal year. And in Commercial Systems, production cuts on the Bombardier Globals will impact the whole fiscal year, while growth from our new acquisitions will primarily benefit the second half.","So, while it won't be linear, I still expect that we will continue to grow our overall business during fiscal 2016 and deliver strong margin and cash flow performance. And Patrick's going to cover this in a little more detail, as he reviews our guidance for fiscal year 2016.","So, in summary, 2015 was a good year, where we executed according to our plan across our three businesses, accelerated growth in ways that we expect will continue to enhance our long-term outlook. And while 2016 is going to be a bit of bump in terms of our overall growth rate, I remain optimistic concerning our long-term growth drivers for our company looking forward.","So with that, let me turn it over to Patrick to walk us through the financials details.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company fourth quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.","Total company sales for the quarter decreased $18 million, or 1%, compared to fourth quarter last year, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency rates. Income from continuing operations increased $11 million, or 6%. And earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.11, or 9%, compared to the same period last year. The rate of increase in earnings per share from continuing operations was more than the rate of income in continuing operations, because of the favorable impacts of our share repurchase program.","As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $636 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $8 million, or 2%, to $372 million, primarily due to lower sales for Chinese regional aircrafts, partially offset by higher deliveries in support of the A350 and Legacy 500 entries into service. Aftermarket sales increased $8 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher regulatory mandate sales, partially offset by lower spares provisioning for the Boeing 787 program.","Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $5 million, or 4%, with operating margins improving 90 basis points from 22.1% to 23%. Operating margin benefited from lower company-funded research and development expense and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation expense.","Moving on to Slide 5, Government Systems revenue decreased by 4% to $581 million, driven by lower JTRS Manpack sales, lower rotary wing hardware sales, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, all partially offset by higher tanker\/transport hardware deliveries and increased sales from development effort on modernized GPS products. Government Systems fourth quarter operating earnings decreased $8 million to $129 million, resulting in an operating margin of 22.2%, compared to the 22.6% in the fourth quarter last year.","The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from: the lower sales volume; higher investment in research and development expense; and higher employee incentive compensation expense, partially offset by favorable hardware product mix and cost saving initiatives.","Turning now to Slide 6, Information Management Services sales increased 6% over the prior year, as commercial and business aviation services sales increased low double digits, partially offset by lower sales from the non-aviation-related businesses, due to the timing of certain airport programs and the exit of a government program. Information Management Services fourth quarter operating earnings increased $8 million to $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.4% compared to the 13.3% in the fourth quarter last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to: higher sales volume; a very favorable mix of higher margin aviation-related sales; and the absence of certain licensing costs incurred in the prior year.","Looking next to Slide 7, we show our full year fiscal 2015 results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. If there's any slide I'd like to pause and reflect on, this is the slide. Fiscal 2015 was a great year for Rockwell Collins. In a year where we were posted double digit growth in income and earnings per share, I was particularly pleased with 13% growth in operating cash flow. We had a great fourth quarter that led to our highest ever operating cash flow total for any fiscal year in our company's history.","For the full year, we generated $749 million of operating cash flow compared to $660 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher earnings, coupled with a focus on receivable collections and controlling production inventory, as well as lower pre-production engineering spend.","Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment for the full year. Total spend increased from $934 million in fiscal 2014 to $986 million in fiscal 2015. Company-funded R&D increased $4 million, due to increased spend associated with positioning Government Systems for new growth opportunities, partially offset by lower A350 development cost in Commercial Systems. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $74 million, due to: higher development costs for international programs in Commercial Systems; higher costs for next-generation avionics programs in Government Systems; and higher amortization of pre-production engineering costs. Pre-production engineering investment, net, decreased due to lower spending on the A350 program.","Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we were able to pay down our short-term debt of $297 million, going from $745 million at the end of the third quarter to $448 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Our current debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7, as detailed on Slide 11. I believe this level of debt still allows us the necessary cost-effective access to fund our capital needs and expect to modestly decline by the end of fiscal 2016, as we balance our debt pay-down with share repurchases, dividends and, hopefully, some acquisition opportunities.","Now on to Slide 10, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which is unchanged from our initial fiscal 2016 guidance issued in September. Commercial Systems sales are expected to grow low single digits, as high single digit growth in air transport is expected to be offset by a decline in the mid-single digits for business and regional, due primarily to the production cuts on the Global 5000 and 6000.","Government Systems sales are expected to be up low single digits, paced by mid-single digit international growth and a relatively flat U.S. DoD sales. And Information Management Services are expected to grow high single digits.","Now, before I move on, I wanted to talk through some dynamics that will impact our sales between the first and second half of fiscal 2016 in Commercial Systems and Government Systems. Within Commercial Systems, because of the impact of lower Global production rates in the first half and timing of entries into service, we're expecting a relatively flattish first half of the year in Commercial Systems. In the second half of the year, we should get some additional benefit from rates increasing on the 787 and narrow-body aircraft at Airbus. In addition, we get more benefit in the second half as the A350 and Embraer Legacies accelerate their rates and we begin to see initial CSeries production. The acquisitions that we've completed in fiscal 2015, particularly the Pacific Avionics' wireless distribution business, is also expected to ramp its production in the second half of the year. So what does this mean? Most all of our growth for the year in Commercial Systems will be back-end weighted.","Within Government Systems, we expect tanker\/transport sales to be relatively flat in the first half and accelerate in the second half, primarily due to a few international C-130 upgrade programs. In other avionics programs, we expect the first half to be down and the back half of fiscal 2016 will benefit from the timing of simulation and training programs, as well as a Black program.","We also expect surface sales to be down in the first half of the year due to lower targeting system revenues, electronic intelligence programs and expect these programs to be relatively flat in the second half of the year compared to fiscal 2015. What does this mean to overall Government Systems? We will likely be down mid-single digits in the first half of the year and expect all of our growth will be in the back half of the year.","Another area that will impact our first and second half fiscal year 2016 is our effective income tax rate. As we noted in our fiscal 2016 guidance issued in September, we expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be about 28%. And we're exploring a number of potential tax savings opportunities that will likely impact our tax rate in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect some lumpiness in the quarterly tax rate, with it being in the range of 33% for the first two quarters and lower in the back half of the year. Just as a reminder, our guidance assumes that we will not get any benefit from the Federal R&D tax credit.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections, so, Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan D. Miller - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those additional questions, as time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If you can review maybe what makes you comfortable with your aftermarket outlook for 2016, be it that aftermarket seems like it's been all over the place for everybody. How do you feel comfortable with your outlook and then how do you make us feel comfortable with it?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we certainly adjusted our outlook based on the results we've seen through fiscal 2015. And there's no question that we saw a softer aftermarket than we originally guided to in fiscal 2015. So, if you look at what we're forecasting, the air transport, we said high single digit overall for air transport growth. I think that's going to be relatively balanced between OEM and aftermarket in terms of growth rates. We've got some pretty good demand, good visibility on HUD retrofits in the air transport market. That'll drive some of that, somewhat offset by reduced demand on some of the mandate revenues.","We also see in the second half that, as Patrick said, much of the growth of the acquisitions is in the second half and much of that comes through the aftermarket, as they're doing aftermarket retrofits. We've been pretty conservative in our outlook for the MRO component. I think, as you know, the MRO in bus av really tracks with the utilization. And air transport, we have seen recycling this past year. I think that's going to continue. We've got that factored into our forecast, but we are seeing pretty good demand because we are also in the used parts business with our Intertrade. So, we're offsetting some of that softer recycling MRO by actually selling used components.","So, I think we're going to see pretty flat to low single digit growth in the overall sparing for the year. And, I think we've taken into account our experiences here this past year and forecasted those in our outlook here going forward.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about CapEx. And this is not meant to pick at all, but the number for the year, $210 million, came in a little higher than the $200 million guidance. You guided for $200 million again this year. It's up around 4% of sales. Is that mostly in the ARINC business? And, if so, where is it? What is the trajectory like as we look out further from here?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Seth, I'd say the uptick has certainly been in the ARINC business. And, I think what you're going to see is probably holding steady around $200 million for the next few years. We've substantially increased the investment in ARINC compared to what they had prior to our ownership. And, it's really funding a number of different growth areas for us. So, although I don't expect that spending to decline materially, I also don't see it increasing over the course of the next few years. So, I think, at $200 million as being a pretty good benchmark for the next few years.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, related bus jet class gen's first, Bombardier, I guess, said that they're throwing in the towel on the Lear 85. When would you expect to get reimbursement for your deferred engineering there? And secondly, can we expect any announcement of new product wins, on your part, at NBAA? Thank you.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, okay, so we have about $27 million on the books associated with the Lear 85 program. This termination will trigger the reimbursement of that. I don't know off the top of my head the payment terms of it. I mean, we just heard that as well. So, we'll be exercising that here over the next quarter. What was the second question?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Anything new wins at NBAA?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nothing that I'm going to preannounce in the call today.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, I don't want you to preannounce it, but are we likely to have any announcements?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We always have announcements, Cai, at NBAA.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks much. Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rob.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Kelly, I was wondering if you could comment on the Government Systems outlook and what you've factored into this in relation to what's going in D.C. Did you imagine there was going to be a full year CR or this budget deal or anything else like that?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Our baseline plan was that we would have a one quarter CR and a budget deal before Christmas. And generally, a one quarter CR doesn't have any full year impact to our overall revenue forecast. If you recall, a couple of years ago, that was extended beyond the quarter and we did see some impact. So that was the baseline assumption. The budget deal is a good outcome here.","We now need to get the appropriators together and get this CR budget complete and appropriations complete before Christmas, which it looks like that's going to happen. I don't think the fact that we got a little bit of budget above the sequester level, probably is not going to have much impact to us in 2016, but certainly bolsters our long-term outlook for growth in our government business for domestic programs.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. A quick follow-up if I may, the LRSB announcement the other day, I don't know if you can comment on this, but does that have any impact on your forecast?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can make no comment on that.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Myles. Are you there?","Operator","Myles Walton?","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry, yeah. Thanks. Good morning. First question I had was on you've mentioned the 1.5 times content on the MAX versus the NG in the 737. You made a comment on the 777X rivaling the 787. Can you put the 777X relative to the current 777? Is it a similar 50% increase in content or any measure you can put around it?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's roughly two times our current content.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","2X.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then the other one, funded backlog, you usually report at year-end for Defense. And I'm curious what dynamic that saw at year end, to give us an indicator of forward-looking and also whether the Black program that Patrick mentioned is already in that backlog? Thanks.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, actually, when you look at the 10-K disclosure, you're going to see the funded backlog on the government side of the business come down just a little bit. That's actually masking some growth and it's largely due to the effect of foreign currency. I think absent the foreign currency, we would have grown backlog a little bit. I think with the foreign currency impact, you're actually going to see it shrink just a little bit.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Could you maybe delve into the performance in IMS? You mentioned favorable mix in the quarter and maybe how we should think about the profitability outlook for the segment going forward?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the way I'd describe it, Sheila, is that was an unusually profitable quarter for us. I don't see that recurring. We had a couple of favorable adjustments on some programs in the networks business that yielded very high profitability. So I think probably a couple hundred basis points of that was related to, I'll say, those revenue adjustments on those programs that aren't likely to recur.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","And just a quick follow-up if I may, on business jet aftermarket, it was up 7, what's your strength there?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we did see a little bit better utilization. And we saw on the MRO side and on the discretionary side, a pretty good uptick in mandate-related updates, TCAS particularly.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you guys talk a little bit about the CSeries? Just with the announcements yesterday, I guess, two pieces; one, the company had talked about 15 to 20 deliveries in the next year. I'm just wondering how does that compare to the plans for production that you have in your 2016 outlook. And then separately, with regards to the pre-production engineering, does Bombardier's write-down affect your assessment of those capitalized costs and your ability to recoup those costs over the same number of units?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","What I'd say is first of all, with respect to our assumptions in the plan, I'd say the Bombardier announcement certainly solidifies the number of aircraft we had in the plan. If there's any upside, it's pretty modest to the plan there, Sam. And as it relates to the deferred engineering, it really doesn't change our view of the collectability of that deferred engineering. Again, we had different assumptions with respect to the number of CSeries aircraft than Bombardier going into the program. And so we have not reassessed that, at this point.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Two questions; first one, when you guys announced your fiscal 2016 guidance, you talked about, I think, it was $10 million to $15 million in restructuring. Can you detail exactly what that's going to? And is that actually, are any savings included in your guidance for this year? And then the second question, Patrick, could you just walk us, give us a bridge from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 operating cash flo? It looks like you're forecasting relatively \u2013 I mean, you have a range, but mid-point relatively flat. Thanks.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. As it relates to restructuring, we disclosed in our guidance $0.10 to $0.15 of restructuring. And that's largely severance costs. Now, the reason why we posted a range is there is a bit of uncertainty with respect to the take-up rate of a voluntary early retirement program that we're currently in the middle of. So, although it's difficult to assess the impact, I would say the take-up rates to-date has been pretty good. And I would say we're going to be at the high end of that $0.10 to $0.15 range, maybe even a little bit above that range.","Now, as it relates to savings incorporated, we did incorporate some estimated savings in our guidance as well. However, obviously the pick-up rate's higher. We may have a little bit of incremental savings as well that we can flow into the numbers. So, we did have an estimated charge plus some estimated savings, which will true-up here in the first quarter. And I think by the time we release earnings for the first quarter, we should be able to give you a pretty good sense as to where that restructuring charge and the resulting savings is going to be.","As it relates to cash flow, the number that we posted, you're right. The midpoint's about $750 million, about flat. It does mask some improvement, particularly in deferred engineering. And what's causing that to be masked is largely on the income tax line. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're not assuming the benefit of our R&D tax credit. That provided pretty substantial both earnings and cash benefit in FY 2015. And although we're able to offset the earnings impact through some tax planning strategies that I referenced, those aren't going to come with a resulting cash benefit, at least not immediately. We'll get the cash benefit over time. And so we're going to have a substantial increase in cash taxes year-over-year. And that's what's masking the cash flow improvement.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Patrick, in terms of our modeling, so we should assume the restructuring charge comes through in Q1 and then the savings occur as we go throughout the year?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's a very good assumption, yeah. We'll have the charge and then won't have much of any savings in the first quarter and the savings will bleed out over the next three quarters.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Kelly, I wanted to ask sort of a high altitude question, if I could, but with many of your development programs entering service over the next few years, so you've got the A350, some of the Boeing work, MAX, 777X, tanker. Do we, at some point, enter into a bit of an R&D holiday, assuming that there aren't a lot of newer programs behind those and that this could change the slope for your earnings growth at some point?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we talked about the cash flow tailwind we're going to get associated with that, where we're going to see a reduction in deferred engineering spend associated with a lot of those programs. So, yes, that is going to come down. I'm expecting our expensed R&D to continue to stay pretty level as a percent of sales. Now, remember, we're putting things like the 777X now, we're expensing that. So there'll be some program expense there. But we're a technology differentiating company. We're going to continue to invest in new features and functions that we can sell into the aftermarket and stay competitively ahead of the game. So I don't think you'll see from an expensed R&D, any kind of a tailwind there. I think we're going to keep that relatively flat.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just, an unrelated, not really a follow-up, but just another quick question, with the activity that you're seeing at Intertrade, does this give you any kind of read-through to what's been plaguing aftermarket? And is there a point at which Intertrade slows down enough to suggest that the glut in the surplus market might revert to more strength in traditional aftermarket?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it has given us a lot of visibility to what's going on. And it's the parts recycling and there's a couple of components to that. I think we've got aggregators in the market. And when you have aggregators, they can service more aircraft with fewer spares. And I think you're seeing that across the industry, that the aggregators are having effect on historical spares' sales levels.","And then I think using used parts initially started out as a U.S.-based cost-cutting measure. I think it's now turned into a best practice. In fact, in the last quarter, we've seen some international customers, who historically only bought new spares, now using recycled components in their MRO. So, I think that's here to stay. And I don't think we're going to see that turn off in the short-term.","The trick for our Intertrade business is just making sure that we're buying the right components, that have the right demand. And as the aircraft retire, we're going to continue to focus on making sure we're buying those right components. In most cases, we've got a good portion of our business case sold before we actually buy the aircraft and start tearing it down.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, given the global expansion of that activity, is this a business you'd like to grow?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's why we have it. I think it's a good offset. It doesn't come with near the margin that selling new spares and componentry does, but it is something. It's being growing double digit. And I am expecting it's going to grow double digit here in 2016 as well. So, yeah, it's a big component of our overall aftermarket strategy.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rich.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I just wanted to know if you could discuss maybe the progress you're making in connectivity solutions with respect to your partners, Global Xpress, OneWeb, and Iridium. In 2015, Kelly, you talked a lot about the flight tracker and the inflight credit card reader. Do you have anything that's cropped up that you would like to highlight here as a meaningful opportunity you're seeing for 2016?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well. Yeah. Let me give you an update on GX. This is the new broadband service provided by Inmarsat. We've captured our first two customers as a service provider, where we'll be putting the equipment on the aircraft, getting the STC and then have the service, so that's well underway. And I'm pretty excited about that. I think that's one of these synergy areas that's going to continue to grow.","We've got a lot of proposals in works providing connectivity solutions and services, so both the equipment and the connectivity going forward. So I think that's playing out about as we expected and it's going to be a big component of the synergy growth. If you recall, we said about $10 million of synergy last year out of our IMS business. In fact, we achieved about $12 million. Next year, that goes to $20 million. So, we got a step-up of $10 million. And I think connectivity is going to be a big component of that.","Now, we also, as I mentioned in my comments, acquired ICG. ICG provides the new radio set that we also are a value-added reseller of the service. So, we'll be able to go to market for full-end solutions with our customers there as well. And we've got a lot of proposal activity underway. We have transitioned from a trial phase on our global tracking to a revenue-generating phase. We did about a little less than a six month trial with nine leading customers, airlines, and we're now through that. That's been very successful and we'll move that to the revenue-generating phase of the program going forward.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Good morning, Kelly, Patrick, Ryan. Kelly, I guess on IMS, you continue to make great progress there on the aviation-related businesses. You kind of label them as non-aviation portion as kind of holding or at least offsetting some of that growth. Are these non-core businesses or are they just complementing to the overall IMS business?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, they weren't the subject of the acquisition. Let me put it that way. And what we've been doing this past year is focusing on how we can make those businesses less lumpy, less project-based and more sustained revenue. So, they have not grown quite as fast as I had expected when we first made the acquisition. This is going to be a big year for us, because we've got out of some activities that we didn't want to continue. We've refocused those businesses. We're now off selling Positive Train Control as a service, as opposed to a one-time NRE project. And so, I think this is going to be a big year for us. And I'm expecting to see those segments have better growth than what you saw here this past year.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Patrick, I wondered if you could give us just a little bit of color on the IMS sort of more granular trends. I think you had a tough compare in the airports and rail piece for this quarter, but, obviously, the aggregate number was good. I wondered if you might just give us some detail on what those pieces look like and what the trends look like, especially in the bus jet, flight planning stuff, given what we're seeing in terms of utilization in the market right now? Thanks.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Carter, what I think you'll see next year is probably a more steady growth from the IMS business. You're right. We've seen kind of a lot of lumpiness with respect to the non-aviation business. And as we've sort of lined out IMS by quarter, unlike the other two businesses, it's going to be pretty steady growth quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year. And the way I'd characterize it as being high single digit growth; again, still stronger growth in the business and air transport aviation-related segment, and slightly lower growth in the non-aviation-related, the airports, rail and security, over fiscal 2016.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Carter, I'd just add to that that we've had that good growth in spite of some pretty significant headwinds in a number of international trips going in and out of China, Russia, and Brazil. Both those areas have been headwinds, just because of the economic situation in those regions, but we've continued to grow that business in spite of that and we expect that will continue.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great color. And, Kelly, as a follow-up to Rob's question, were you happy on Tuesday night or could you have been happier?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I have no comment.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. I wanted to pursue, it looked like your 2015 revenue growth was slightly below the low end of the guidance that you gave in mid-September. It would seem that that's due to the business jet OE. And if that's true, I was just wondering what happened that you weren't able to foresee it with only a couple of weeks left in the year. And then the follow up is since you didn't change your revenue growth for 2016 versus 2015, does that imply at this point that we're probably at the lower end of the guidance range that you put out? Thanks.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, George, as we close the year, if there's something that didn't meet my expectations, it was not the business aviation revenue, it was actually Government Systems. We had a contract for the installation and equipment associated with the KC-135 Block 45 update. That was planned to be a very late in the year award and then immediate sale of the equipment. We did get the contract, but it came in at a lower number of aircraft than we had anticipated.","And so if I look at where we finished up, our revenue was a little light, a little disappointing from our government business going forward. That's also going to have a little bit of a challenge for us in 2016, because what they chose to do is modify less of the aircraft. This is a multi-year mod program. And they've kind of put those aircraft at the end of the program. If KC-46 can accelerate, those may go away, which, in the end, I don't know that that wouldn't be that good news for us, but it is going to push some aircraft to the right. So it really wasn't a surprise in bus av, it was more a surprise in government business.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And I'd just add, I wouldn't read too much into the impact on FY 2016 guidance. It wasn't a very significant miss for us, and I think we're still well within the range of what we communicated in September.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just going back to the IMS segment, Kelly, you've spoken in the past about bandwidth being a gating factor to growth, and that expectations of the longer-term was that there was going to be more availability of bandwidth for you to provide even more interesting services. Can you talk a little bit about where we are with regard to that bandwidth? I know that there was a launch during the third quarter. I'm just wondering if that's going to have any material impact for that business over the next year or two. Thanks.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, that was my comment on the Global Xpress. That is the broadband communication capability that is just coming online. We're just going through the process of winning the launch customers, as I mentioned, the two. But what we have to do is we have to go \u2013 it's a new radio that goes on the airplane before we can initiate service. We have to go get that radio integrated and certified on each aircraft type. So that will happen throughout year. And, by the way, we're not the only one doing that. Honeywell is doing that for example as well. All bringing this broadband connectivity into the market, so you'll see that grow over the next couple of years. It's not going to be a one and \u2013 it's not going to be a big bang, because it does take time to, first of all, book the STCs in place. And then second of all, get the retrofits all lined up and get the airlines lined up to do those retrofits.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And, Kelly, at one point will all new aircraft go out the door at the OEM level with those radios already installed?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's going to be a few years yet. The OEMs are looking at a forward fit or line fit certification of this kind of capability, but currently they aren't operable as standard equipment on any of the forward fit aircraft. I would guess, and this is just kind of a rough guess, I would guess over the next three years, that will all change. And they'll cut in and we'll be delivering those as selectable equipment. Typically, broadband connectivity, even today, has been selectable by the airline. It's not necessarily standard.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Kelly, how are you thinking about the 777 at this point as it relates to a potential rate cut in your outlook for this year and longer-term? I mean, we had Boeing say it could possibly go as low as seven a month. I know you mentioned you had kind of different assumptions about the CSeries versus what Bombardier had, just kind of wondering if that applies to 777 as well?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, for this year, we've assumed that they sustained rates for fiscal 2016. And, by the way, they would have to cut rates here within the next quarter probably to have any impact on our 2016. So, the real question is how many aircraft in our fiscal 2017 and we've got a little time before we're providing 2017 guidance on that. I suspect we'll have a better handle when we do put that guidance out. Typically, this is an area where we do align pretty closely to what the OEM is saying. We don't find much variability. So, I'd listen to what Boeing says and assume that's going to flow through to us.","By the way, the existing 777 is a pretty high BFE content airplane for us. So it's not \u2013 a rate cut will have some impact on us.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Kelly.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ken.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to follow up on the business jet discussion. I mean, I know when you provided guidance for business jet OE down low double digit, you had a fair amount of conservatism and probably realism baked into your guidance, even just beyond obviously what we've seen at Bombardier. Has anything happened in the last month and a half, two months, since you gave the guidance that may have eaten into some of this conservatism or some of the buffer you had or are you still seeing things as you saw them on the OE side, specifically with business jet, considering all the news we've had recently relative to two months ago?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, the predominance of the low double digit decline was the Globals, then as we said...","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We provided some additional, well, what I'll call, general discount to the mid to light going into the year. No, haven't seen that necessarily consumed. But I'm also \u2013 we're just starting and market conditions have been generally soft. I will say that the announcements or the earnings calls since we put out guidance haven't indicated significant weakness in production rates. So hopefully, I'm wrong and won't need the discount, but I think it's prudent, given the history we've seen. And utilization rates just have not been very strong and backlogs still are relatively weak, so we'll have to see how that plays out.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just then as a follow up, you had a good quarter and I know you talked about this for business jet aftermarket, were there any specific sort of one-time items in the quarter that maybe pulled that forward a little bit? And I know, obviously, you're still sticking to the low single digit outlook for 2016, but any commentary and more detail on the quarter would be helpful.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what really drove in the quarter was mandate-related activity. We've got a couple of new FANS which are navigation system updates that we've got certified and will enter into the market and we started to see a little bit of that. But I'd say the good quarter was, from a discretionary perspective, was predominantly the mandate-related activity. That mandate activity is going to \u2013 is not going to grow in 2016. That will probably be a little bit of a headwind for us going forward into 2016.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Hi. Yeah, just two quick follow ups, what would the growth have been in the large OE aftermarket if you took out the 787 provisioning?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I guess about mid-single digits.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Because I would think in 2016, that negative issue isn't going to be there because I would assume it's probably compensating...","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would agree. We've sort of reached a steady state run rate on 787 sparing. So, I agree with you. I don't think that's going to be a headwind next year for us.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","And then just one quick one, Patrick, how much higher was incentive comp roughly at the commercial and government areas?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It was $16 million in total, George, split basically 50%-50% between the two businesses, so, $8 million each.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","$16 million?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","$16 million, Patrick, you said?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","$16 million, yes.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Thanks. Yeah, thanks very much.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Patrick, the Q1 restructuring, will that run through Commercial Systems?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. The restructuring charge itself, we'll treat as outside of segment operating earnings. That's what we typically do.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just a question on the pre-production, I think a while back you had a chart that showed pre-production coming down a fair amount in 2016 and looks like it's not going to come down as much now. Can you talk about what the additional spending is going towards?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it's coming down about $40 million year-over-year. I'm trying to remember the chart you're talking about. I suspect there is incremental spending, largely on things like the CSeries and Globals, because both of those programs have been delayed.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. The chart you had, I think, this from your Investor Day, whenever you had your last one and looked like the spend was around $100 million, and the now spend, ex-amortization, looks like it's around $150 million. Is that right?","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I was thinking more like $140 million. But, yeah, I do think the vast majority of the additional spend is related to those Bombardier programs.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on government, the JTRS Manpack program, I think is set for an award in the January or February timeframe. Do you guys have a sense of how many awardees they are going to be, and would a win positively impact your fiscal 2016? And then, just I was wondering if there are any other meaningful competitive opportunities on the government side that we should look out for.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, that one is a very meaningful competition for us, but not for 2016. They are going to select multiple suppliers. By the way, the proposals have been submitted, so they're in the source selection process right now. They'll select multiple suppliers, two or three has been the indication that we have. That somewhat is dependent on the compliance level of the proposals that go in. But part of that program includes once you're selected, you provide prototype radios to the Army and then they go through a test and evaluation program before they turn around and buy quantities of radios, so all the revenues will be outside of our fiscal 2016.","In terms of other big programs in Government Systems, we got quite a few international C-130 update programs that should come to source selection here in the next six months, so that a space to watch, because we are anticipating some of that will drive growth for us in the second half.","And then, we have just the significant quantity of smaller level programs. I will say it was nice to get both the ARC-210 and the MIDS IDIQs in place so that we can get the annual buys bought against those. And again, those are \u2013 our 210's going to drive some growth for us as well as the data link. The MIDS is a data link. That will drive some growth for us in 2016 as well. We've got the base contract, but we need to get the annual buys then in place against those base contracts.","We're also seeing some uptick in GPS, modernized GPS awards. And so that's another space to watch over the year, because I am anticipating some pretty good growth in that area as well.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Well, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, again. I just wanted to ask about 757, 767 cockpit retrofit, and what the activity level has been there.","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we had good growth last year with some launch customers. We're working a couple of campaigns right now, nothing yet that I can announce, but we are expecting to continue to also see growth in 2016 with that large-format display retrofit program.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, thanks for the follow up, guys. Kelly, in your prepared remarks, you talked about you're making some investments for new opportunities in Defense, right. So, that kind of begs the question, if you can answer it, does long range strike bomber benefit you guys or not? And then, what other future opportunities are you investing in?","Robert K. Ortberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, no comment on the first program. Obviously, the JTRS program, which we've got to bring pretty much a non-development item radio to the table, so that's quite an investment. And then, we're continuing to always invest in next-generation capability, particularly as we're bringing commercial flight decks into the military market. So, for example, some of the rotary wing applications that I talked about, typically what we need to do is bring fusion components, but militarize those. And we'll spend R&D doing that militarization work, so that we can be competitive in bringing those commercial technologies into that military market.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great.

Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the follow up. The question is in 2016, if you can comment on Commercial Systems growth, it looks organically like maybe it's flat. Ex-Bombardier, what would the growth look like? And number two, pro forma for 2016, how much of your revenue is Bombardier at this point? Thanks.","Patrick Allen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would say, ex-Bombardier, we're talking about mid-single digit growth for Commercial Systems on an organic basis.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Lindsey and good morning to all of you on the call. With me on the line this morning are Rockwell Collins\u2019 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Allen. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and you can view the slides we will be presenting today on our website at www.rockwellcollins.com under the Investor Relations tab.

These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Thanks, Ryan and good morning everyone. Well, as you know this has been a very busy quarter for us with the announcement of the B\/E acquisition last October. And I am very pleased to say that we certainly weren\u2019t distracted when it comes to performance on our core business. This was a very good operational quarter with total segment operating margins increasing 90 basis points over the prior year. Our earnings per share increased 10% and that includes fuel costs, so if you strip those out along with the restructuring charge and the benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credits in the first quarter last year, we actually say a 17% earnings per share improvement year-on-year.","Now, we knew we had some challenging sales mix issues, particularly in our commercial business and we took some strong cost management actions and those played through really in all of our businesses. From a sales perspective, the first quarter came in pretty much as we expected. Let me start with our Government Systems business. I am pleased to report our third straight quarter of growth as we pull out of the defense cycle. We are clearly on a path to achieve our objective of getting our Government Systems business back to a solid mid single-digit growth business. And in spite of operating the quarter under a continuing resolution we are seeing more and more business opportunities. Our team is very busy on bid and proposal activities, which is a great place to be right now. In our commercial business our sales were down slightly in the quarter and as we have signaled we anticipate our commercial business to be down just a little in the first half with recovery in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s when we expect to see improved mandate comparables and the 737 MAX revenues ramping up. Biz jet demand continues to be a challenge for us, but our team is doing a nice job of filling some of that shortfall with additional customer funded engineering sales.","Moving now to our information management services business, we posted 8% sales coupled with 240 basis points of margin improvement. We saw our aviation related sales increase double digits and that delivered nice incremental margins. And we continue to lay the ground work for future growth in this business. For example, in 2016, last year, we saw 100% renewal rate for subscribers on our ARINC Global Link service. We are also making inroads in our cabin connectivity market. And we had a big with Norwegian Air Shuttle where we will be bringing a true end-to-end integrated digital solution spanning onboard equipment, the certification of the system and then the connectivity service. This is exactly the type of synergy we envisioned when we acquired ARINC and there are more opportunities like this in our pursuit pipeline. We are also continuing to build on our airports offering with acquisition of Pulse.Aero this quarter. They specialize in self bag drop applications and self bag drop is becoming a very important step to streamlining the passenger flow through airports. And where it\u2019s being implemented, it\u2019s delivering impressive results to the airlines, so a real nice quarter for our core business.","Now, let me give you an update on the B\/E acquisition. From a regulatory perspective we cleared the HSR waiting period, so regulatory approval in the U.S. is behind us. We also have regulatory filings in Europe, China, South Korea, Turkey and the Philippines. And we continue to believe that we will obtain all the approvals from these filings that will allow us to close yet this spring. From a share owner vote perspective, we filed an amended S4 on January 10 and hope to go effective and convene our special shareholder meeting in the very near future. We have been actively meeting with investors since we announced the deal in October and people are getting comfortable with the benefits of bringing these two great companies together.","We are also making really good progress on our integration planning activities. First of all, we have our integration team identified and in place and they are actively working the integration planning activities so that we hit the ground running post-close. This includes further detailed planning around the cost and revenue synergy capture and recall that we had projected $160 million of run rate cost synergies and I remain confident in our ability to achieve these. We are also beginning planning on what I will call our Phase 2 synergies. These are potentially incremental to our baseline plan and there are areas where we have potential redundancy and overlap between our businesses and we are now beginning to work through the details to quantify those savings.","As for revenue synergies, just remember that we didn\u2019t include these in our business case, but that didn\u2019t mean that we are not working these opportunities to create upside opportunities. We obviously can\u2019t go too far in our channel leverage until we combine, but I am encouraged with the opportunities that are being explored, in particular, B\/E really does have some nice capabilities that we think we could further prosecute in our government channel. And there is good reason to expect that we will be able to bring these to reality and create meaningful long-term revenues for our company. So everything is moving full speed ahead and we believe we are on course for shareholder approval in early March and we should be able to then close soon after we get those regulatory approvals.","So with that, let me turn it over to Patrick and have him walk us through the details of the quarter.","Patrick Allen","Thanks Kelly. Good morning to everyone as well. I would like to know walk you through today\u2019s presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of 2017. I will begin on Slide 3 where we highlighted total company first quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and operating cash flow. Total company sales for the quarter increased $24 million or 2% compared to the first quarter of last year due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales, partially offset by lower Commercial Systems sales. Income from continuing operations increased $12 million or 9% and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.10 or 10% compared to the same period last year.","Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017, includes $0.10 of deal costs related to the pending acquisition of B\/E Aerospace. Earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2016 includes a $0.21 restructuring and asset impairment charge partially offset by an $0.18 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal Research & Development Tax Credit. And if we exclude all of those items, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.20 compared to $1.30 in the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and 90 basis points of higher total segment operating margins.","As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $549 million in the first quarter, down 2% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs increased $5 million or 2% to $318 million, primarily due to higher product deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Bombardier CSeries production rate increases, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment and higher customer funded development program revenues, all of which was partially offset by lower business aircraft OEM production rates.","Now aftermarket sales decreased $13 million or 5% due to lower regulatory mandate sales, lower spares provisioning and lower head-up display retrofit sales to customers in China. Commercial Systems operating margins were flat at $125 million and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 22.8%. The improvement in operating margin was due to lower research and development expense and the cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower sales and the sales mix as lower margin customer funded development revenues increased and higher margin business jet OEMs sales decreased.","Moving on to Slide 5, Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $475 million, driven by higher simulation training program revenues, higher fixed-wing platform revenues and higher datalink program sales, all of which was partially offset by lower communications revenues. Government Systems first quarter operating earnings increased $10 million to $96 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.2%, 110 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. The increased operating earnings and operating margin were due to higher sales volume and our cost savings initiatives.","Turning to Slide 6, Information Management Services sales increased 8% over the prior year as aviation related sales increased double digits. Non-aviation sales increased 2% over the prior year. Information Management Services first quarter operating earnings increased $6 million to $30 million, resulting in operating margin of 17.8% compared to 15.4% in the first quarter last year. The 240 basis point increase in operating margin was due to incremental earnings and the higher sales volume and favorable sales mix.","Moving to Slide 7, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first three months of fiscal year 2017, our debt to EBITDA ratio has remained relatively flat with the year end at 1.7. Slide 8 provides some additional color about our anticipated near-term capital deployment in light of the pending B\/E acquisition. As always, we will invest in organic growth. We will continue to invest in R&D and our capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales. We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to de-lever over the next few years. At the time of the acquisition of B\/E Aerospace closes, we anticipate our debt to EBITDA will be a little bit over 4. We expect our debt to EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within 2 years. And we will remain focused on shareholder return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes in the range of 2x to 2.5x debt to EBITDA, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. We are committed to maintain strong liquidity and flexibility and presuming our solid investment grade credit rating.","Now on to Slide 9 where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2017 financial guidance, please note, this guidance is just for Rockwell Collins\u2019 base business and does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of B\/E Aerospace. We will update our combined guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing of the close. With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This reflects Government System sales growing low to mid single-digits, accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat as benefits from market share gains near transport offset further declines in business jet OEM revenues. In the first half of fiscal 2017, we expect Commercial Systems sales to be down low single-digits due to headwinds in business jet sales and difficult comps in the aftermarket. Over the second half of the year, we expect Commercial Systems sales to increase low single-digits as air transport production rates increase, new products enter into service and ADS mandate revenues begin to accelerate.","And finally, we expect Information Management Services to be up mid to high single-digits in fiscal 2017. Total segment operating margins are expected to be approximately 21%, cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $800 million and $900 million and CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, all of which results from free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to be between $900 million and $950 million and our full year income tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 28% to 29%.","That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session.","Ryan Miller","Thank you, Patrick. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one per caller. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those additional questions if time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning Rob.","Robert Stallard","I would always start off by talking about the business jet aftermarket, you mentioned about mandates, so wondering if you could talk about some of the aspects of the biz jet aftermarket, what sort of growth rates you saw in discretionary and non-discretionary and what the level of interest is at the moment?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. So let me just close out on the mandates, Rob. So last year, we saw really good revenue associated with the TCAS mandate. That\u2019s going to be a headwind for us in the first quarter of this year or the first half of this year and we saw that in the first quarter. And then we have got the ADS-B mandate coming in, which will be a tailwind for us as we entered the second half. So we got just a little bit of a timing relative to the mandate side. The discretionary side is about the same as what we saw the second half of last year, which is pretty good upgrades on avionics. That\u2019s actually selling better than our cabin upgrades right now, which is a little bit of a reversal for may be a year ago where we are seeing more cabin upgrades and less avionics upgrades. And I think it reflects the fact that there is kind of a fixed budget that they are putting into the aircraft and some of these avionics upgrades I think are recognized as necessary to continue to sustain the airplane or to actually turn the airplane if they are planning to sell it. So sustained aftermarket, that continues to be pretty good for us.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the government side, the change in administration is coming through here, has that had any impact on order intake or usual business with the DoD?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, as I have said in my prepared remarks, we are really busy right now, there are a lot more programs, a lot more program opportunities and the scope of the programs are larger. And that\u2019s under continuing resolution where everybody normally is kind of slow at moving on new business. So I am encouraged \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything specific to the new administration, but they are certainly more focused on growing the defense business. And I feel really good about the opportunities and where we are seeing these programs come up that we are going to be able to, as I said, get this business back to mid single-digit strong growth business for us.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thanks Kelly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Myles.","Myles Walton","Patrick, could I start on the margins side, obviously pretty strong margins here in the first quarter, some good help on timing of R&D, but that being said, I don\u2019t think you have had first quarter margins do anything other than ramp through the course of the year in previous years, so is it purely timing that is going to hold back the margin expansion on higher volumes as we press through the year or can you give us more color?","Patrick Allen","I would tell you Myles, I think we started with stronger margins than I anticipated in the first quarter. So I think there is some timing on R&D, particularly on the commercial side of the business. You are absolutely right, there is going to be a shift between our deferred spending and company funded spending. But I also think that \u2013 it signals, maybe there is a little opportunity in the margin side for the balance of the year.","Myles Walton","Okay. And then Kelly, can you guys make a comment on jitters and the timing that you are kind of considering there and looking forward through the course of fiscal \u201817?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. The program continues to move forward. We completed, I think all the suppliers completed the first phase testing. And we have received the incremental order for the additional radios that will be utilized in the second phase of testing. And in fact, we are delivering those radios right now. We are still expecting a delivery order decision yet this year, probably in the third to fourth quarter of our fiscal year. And again, that\u2019s where they will potentially down select from three current suppliers to two suppliers and make a pretty large annual buy. So we still have the test phase. The second phase of testing ahead of us and we need to get through that and then hopefully we are successful in the down selection.","Myles Walton","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Rob.","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Patrick, this is going to come up at some point, it\u2019s a little bit early, but could you give us some sense of your expectation or an early read on some of these Trump reign [ph] potential accounting adjustments, tax rate, interest deductibility, depreciation, etcetera, border adjustment?","Patrick Allen","Yes. Rob, as I read and I think it\u2019s a net positive for us. Obviously, the rate reduction is a big component of it. But the fact that I think both proposals call for the preservation of the R&D tax credit, I think is really good news for us. There is the elimination of the Section 199, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction, which would be an offset slightly. But it also say that this border adjusted tax, as I understand it, is a net favorable for \u2013 certainly for legacy Rockwell Collins, a little bit less so for B\/E, because they have got more offshore manufacturing. But I think if I balance it all out, I could see our rate coming down close to 20%.","Robert Spingarn","And then just quickly for Kelly, any sense \u2013 you have talked about business jet headwinds so far throughout the morning, but any sense that that\u2019s starting to turn?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, let\u2019s just say it hasn\u2019t gotten worse. I don\u2019t know that I can say it\u2019s starting to turn and I am probably going to stay a little bit pessimistic until I see some real signs of that. Having said that, all of our OEM customers are generally reporting a pretty good fourth quarter, calendar year fourth quarter, which is different than what we saw last year. We did not see a big true-up here with significant rate reductions this year. We didn\u2019t see rate increases, but we didn\u2019t see the rate reductions. So maybe stabilization is the best way to describe that. Back to the question around the new administration, I am very hopeful that anything that stimulates economic growth and tax policies that focus on boosting capital spending is going to have some juice into the business aviation marketplace and that will probably be the first place we would see that. So I am hopeful that, that all comes to fruition here today marks a big day.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Hi, good morning. And just I wanted to extend my condolences on the loss of your colleague. We really enjoyed working with Ellen, so apologies for you guys. I wanted to ask a couple of clarifying, just sort of little ones on Commercial Systems, Patrick, can you give us a sense of the BRS OE sales, what those might have been down if you didn\u2019t have the CSeries growth and if that sort of implies that there was another de-stock like you saw last year. And then on the cost savings, it looks like maybe implied those are sort of mid single-digits millions, is that a decent number or too high? Thanks.","Patrick Allen","Yes. Carter, I would say this, if we strip out the regional jet, which was favorably impacted by the CSeries, Bizjet was down over 20% for the quarter, which was a combination of de-stocking as well as kind of the play out of the rate reductions we saw last year. In terms of the savings, I think you got it about right, mid single-digits in the millions for the quarter.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. I will get back in the queue.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the business jets Kelly, I mean you have said that you needed faster GDP growth, we seem to be getting that, you said we needed better business confidence, we seem to be getting that. And then one specific, if I look sequentially, business jet aftermarket, while up minimally, was actually up slightly Q4 to Q1, which hasn\u2019t occurred in a lot of years, I have records back at least 5 years, so is there anything to those issues suggesting that maybe as the year goes on, you get a little bit more positive?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. I think those are all really positive indicators, George. And I am hopeful that we will see that. I think it\u2019s going to take a while before that actually converts into OEM rate increases, but certainly we are see it first in more activity in the aftermarket. I think we have got a good set of aftermarket solutions to prosecute that opportunity if it presents itself. So yes hopefully, we will see that improved from our current outlook. Like I said, I am just kind of waiting to see the actual numbers because we have seen some glimmer before, that\u2019s kind of faded away and I just want to make sure it\u2019s systemic here.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then one quick follow-up for Patrick, Patrick, government incremental margin was like 42% and 46% in IMS, are those sustainable kinds of numbers or you are just getting an inordinate amount of cost benefit this quarter?","Patrick Allen","Well, George, I would say that certainly we are going to continue to see good incremental margins and we should see the cost savings continue to play through the margins over the course of the year. I would say both Government Systems and IMS benefited from mix. And so whether the margin, the incremental margins are as rich as they are in the first quarter, I doubt they will be for the balance of the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Patrick, just a quick one for you on the preproduction engineering cost in the cash flow statement on gross basis that says it was $38 million and yet the net amount, it looks like, was a zero, so was there \u2013 what kind of offset that $38 million, since it\u2019s higher than usual amortization rate?","Patrick Allen","Well, if I take it down, we have $38 million of spend, about $11 million of amortization and then there was a reclassification of the remaining $27 million. That\u2019s how you get down to flat.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter Keay","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Kelly, did you give a consideration to a scenario of the Zodiac turnaround, VN acquisition when you laid out the scenarios of some of your revenue synergy assumptions and are you expecting now a more challenging competitor, particularly as it relates to some of the contract wins that B\/E has seen over the last few years?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, yes, our baseline assumption was that Zodiac\u2019s performance would recover and we have to expect that and we are going to plan for that. If you are talking relative to the announcement yesterday, that\u2019s something that\u2019s been rumored for quite some time, long before the \u2013 our B\/E move. So it\u2019s certainly something we contemplated as we went through that. Look, we don\u2019t \u2013 we really don\u2019t compete much with Saffron [ph] in our core markets today. So I don\u2019t really see that combination having any dramatic impact on our plans. Obviously, they are going to be a bigger, larger company and that will create some both positive and negative potential dynamics. But we deal with that every day in our core markets. So I think full speed ahead for us. This isn\u2019t something that derails our strategy, something we certainly thought about before we made the B\/E decision.","Hunter Keay","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein","Since your last or I guess since October when you provided guidance, Boeing has announced the 777 \u2013 another 777 rate cut, can just talk about how that might play out for you, I don\u2019t know that would affect \u201817 in either way, but how does that affect your outlook?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. We had anticipated rate cuts Sam, on the 777. It did come a little earlier than we expected. So we are going to see some impact to our fiscal \u201817 commercial plan from the baseline, but it\u2019s not overly material and it\u2019s something that we think that is kind of within the R&O profile of the business.","Patrick Allen","Okay. And then if you look forward, we had that rate reduction baked into our longer-term outlook.","Sam Pearlstein","And I was going to ask about that longer-term outlook, so when you ask for, you have a pretty strong multiyear outlook in there for the base business and when you have talked about the double-digit accretion into \u201818, is that a reasonable baseline to be thinking about at least in the \u201818 timeframe?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, yes, I think that\u2019s our baseline plan as of record. Just recognize that, that plan was put together last February timeframe. We will update that. I think there is puts and takes, but I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to look at. We might be a little sporty on the revenue side of the equation, but we think we are probably offsetting conservative on the bottom line side of that. So I think if you are looking at the top line, maybe a little bit \u2013 that might be a little bit sporty, bottom line should be good.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Kelly, I wanted to come back to your prepared remarks, you talked about looking at Phase 2 synergies, can you just provide some color on the size of those synergies and the timeline. And then just relating to the B\/E transaction, as you have done your work, or more work rather, over the last few months, what stood out to you as a customer relationships, products, operations, just any thoughts there?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, we are still quantifying those costs. And they are all related to where we have overlap, either in capability manufacturing sites, where we are doing duplicate things, customer support sites, where we may have multiple facilities. I am not going to size that yet, because our teams are working right now to figure that out and in fact the timing of that as well. The area that I am and I made this comment in the prepared remarks, that I am incrementally more encouraged is around our government channel. And let me walk through an example of that to help you kind of think about that. The tanker transport market is a big market for us, important market for our core business. And we really address that market with five major product line \u2013 product portfolios. Our avionics, as you know, displays, head up, head down displays, commercial COMM\/NAV surveillance, military flight management kind of capability. The second thing \u2013 second area is in electromechanical systems, horizontal trim actuator, pilot controls, throttle quadrants. The third area we address, third product portfolio is in military COMM\/NAV, secure frequency hopping radios, tactical data links, [indiscernible] on radio navigation functions for the military. And then the fourth area is mission systems. Things like the air refueling that we are doing on the KC-46, command and control platforms like what we are doing on the E6, cargo handling like we are doing on the KC-390. And then the fourth area of our portfolio is around simulation \u2013 the fifth area, simulation and training and this actually is an equipment on the aircraft, but it\u2019s procured as a part of these mods and upgrades or new aircraft programs, visual systems, image generators, maintenance and flight trainers. And we bring that whole portfolio of capability together to address the opportunities that are in that market. And if you step back from that, interesting enough, a lot of that has came from inorganic moves that we have made. Our head-up displays, all come through our Flight Dynamics acquisition. All of our electromechanical portfolio comes through Kaiser electrodeposition acquisition. All of our simulation and trainings come through the acquisition of NLX and SEOS. And so that\u2019s what we are going to do with the B\/E portfolio. And as you look at that, I am encouraged because there are some really nice capabilities. Flight deck controls, they do overhead panels, which we don\u2019t do. They do that, for example, in CH-47. Cooling systems, avionics coolers, you think of them as doing the chillers for the food and beverage preparation, but they also do use that technology for avionics bay coolers. Data recorders from their macrolink business on the Global Hawk and PA where they are doing acoustic and secure data recording. The lighting and power coming out of the Amtec business, cockpit lights, cabin lights, exterior lights, oxygen systems for pilot and crew oxygen and they are doing that on Eurofighter 8400M, the KC-390. And then pilot and crew seating, troop seats, optionally armored seats, pilot seats. They are doing that on helicopter programs for both Airbus and Leonardo. And if I look at that portfolio of new capability, in many cases, they are kind of below the center of mass for their organization. Everybody is off pursuing these things on a one-off basis. And we are going to do just what we have done with the flight dynamics to where it has become a core part of our product offering and bring these capabilities together. So that\u2019s what I talk \u2013 when I talk about leverage in the channel, there is great opportunities for us to do that. And I could walk through missiles and ammunitions example or rotary wing example where we will do the same thing. We have got our teams together right now, working on what those opportunities are. I even had \u2013 already had a case where military customers asking us to bid some interior work before we have even had the calls where we just have to subcontract the B\/E. So we really \u2013 I do really believe we are going to be able to create these synergies. Now, if you think about them and I use IMS as an example, we just got this big Norwegian deal with IMS, took us about 3 years to get that all pulled together. We got sometimes develop equipment, get people together, bid programs, win the program, that takes time. And I think that can take some time here on exploiting the government channel. But what I like is if we can get through this, we will get all these upfront synergies that are straightforward for us to do in the first as we do the integration. And right when we got those humming and we have got the business integrated, we will start to see these revenue synergies create long-term meaningful opportunities. And we will be able to grow some more in the defense business as well. So again, I feel incrementally better about our ability to go create those revenue synergies. We are not committed to them, so they all become upside to our basic business plan.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for the color, Kelly.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Thanks. Good morning Kelly and Patrick.","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Kelly, maybe you can stick with defense, maybe just give us your updated thoughts on the impact of the CR, I know you had given some commentary that from win through March which is going to hurt your bookings, but it lingers past there, we will start to see some further impact on maybe your overall plan. And then just related to that, just there is a lot of talk about an increase in readiness spending and improving like the simulation training business, I think about your installed base of parts, what\u2019s your thoughts on how a pickup in the O&M and how that would impact you?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, let me address the CR first. We have gone through our plan in detail around the CR. We have actually seen a little bit of impact for programs that we know are going to be delayed relative to the CR, but we have had enough opportunities as well to kind of hold that and offset that. I remain with the same position if the CR gets cleared here, I think will be okay for our fiscal \u201817 revenues. If they extend the CR even another month, it\u2019s going to probably start to eat into our forecast and you can kind of think of that every month that increases in terms of an impact going forward. Now, everybody is focused on clearing the CR. I expect that\u2019s going to happen but that is a risk that still remains out there for our government business.","Peter Arment","And regarding the readiness spending?","Kelly Ortberg","Regarding readiness, well, we don\u2019t \u2013 we probably don\u2019t see as much near-term impact from readiness. Obviously, they are flying aircraft more hours, we may see more maintenance activity. If they are buying more spares and more equipment, I am not expecting that readiness improvements going to have any meaningful impact at least for us here in fiscal \u201817.","Peter Arment","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So a question about your customer Bombardier, are you seeing any impact on your deliveries to CSeries as a result of the engine delays. Secondly, how do you feel about how they are doing on the Global 7000 in terms of getting their certification. And then lastly, have they paid you, I think they owe you $25 million or $30 million as a result of the cancellation of the Lear 85? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Let me address the Lear85 first and kind of go \u2013 walk back on your three questions. So we, Rockwell Collins and Bombardier, without admission of liability, have reached an amicable resolution in relations to the Lear 85 program. The details of that are confidential and so we are going to be providing any further detail around the details of that. I will just say our relationship with Bombardier is very good and we are glad to have this behind us and both focused on executing the business at hand. We have not seen any impact to our CSeries ramp, to your question about any other issues driving that. So no, we have not seen that any recent impact there. And the Global 7000 continues to move forward on schedule. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I also don\u2019t see any impact for the certification. Now, we only see what we see. But having said that, both those programs appear to be moving forward in a good fashion.","Cai Von Rumohr","And then they said that their Challengers and Global deliveries will be flat in 2017 and yet your business is down, does that reflect the fact that you are shipping to them at a substantially lower rate than they are shipping out the door?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. We were ahead of them last year and that\u2019s this inventory rationalization that we are going through. So yes, that\u2019s the result of delivering too much last year for their deliveries.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.","Peter Skibitski","Good morning guys. I guess the only thing I would ask Kelly, is we would just like to get your thoughts on the commercial aerospace cycle, we have seen some wide-body headwinds, but still pretty large backlog on the narrow-body side, so just was wondering how you are thinking about it and what your some of your airline customers are saying?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, look, I think we are 3 years into the order cycle. I think we peaked back in \u201813 and \u201814 and we are seeing that right now. Obviously, it\u2019s having different impacts on narrow-body and wide-body. And the real question is how long is the order cycle last and how does that convert to delivery cycle. And everybody knows that the last delivery cycle \u2013 or last order cycle didn\u2019t convert into an overall delivery cycle because of the very strong backlogs. My feeling is the same is going to happen. I don\u2019t think we are going to come out of the order cycle for a few more years. I think we will see that probably coincide with the 777X coming into the marketplace. I think narrow-bodies are fine. We are going to continue to see the narrow-body because of the strong backlog, continue to ramp up at both OEMs. But I do think we are going to see continued softness for the legacy wide-bodies and we have seen that already, the 777 legacy aircraft, A380 and the 747-8. So I think that\u2019s going to continue to be a challenge and we will probably continue to see higher levels of retirements of the legacy wide-body aircraft as well until we start to see the order environment up-tick.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. And then just on some pressure on airline profits this year, are you seeing any kind of slowing of fee type orders or anything like that related to the kind of slowing of their financial position?","Kelly Ortberg","Not really. I mean they have to go make those BFE orders to take the airplane. So I think that\u2019s going \u2013 we are seeing the impact. If they are going to delay delivery of A380s, our equipment on A380s are going to delay with that change. So any kind of deferrals will flow through our particular business. But I am not seeing anything yet that indicates we have got a large by wave of either deferrals, cancellations or reschedules coming. Having said that, I suspect we will have some of that here over the next couple of years until we come out of the order cycle.","Peter Skibitski","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning David.","David Strauss","Wanted to follow up on \u2013 someone asked a question on the S4, Kelly you said the revenue outlook included in that might be a little bit robust, but compensated on the margins side and the bottom line, what about free cash flow, it doesn\u2019t seem like what you are implying in there gets you above 100% free cash flow conversion out over the next couple of years, which is a bit surprising to me?","Patrick Allen","I would say we are probably pretty conservative on the cash flow side as well. I would have to go back and take a look at it. But these were plans put together, really for a purpose other than providing financial guidance. They are really a strategic and financial planning item. So I would say we are probably conservative both on the EBIT side and on the free cash flow side.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. But just to be clear, we are absolutely committed and have a plan for the combined entity cash flow and achieving that 100% cash conversion. So that is our plan, we are confident being able to achieve that?","David Strauss","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you comment on the 777 rate cut, you have had that kind of factored in, but it did come a little bit earlier than expected, how are you thinking about that 777 rate cut in relation to the B\/E business and the plan there? Thanks.","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. If you look at near term, the way has forecasted their outlook or their business, it\u2019s really much more of a backlog based analysis than what we do, which is more rule out rate analysis. So if the rates reduce because, what I will say, whitetails or aircraft that aren\u2019t filling in that demand, really doesn\u2019t have any impact to B\/E\u2019s near-term outlook. What does have impact is where you see shifting of the backlog. So Emirates, for example, with the A380, that\u2019s an area which would move the revenues associated with that to the time that they move those deliveries. So I am not expecting significant impact associated with that 777 rate reductions unless we see significant rescheduling of existing backlog.","David Strauss","Alright. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. While everybody is focusing on the big deal, I noticed Pulse is probably $11 million transaction and while that\u2019s probably small, Kelly, could you talk a little bit about how you see this as an opportunity to expand IMS and what kind of revenue potential is related to that and are there some other things you can...?","Kelly Ortberg","I am sorry, go ahead, finish your question.","Howard Rubel","Well, I was going to say it probably gives you a further systems orientation in terms of how you are able to kind of greet the customer at the front of the airport and shepherd him through the whole process, do you have a vision for that as well?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. If you look at our overall airport business, it\u2019s all around providing improved flow-through the airport from walking in to boarding the aircraft. So self-service kiosk, all the ticketing self-service is a big focus in our airport business today. And the self-serve backdrop is going to be a big driver here over the next 5 years. If you haven\u2019t used it yet, you will be using it and you will see that just like the self-service ticket kiosk, it really is a much better way to move folks through the airport. And so we thought \u2013 we saw this as a key element of driving airport upgrades. It\u2019s a part of a portfolio for us to do that. We felt we wanted to have that because they have got some Pulse.Aero has some differentiating technology that we think will improve our win on these airport upgrade opportunities for us going forward. So yes, that is our vision, is to be able to use information, connectivity, getting through the passport control, getting through ticketing and baggage handling. And it\u2019s all around managing that and that goes all the way to the aircraft. There will be a day where you will be able to track your bag from the seat in the aircraft throughout the mission of the flight.","Howard Rubel","And then as a follow-up, BFE is an important part of your business and while the revenue is down, could you address a little bit about some of the other elements inside the cockpit, I mean you talked about the China Eastern win and is there some further market share opportunities and in fact, it does look like you are taking share, is that fair?","Kelly Ortberg","So let me clear the HUD issue right now. So last \u2013 the HUDs that were down this quarter is in the retrofits of HUDs, not HUDs with new aircraft delivery. And the reason that\u2019s down is that Chinese government has had an incentive plan in place where they are providing financial incentives to the airlines to retrofit their fleet with a head-up display. That incentive pool last year depleted. And it was depleted for about a little over a quarter, where we do that, they were going to put some additional funds in that and the airlines knew that, but everybody just stopped ordering retrofit HUDs while that incentive was not available to them. That incentive is now back in place and we are seeing orders. So we continue to believe that the HUD retrofit market is going to be good for us, particularly in China. Relative to other retrofits, I would say there is not much going on other than mandates. The ADS-B, the TCAS update that we had, those will be nice, but there is not much other retrofit activity. BFE competitions, we continued to do well. I believe we are gaining share, but we are at a relatively high share ratio as well. So we are going to continue to be focused on that strong BFE business. And we are pleased that the airlines are selecting our equipment for their new aircraft deliveries.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Kelly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Ciarmoli","Maybe Kelly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been brought up yet, commercial aftermarket, looks like it was the biggest rate of decline, down 7.5%, I mean is that performing as expected, I know you guys thought it was going to be weak, is it getting worse, you mentioned possibly more legacy wide-bodies, I would imagine that would further hit the recycling market, but any additional color there, I mean is that getting worse for you or is it sort of stabilized or just some comments on that?","Kelly Ortberg","Yes. The market \u2013 the aftermarket was not strong this first quarter, but that would then come as a surprise to us and we talked about the mandate timing both in biz jet and air transport. The one thing that we haven\u2019t said, that maybe is a little bit of new information is in the used parts area. We were down in our enter trade business in the first quarter. That\u2019s been a growth area for us as we have seen a lot of this recycling going on in the past couple of years. I am not expecting to see much growth out of our enter trade business this year. A lot of people have jumped into that segment and the whole trick here is having a balance of supply and demand, making sure you don\u2019t pay too much for the used parts or you don\u2019t buy a bunch of used parts that there is excess in the market you can\u2019t turn. So I have said we are going to stay disciplined in this segment and we are. Having said that, I think the market may be losing a little bit of discipline. So I don\u2019t think we are going to see that driving a lot of growth for us. We are going to stay there because I really like the visibility it gives to what\u2019s going on in the aftermarket relative to used components. But again, I don\u2019t see it as a growth driver for us for this fiscal year.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Ken Herbert","Hi, good morning.","Kelly Ortberg","Good morning.","Patrick Allen","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","Just wanted to follow-up Patrick, quickly on the commercial transport aftermarket, if you back out the headwinds from initial provisioning and I think you said both 787-A and A350, fair to say you were down just low single-digits, is that the right magnitude of the impact there?","Patrick Allen","That\u2019s pretty close.","Ken Herbert","Okay. And then on that \u2013 I am sorry.","Patrick Allen","It\u2019s a low to mid single-digit. Yes.","Ken Herbert","Yes. Okay, perfect. And on the provisioning, obviously Airbus ended the year I think stronger than we all expected with the A350 deliveries, can you talk about maybe as we move into the second half of this year or when you expect to see that become perhaps more of a meaningful contributor and when do the 787 initial provisioning comps start to get a little easier?","Kelly Ortberg","Well, on 787, we are really starting to enter into a normal provisioning cycle. And I mean there will be a little bit of lumpiness. But even the sparing that we were down in the first quarter wasn\u2019t large number. So it\u2019s much more of a regular run rate. The provisioning on A350 really goes with the number of new airlines that are taking aircraft. So it\u2019s not necessarily linear to the production rate deliveries, it\u2019s more focused on is there a new type airline taking the deliveries, which means it\u2019s a little bit lumpy. And as we have said, A350 provisioning is not near as big because we aren\u2019t provisioning the cockpit. So we don\u2019t have near as big provisioning as we had say, on 787. Now, we will start to see some provisioning here this year on 737 MAX and that will be a tailwind for us over the next 3 years.","Ken Herbert","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kelly Ortberg","Hi Noah.","Noah Poponak","Just to stay on the aftermarket line of questioning there Patrick, the down low to mid-single you just said, is that \u2013 is that ex provisioning or is that more ex everything that\u2019s lumpy or sort of non-recurring?","Patrick Allen","Well, let me put it this way. I think if you look at total air transport aftermarket, we are expected to be down low single-digits, all in. I think the question that I was answering was if I \u2013 if you look at just the first quarter and look at just taking up the provisioning, we were down probably low to mid single-digits. So think of Commercial Systems in total aftermarket down low single-digits.","Noah Poponak","Is that also \u2013 but in addition to it \u2013 it sounds like in addition to a provisioning lumpiness headwind that also had a mandate lumpiness headwind, a China HUD headwind and an energy headwind, is that correct?","Patrick Allen","That\u2019s true, yes.","Noah Poponak","So I guess I am just trying to get\u2026","Patrick Allen","So if you take out all of those headwinds, we are roughly flat for the quarter.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And maybe that\u2019s too much, the growth excluding everything that\u2019s not growing metric. But I am just trying to better understand like the real core underlying ongoing aftermarket trends?","Patrick Allen","Think of that is being pretty flat, excluding those headwinds, that headwinds you just mentioned.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then how should I think about ex headwind for the full year?","Patrick Allen","I think you are probably roughly flat again.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then CSeries, would you be willing to put any numbers around how big CSeries gets for you in the fiscal \u201817 outlook and\/or how big it can get for Rockwell Collins wanted that rate?","Patrick Allen","Well, look. We have \u2013 we don\u2019t give the actual dollar value per aircraft per fiscal year. We do have 30 ships that\u2019s of deliveries for CSeries baked into our fiscal \u201817 forecast. That will help you.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Can you categorize how the first quarter compared to that 30 for the full year?","Kelly Ortberg","It continues to ramp.","Noah Poponak","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Kelly Ortberg","Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Miller for any closing remarks.","Kelly Ortberg","Before I turn the call back to Ryan, I do want to publicly acknowledge a big loss that we had at Rockwell Collins last week. I think many of you are \u2013 have interacted with Ellen Dennis, who has been our long-standing assistant for our Investor Relations team. And sadly, Ellen passed away last week. So she is one of those people that you love to be around, smart, witty, always trying to make our company better. So we are going to miss her.","Ryan Miller","Thanks Kelly for the acknowledgment, really missing Ellen greatly. And thank you all for joining us in today\u2019s conference call. We plan to file our 10-Q later next week, so please read that document for additional disclosures.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
