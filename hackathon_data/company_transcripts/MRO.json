The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President and COO.","Slide 2 contains the forward-looking statement and other information related to this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and subsequent 8-K cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Please note that in the Appendix for this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2011 and 2012, balance sheet and cash flow information, second quarter and full year 2012 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.","Moving to Slide 3, our first quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $478 million was a 13% decrease over the fourth quarter 2011, largely a result of higher income taxes, as I'll explain on the next slide.","As shown on Slide 4, earnings before tax for the international portion of our E&P segment increased $277 million, while the domestic portion of that segment decreased $30 million, with the Oil Sands Mining and Integrated Gas segments decreasing quarter-over-quarter as well, $26 million and $27 million, respectively.","To help explain the change in our tax position from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and given our present inability to predict activity in Libya with confidence, we've broken the $281 million increase in our consolidated tax expense into 2 categories: one for those income taxes related to the first quarter resumption sales from Libya and one for all other changes in income taxes.","As we often point out, our revenue from Libya is taxed at 93.5%, which resulted in a first quarter tax charge of $203 million. The $78 million increase in income taxes not related to our Libya operations is made up of $125 million for the E&P segment, partially offset by reductions in other segments and a corporate tax benefit for unallocated items.","Approximately 40% of the $125 million increase in income taxes for the E&P segment was a result of a shift to an excess foreign tax credit position. As you may recall, we pointed out this change in the third quarter of last year, as we increased our international price and production forecast for future years. And we had this built into our previous income tax forecast for the full year 2012.","The other 60% of the change is largely a result of our revised expectation for an increase in our higher taxed international jurisdictions as a percentage of 2012 pretax earnings. With this revised expectation in sales mix, we are now projecting an overall effective income tax rate for the full year of 2012, excluding Libya, of between 60% and 65%. Remember, the actual effective income tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the expected annual level of sales by jurisdiction, as well as any discrete items.","On Slide 5, we've included a comparison of the total Upstream Q1 liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, with the estimated liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes for Q2, as an aid in modeling the company's earnings with both periods excluding Libya. The timing of listings can vary based upon nominations yet to be finalized, which can affect the estimated sales volumes, as well as the percentage of contributions.","As shown on Slide 6, the first quarter was a good operating quarter for the E&P segment, with higher sales volumes and better prices compared to the fourth quarter. However, these increases were more than offset by higher segment income tax expense, as I just discussed, and higher DD&A and other expenses on an absolute basis because of increased activity. On a boe basis, E&P costs were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter.","Slide 7 shows that in the U.S., we increased sales volumes quarter-over-quarter reflecting our ongoing development programs, primarily in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Woodford Shale plays. Our U.S. price realizations were negatively impacted by lower domestic natural gas prices and by dislocations in the crude markets, creating wider differentials and lower crude realizations in the Bakken and across the Rocky Mountain region.","After the late January and February widening in differentials, they have returned to more normal levels, narrowing substantially in March and April.  On an absolute basis, DD&A and operating costs were higher in the U.S., reflecting our increased activity in the resource plays.","Slide 8 shows that on a boe basis, the U.S. E&P costs quarter-to-quarter were actually slightly lower, excluding the exploration expense, per boe costs were up $0.77, again, predominantly a reflection of increased activity in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.","Slide 9 shows that our first quarter lower 48 onshore production was 12% higher than the fourth quarter. It also shows we continued to project this portion of our business will grow significantly, reaching between 120,000 and 130,000 boed in the fourth quarter 2012.","Slide 10 shows the positive pretax impact from higher volumes and higher price realizations, which combined, resulted in a 26% increase in international E&P pretax earnings quarter-over-quarter. These positive operating results were more than offset by the previously discussed increase in income taxes.","Slide 11 compares the international E&P cost structure by category over the past 5 quarters. Compared to the fourth quarter, field level controllable costs, DD&A and other costs fell in the first quarter, partially offset by an increase in exploration expense. Total international cost decreased $0.31 per barrel quarter-over-quarter.","As shown on Slide 12, our E&P segment production of available for sale increased 7% quarter-over-quarter, primarily a result of the increased production available for sale in Libya. Sales volumes in the first quarter increased approximately 4% from the fourth quarter. The higher production available for sale compared to actual sales is due to on under lift for the first quarter of 23,000 boed compared to a 10,000 boed under lift in the fourth quarter.","For the first quarter, Europe was under lifted approximately 500,000 boe and Libya was under lifted about 1.7 million boe. The cumulative under lift at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6 million boe: 2.9 million boe underlift in Libya, 2 million boe in Alaska Gas Storage and underlift positions of 750,000 boe in Europe and 400,000 boe in EG.","In April, we entered into agreements to sell all of our Alaska assets. Additionally, we continue to build on our core Eagle Ford holdings, adding 20,000 net acreage through recent and pending acquisitions with current net production of 7,000 boed, nearly all of which is operated. We expect these transactions to close in the second half of the year.","We now expect our capital investment and exploration expenditures budget, excluding acquisition cost, to move up about $200 million from $4.8 billion to $5 billion as a result of adding 2 rigs to our existing fleet of 18 in the Eagle Ford play and other adjustments.","Slide 13 shows the more than 17% growth in our E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. Increased volumes in the most recent 2 quarters were a result of improved reliability in our base business and new wells coming online in our growth assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken.","Slide 14 shows our Oil Sands Mining segment decreased $22 million quarter-over-quarter. This was a result of lower price realizations and higher expenses due to unplanned maintenance, partially offset by changes in DD&A, taxes and other expenses. Net synthetic crude sales were flat quarter-to-quarter at 44,000 barrels per day.","To finish segment reporting, Slide 15 shows that the Integrated Gas segment income decreased $16 million quarter-over-quarter, with this decrease primarily a result of lower Henry Hub-based LNG sales prices and slightly lower LNG sales volumes due to the planned turnaround that began in late March.","Slide 16 provides an analysis of cash flows for the first quarter 2012. Operating cash flow, before changes in working capital, was $1 billion, while working capital changes from operations resulted in a $76 million use of cash. ","Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $1 billion, proceeds from dispositions totaled $208 million and dividends paid totaled $120 million.","During the first quarter of 2012, there was an approximate $150 million U.S. tax payment related to the inclusion of the Downstream business in our 2011 tax return. The quarter end cash balance was approximately $500 million.","As shown on Slide 17, at the end of the first quarter 2012, our cash adjusted debt-to-total-capital ratio remained at 20%.","We will now open the call up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of quick ones, hopefully. On the operational questions, I guess, if Dave's on the call, the Bakken and Eagle Ford well results, Dave, look a fair bit better than perhaps your underlying guidance had previously reflected. So I'm curious on whose areas. Are you now ready to basically change your type curve on, specifically on the Eagle Ford? 1,650 barrels per a day, I think, was the condensate window that you had originally targeted. Are those numbers still good?  And how many -- if you could talk a little bit about how much activity you've actually had in the condensate window to write that out, that'd be great.","David E. Roberts","Okay. Sounds like several questions. I'll see if I can get to them all, Doug. First off all on the Bakken, we're going to stick with where we are. We're pretty much consistently on where we said we were going to be type curve-wise with the 30-stage fracs in the core area of the field. As we start getting results from the Diomedes area, which is the Western area of the field, which won't occur until later this month when we actually get some pump equipment out there, we'll take another look at those. Now with respect to Eagle Ford, a lot of chatter about -- from wells that we put out there and some of our partners had put out there. And what we can say is that the high GOR area is generally exceeding our type curve expectations. We have not yet shifted our curves up. We are seeing some variability across the play. There are some areas that are a little bit lower. In majority, the wells are behaving better. And these are in areas that, although we classify them as the high GOR areas, typically are falling at the low end of those GOR boundaries, 500 to 1,000. From an activity perspective, in the first quarter, we would have added approximately 20 to 25 wells, and all of them would have been in the high-GOR areas. So all of our activity was essentially in that area. And so what we've been able to do since then, in terms of our Q2 expectations is, again, we're largely still focused on the high-GOR area. But importantly, our cadence has improved markedly. I would expect that we would be able to double the number of wells that we are going to add to our portfolio in the second quarter. And of that number, 25% are going to be in the condensate area. We are currently running 6 rigs in the condensate area, so we should start seeing some results from that area very quickly. But based on the fact that the high-GOR wells are performing at or better than expectations, I have no reason to doubt that our type curves for the condensate wells are going to perform as well. And so we're looking forward to seeing those results sometime during this month.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And my follow-up is just a little quick one, the guidance for this current year, is that still a good number? And if you could comment on the contribution from the acquisition and I'll leave it at that.","David E. Roberts","Yes. We're not moving off of our numbers in terms of what our guidance for the existing acreage that we have is. I think, critically, in the earnings release, we feel very good about what happened to us in April in terms of our ability to essentially add 1,200 barrels a day net on a weekly basis. And now that we're running 18 rigs across the portfolio with fully subscribed 4 frac crews, we believe that we're going to be able to add the 16 and 20 wells a month to the portfolio. So that guidance remains intact. We understand that we've got a lot of work to do there. With respect to Paloma, we've characterized that acreage position, we've characterized it as something that will pick up 7,000 barrels a day when it comes into our portfolio, hopefully in August. My view is that will be the number that we get. And you could look for that position to grow slightly over -- towards the end of the year to maybe 9,000 or 10,000 barrels a day. We'll see once we get a hold of it, we're going to be very careful with it. But on the annualized basis, I guess that puts us and being able to talk about our overall Eagle Ford of between 32-plus thousand barrels a day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you just said this, but the 767 is not in the updated budget number for this year, the acquisition.","Clarence P. Cazalot","That excludes -- correct, it excludes all acquisitions.","Janet F. Clark","And it does include some follow-on capital for that acquisition.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. I appreciate that. Can you comment at all on what you're seeing in terms of well costs in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and then just any update on your Niobrara drilling?","David E. Roberts","Yes. Arjun, I think we're still pretty comfortable with this 8.5 range for our Bakken well. And that's what we had kind of anticipated once we've got to 30-stage fracs. Any increases that we're seeing there are really ones that we're driving in terms of maybe adding a little bit more fluid to the completions or whatnot. We're actually seeing some of the heat come off of the pressure pumping market across the U.S. And so that's going to help us hold our costs in as far as that goes. In the Eagle Ford, we're still very comfortable with this $8.5 million, again, well costs there. We have fixed contracts and so we're not seeing as much price relief potentially as we'd like in that part of the basin. But one of the things I would say is that we're seeing a lot of pressure on GOR pricing in South Texas because of the hot activity. And our commitments, I think, are going to allow us to remain outside of some of that inability to get products. So we still feel pretty good about what our pricing is in both of our key hot basins. We're running 2 rigs in the Niobrara. Where really in an important phase right now. We've got 7 wells that we're doing completions on. We've done most of these with cementless completions. It's a change from what we had done a little bit earlier. We brought one online this week. It's very early days. But it's flowing, it's a little bit less than 500 barrels a day. We're typically seeing 200 barrels a day out of these wells on pump, but we'll see if the cementless completion actually works for us. We'll know a little bit more towards the beginning part of June. But again, our big issue there is we still are concerned with the fact that these, in our view, are 250,000 to 300,000 EUR wells. We're still drilling these wells for a little bit north of $5 million. We've got to get that cost down to $4 million and get better completions. So as we've said consistently, this is an interesting exploration project, that's how I'd characterize it. But we'll get to some more interesting data in the next 30 to 60 days.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to -- I think you said this frankly, very clearly, but just to be triply sure, the guidance that you previously gave on the Eagle Ford for the end of the year is reiterated. And then any acquisitions -- the acquisitions that you just announced essentially are incremental to that guidance. I think I've said that right, if you could just confirm that. And then if you could talk about your outlook for acquisitions going forward in that region, that would be great.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. I think, Paul, first of all, we do confirm our original guidance, and the acquisitions would be incremental. And I'd say we see additional small acquisitions. But for the most part, I think we've completed the bulk of our acquisition activity in the Eagle Ford.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. I just wanted to be triple sure. And then on the pricing down there, could you just talk about how that's going? It's obviously very noisy out there. And I just wondered if you could update us on how crude prices are moving. And perhaps what the outlook is there because it is so hard to kind of work out what's going on.","David E. Roberts","Yes. I think, Paul, we're pretty consistent that we've -- since we took this over and most of the assets that we acquired were on WTI contracts, we've been working very hard to move this to an LLS-based crude. We believe we've gotten there and we are pretty firm that it's LLS minus 6 and we think that's where the market is. There is, obviously, going to be some tightening over time. But right now, we think that's a good marker for you all to use. Yes, and I think to get to that point -- yesterday we actually started flowing some of our crude down pipelines, which essentially secures that pricing mechanism. And importantly, it's going to get substantial number of our trucks off the road, which we think is important for how we operate in South Texas as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. Dave, can you tell us that in Eagle Ford the date you picked to drill each well on average over the last, say, 3 months that what you've been able to do? And also the 30-day IP, as well as that you already give us the well cost, how about the cash operating cost that you're seeing on a per boe basis on the Eagle Ford and Bakken?","David E. Roberts","Okay. Yes. Paul, as I think we pointed out in the release, our spud-to-spud days in the Eagle Ford have fallen to 25 days over the last 3 or 4 months. Frankly, I expect us to be able to drive that even lower. And we are seeing some wells lower than that band. We think that, that's as good as there is in the basin. We're going to continue to test our limits to drive that forward on a go-forward basis. As I said a little bit earlier, consistent with the information that we put out at innumerable conferences, I'd still refer you to the charts that we have on our single well economics for the 30-day IPs, for the various fields that we've got out there, high GOR, 675 is the number we have out there. And you heard me mention to Doug a little bit earlier that we will see some of the condensate wells, and we're expecting those at 1,650 boes per day. Having said that, as I mentioned earlier, most of the wells that we're drilling out there in the high-GOR area are above those expectations, and so we may continue to improve those on a go-forward basis. We have had some cost pressure, both in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, in terms of operating costs. Eagle Ford not unexpected. We stood up a huge business unit to prepare for what we expect is going to be 100,000 barrels a day business. And so we're seeing some pretty significant costs quarter-on-quarter there. And we've seen Bakken increases in the first quarter over last year as we moved into the Diomedes area, which is a higher water area in the Bakken. Generally, I would say that, while the basins fall within our guidance range of $8.50 to $9.50 per barrel per FLC with the Eagle Ford being toward the high end of that range and the Bakken towards the low end of it, but what I would say is that once we get the businesses underway, particularly in the Eagle Ford, my expectation is that next year, you're going to see those numbers fall back into the $7 to $8 range across our unconventional basins.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Nice. Final question. Dave, do you have the average for your Eagle Ford and Bakken production? And also do you have the breakdown, what you expect next year in Bakken and Eagle Ford, the percent of frac oil, condensate and NGLs from your output going to look like, based on the well that you're going to drill?","David E. Roberts","Yes. The Bakken is oil plays, 100%. And so we're producing, right now, as we've kind of indicated, 25,000, 26,000 barrels a day. And I think we've been pretty just positive on what we expect those rates to go forward and it's going to be 100% oil. On the Eagle Ford, the 20,000 barrels a day plus minus that we're producing, it's 80% condensate, 7% NGLs and the remainder is natural gas. And I would expect that those ratios are going to hang in line 85% liquids and the remainder natural gas as we continue to progress up the curve that we've also been very open about sharing into the future.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The 20,000 exit rate, do you have a number that you can share on the average for April?","Howard J. Thill","We haven't gone there yet, Paul. We have not given an average.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rakesh Advani of Credit Suisse.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the Eagle Ford. You've been pretty open how the lower GOR oil has been less economic. Would you guys consider JV-ing or selling that acreage?","David E. Roberts","No. Well, I mean -- okay, let me backtrack a little bit. In the low-GOR oil area that we classified, yes. We've said consistently we would be open to opportunities to allow somebody else to participate in those areas. In the lower end, high-GOR areas, if I can be that specific, no. We would not be interested in diluting our interest.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Because you guys have flagged drilling costs in the Woodford were too high. Have you changed the approach to help bring these down?","David E. Roberts","Yes. We've been very quick to adapt to what other operators in the areas have done, both in specific areas. But also some of their specific techniques, and we've been able to dramatically drop our spud-to-spud times there from 7 plus days to 50 or less. So we've been very pleased with our team's performance in being able to execute in the Woodford and Oklahoma.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","It's actually Drew Banker [ph]. Just had 2 quick questions on the Eagle Ford. Are the results in Wilson and Gonzalez County in line with your expectations? And how do those compare with the results in your focus area in Karnes County?","David E. Roberts","Okay, Drew [ph]. I think what I would say is -- we consistently say that Wilson was below our expectations, and we are not conducting any activities by and large in those areas. Gonzalez is a little bit different. We've got rigs running across some of those areas. And to this point, we've been fairly pleased that those wells exhibit some very positive characteristics of the high-GOR oils that we've expected. So what we call our union area and certainly, a little bit south to that, in the DeWitt County area, we've been very pleased with. So far, so good there. But Wilson, we think is challenged with respect to the Eagle Ford.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And where is the acreage that you picked up?","David E. Roberts","It's in the core area. So mostly in the Karnes area is what we would say.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. First on the Bakken, it looked like your U.S. crude price realizations were a little bit lower. Is there an effect from the depressed Bakken pricing we saw in the winter months?","David E. Roberts","Yes.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what have the trends been recently?","David E. Roberts","Well, I mean, this morning, as I've been pretty consistently saying, we expect that the trends to close back. And this morning, the differential was $2. So we're back into this total range of both transportation from the well and differential to about a minus 7 to WTI. So the Bakken's recovered very nicely.","Clarence P. Cazalot","So has syn crude, Pavel, because as you know, the OSM earnings were affected by lower price realizations. And again, the same kind of dislocations we saw that affected the Bakken affected our syn crude realizations as well. So both have recovered very nicely. Those differentials have come in quite a bit. In fact, syn crude is actually a little bit of a premium this morning to WTI.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Kurdistan, you mentioned there is a non-operated Sarsang well that's currently drilling. Any plans for 2012 to actually operate a well on either of your owned blocks?","David E. Roberts","Yes. We will be drilling at least one well on a Marathon-operated block in 2012, and may get the second one started. So we will actually be conducting operations this summer.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So spudding in Q3 or...","David E. Roberts","Sometime in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You guys have already a fairly large position in the Eagle Ford. So I was wondering if you could -- how would you characterize this transaction? Is it -- is this a transaction that you guys are doing -- or these series of transactions, does this help you kind of accelerate some of your drilling program? Or are these kind of -- is this an acreage position that's adjacent or right on top of your current acreage? I'm just trying to figure out the kind of the strategic rationale behind adding more to your position in the Eagle Ford.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. I think, Faisal, what I'd say is these additional acquisitions are very complementary adjacent to what we already own. And so to a certain extent, as Dave said, we built a very substantial and we think a very capable operating presence. These assets will be able to develop and produce synergistically with the assets we already have, so they make a great deal of sense. And so we've been very clear upfront that to the extent we can acquire these kinds of bolt-on acquisitions, whether it's additional working interest in our existing acreage or additional acreage that we can develop, we believe at a competitive advantage, that's of interest to us. And certainly that's what we're doing with these acquisitions.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then can you remind me how much are you guys spending on infrastructure in the Eagle Ford, gathering and processing and the sort of things that take your liquids to market?","David E. Roberts","I'd put that number close to $200 million this year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question for me, the Ozona development, can you comment a little bit about what happened? What didn't work? Or what wasn't working versus your expectations of production?","David E. Roberts","Yes, I can. I think, again, we've run into a smallest-sized reservoir issue that has, what I would characterize as very channelized flow regime, and we've not seen the pressure support from any kind of meaningful drive mechanism. It's not the same problems. It's very similar to what we've seen in some of the other recent developments we've done. And it's, frankly, it's put us all chasing these smaller targets in the Gulf.","Operator","The next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Regarding the Bakken activity, could you further delineate how much of the contribution for volume adds you're getting is from the middle Bakken versus Three Forks?","David E. Roberts","Yes, John. It also gives me a chance to say that we actually do make about 5% of our volume from natural gas there. So much as I'd like to say it's 100% oil, I can't quite claim that. To this point, the vast majority of our activity is middle Bakken focused. We started feathering in summer activities in the Three Forks. And in fact, the biggest well Marathon has enjoyed to date, we saw last quarter there were 2,400 barrels a day from the Three Forks. And so we'll start to see more and more of that feature into, particularly, the third well, where we put most spacing units. But to this point, we're still a middle Bakken player and you'll see us increase our focus on the Three Forks on a go-forward basis, particularly in the core part of our acreage there.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Will you look at other formations like the Lodgepole or Nisku? Or is it something later on?","David E. Roberts","Well, as -- our practice across all of our big plays is to really try to stay focused on where we can create the most value. We're not going to leave anything behind. And we continue to look for that. We'll pay attention to what a lot of the other operators are doing out there. But our organization and people who follow this company should understand we focus on making sure we create the most value first and then chasing these other opportunities.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me is on Poland. Any news to speak of yet?","David E. Roberts","No, not really. We basically are pretty close to done with our third well. We had one disappointment with the second well in terms of the zone not really being present in terms of what we were looking for. So we've got some more drilling to do. We'll actually start doing some of our injectivity testing in the second half of the year. And from that, we'll determine if we actually frac any of this. So it's still early days, but at this point, I would say it's middle of the road.","Operator","And last question is a follow-up question from Rakesh Advani of Credit Suisse.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you update us on the progression towards your asset sale targets?","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. We've talked about beyond the sales we've had over the last several years that we were targeting another $1.5 billion to $3 billion by the end of 2013. And thus far, this year, we've announced the sale of our Alaska assets. So that's the only update. We've not yet talked about the actual purchase price for those assets. We will at the appropriate time. But I would say that's the first this year. We had last year over $600 million of asset sales that would contribute towards that same target.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And should we think about it as just being I guess more back-end weighted? Or kind of 50-50 over the next years? Or...","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. Again, we don't predict the schedule by which we'll have these sales. We certainly only do the sales if they make economic sense. But I wouldn't give you a projection of when to expect announcements around asset sales.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just the last one is are you guys doing any down spacing or water float tests in the Bakken that you can comment on?","David E. Roberts","Well, I think we've continued to chase what other people are doing in terms of -- we started this, obviously, on 12.80s, we're now moving very smartly to 3 wells on our drilling spacing unit, and we'll probably go beyond that. So in that vein, we are continuing to down space. We think it makes a lot of sense. We're studying enhanced recovery in the Bakken and the other unconventionals, but do not have any physical test plan or anything like a waterflood or any other type of enhanced recovery project at this point.","Operator","We have another follow-up question in queue from Paul Cheng's line of Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, do you have an exit rate you expect for Bakken and Eagle Ford for the end of this year?","David E. Roberts","Paul, we've not giving that information to this point. But April, as I've said, we're 20,000 plus in the Eagle Ford. But we're not talking about exit rates at this particular point.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I don't know what I did wrongly in the math. But if we're going to hit 30,000 barrel per day, that seems to suggest that the second half, you to be average more than 40,000. So it look like the fourth quarter, you need to be in excess of 50,000. Is that tie up expectation that we should have?","David E. Roberts","Well, Paul, I think what I said a little bit earlier is when we have that capability, which we do today, to add 16 to 20 wells per month for the remaining part of the year, and in April, we've been able to add over 1,000 barrels a day per week, I think what I would say to you is there's a number of ways you can get to that particular math. But we now have the capacity to get to the numbers similar to what you suggested to get to our average rates for the year.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back over to Howard Thill for any closing remarks.","Howard J. Thill","Thank you very much. And before we close, I want to take just a moment to say goodbye to an important member of our team who is retiring at the end of this month, Bonnie Chisum, and who has been in our Investor Relations team for the last 10 years, and a 39-year employee for Marathon Oil Corporation, as I said is retiring at the end of this month. And we wish her well. We know many of you know her. And with that, we will end the call and wish everyone a good afternoon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chris Phillips. You may begin.","Chris Phillips ","Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation's third quarter 2014 earnings call. I'm Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; J. R. Sult, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mitch Little, Vice President, International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations and Lance Robertson, Vice President, North America Product Operations. As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release.

I refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Tillman ","Well, let me add my good morning. I want to open with a few comments on our outstanding operational performance focusing on those execution elements that are within the control of our excellent asset teams. First and foremost, our three high quality U.S. resource plays continue to deliver on our growth objectives with over 40% year-on-year growth and double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter. The Eagle Ford had a record quarter with 87 gross operated wells to sales, including eight Austin Chalk wells. We brought 19 gross operated wells to sales in the Bakken with eight of those piloting enhanced completion designs with encouraging early results.","We also spud three high-density Bakken pilots with 12 wells per drilling unit and brought 13 additional recompletions to sales. Per our plan we have added an incremental rig in the Bakken to provide additional capacity for our high-density spacing and completion pilots and we are on track to add two incremental rigs in the Oklahoma Resource Basins before year-end to continue SCOOP development, STACK delineation and new horizon testing in the Springer, Caney and Granite Wash. We also grew our Oklahoma Resource Basin position by executing agreements for approximately 12,000 net acres in the SCOOP, including acres perspective in the emerging Springer formation.","Internationally, we closed our Norway transaction for approximately $2.1 billion in proceeds and had excellent early results from our UK Brae platform drilling program, with both wells exceeding free drill expectations. In exploration, we spud our Key Largo inboard Paleogene prospect, our first well in a multi-year GoM exploration program and expect to spud our first well in the EG exploration program before year-end.","Additionally, we successfully negotiated and executed our exploration and production sharing contract for Gabon Block G13 now named Tchicuate. An acquisition of 3D seismic is planned to begin in early November over this promising block.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect growth in North America E&P production available for sale and remain on track to deliver over 30% year-on-year growth from the U.S. resource plays. International E&P production available for sale, excluding Libya is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting improved reliability and no significant planned maintenance activities.","Fourth quarter oil sands mining production is expected to decrease from third quarter volumes due to planned maintenance at the mine. Our full year volumes guidance has been narrowed to 350,000 to 360,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day for production available for sale from the combined North America E&P and international E&P segments excluding Libya and discontinued operations. The recent correction in commodity prices has rightly captured the attention of investors and operators alike. Marathon Oil through the strength of our balance sheet, which has recently benefitted from the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our Norway business is well positioned for a lower product price market.","Although we have yet to finalize our 2015 capital program, at the macro level we are incorporating the latest commodity price volatility into our business planning but remain confident in our forward growth plans with strong cash flows and the proceeds from our completed asset sales to support the continued development of our deep and high quality inventory in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins.","Our U.S. opportunity set remains economically robust across a broad range of pricing scenarios and we continually high grade and enhance our single well economics through the work of the asset teams via completion optimization, downspacing, capital efficiency and the testing of additional horizons.","We expect our resource play programs to progress fundamentally unchanged with no plans to reduce rig count, except where productivity permits. Our continued focus on capital discipline and portfolio management has us well positioned to invest intelligently through the commodity cycle, and we will use the optionality across our opportunity inventory to maximize returns while retaining flexibility.","We have a comprehensive process for examining CapEx at the margin and our investment portfolio has the requisite granularity to ensure all opportunities are fully tested for capital allocation. We have clear line of sight on our multiyear commitment as well as those areas of our business that are more discretionary and scalable in nature. Our resource plays are not the marginal capital dollars. So the key question will be more around pay and further acceleration as we balance growth with returns.","We will also focus on protecting and expanding margins through continued expense management and commercial leverage with our service providers. We readily acknowledge our inability to predict pricing but are in good stead to progress profitable growth and drive shareholder value across range of macro-economic environments.","Let\u2019s now open for your questions. And as a reminder, we do have our two operational Vice Presidents joining us today. So please take full advantage of their participation. Back to Chris to kick us off.","Chris Phillips","Thanks Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we\u2019d like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications. And you can re-prompt as time permits. With that Christine, we\u2019ll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","I just wanted to I mean obviously you said in your opening remarks that you don\u2019t see a need to change. But say oil prices continue to trade lower, get a sense of what it is that you think would be the first thing that you might defer in terms of the overall CapEx spending?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, of course Ed, we\u2019re going to be releasing our full view of the capital program in December. But to address your point specifically, I want to emphasize that our portfolio here in the U.S. is robust again across a broad range of pricing scenarios. And so we don\u2019t view the U.S. portfolio as our marginal capital dollar. But we are well positioned to look at our full portfolio, look at those elements that maybe non-reserve adding or more discretionary in nature, if we do see more moderation in the pricing environment. We want to be intelligent as we move through this commodity price correction but we certainly feel very strong about the quality of our inventory.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right. And then some good progress up in the Bakken. Maybe talk a little bit about EUR expectations and IPs? Obviously you\u2019ve got some core acreage there; but you\u2019ve perhaps been a bit behind the peer group in terms of using the latest technologies. So just an update on where we are.","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, I\u2019ll make a few opening comments and then maybe I\u2019d ask Lance to chime in. But we are moving much more aggressive in the Bakken. As we stated in our release we\u2019ve added an incremental rig effective in September to help us move forward, not only with the downspacing program but also with the enhanced completion designs. And some of the wells of course we brought, the sales were in fact part of our pilot testing and completions, some of these enhanced completions, which have shown some very promising early results. But maybe I\u2019ll ask Lance just to comment specifically on some of the enhanced completions that we have been able to test thus far.","Lance Robertson","Yes. We\u2019ve had a very busy Q3, and actually the second half of the second quarter this year in terms of testing those. We recognize the need to continue to move forward with the most effective and best available technologies. To-date we\u2019ve actually had 17 of the 45 wells that Lee talked about originally at Barclays online to sales in that testing. That group is been comprised of wells testing most specifically increased profit loading on a number of those wells. In fact a majority of them have had up to 6 million pounds of profit. We\u2019ve also tested incremental stages in those wells, surfactants in two or three of those wells, as well as incremental stages adding for small or more finite stage delivery and then a change in fluid volume, both a decrease and in most cases an increase of fluid volume. And I would say in the overwhelming majority of those wells, the early response of the 30 day IP has been at or above a type curve. So it\u2019s early. We'd like to see those cumulative production volumes mature a little bit but we're very encouraged by those results and we'll have the balance of those wells, probably two-thirds to three quarters online in sales in the fourth quarter with a few of those completions pilots trailing into the first quarter, Ed.,","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","And so, just very quickly the breakeven oil price you think for that core Bakken or maybe too early to say?","Lance Robertson","","I think we'd recognize that across our portfolio Myrmidon, Hector and Ajax very different between the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks and all three of those areas. So there's a range of pricing in there. Our focus is how much better we can make each of those areas in this current commodity price environment or any environment to really compete for capital. As we move through the budgeting process we're going to focus on the wells that deliver the highest returns for next year. ","Lee Tillman","But I think just kind of building on that a little bit, Ed, certainly in our core areas in the Bakken we have a lot of confidence going forward in their ability to compete per capital allocation, even with the commodity price correction. Those are very strong wells for us. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","I'm sure you can imagine we want to see slightly paddle long on the same theme of sensitivity of CapEx. ","Lee Tillman","","I said I am shocked Paul. ","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes alright. Apologies by the way if this noise issues here -- someone seems to be fracing Park Avenue right now. But if you could talk about where the sensitivity does lay, you mentioned that there's other areas that don\u2019t add reserves directly or I wasn\u2019t quite -- if you could just be more specific about where you would be looking to cut back, if you needed to and at what type of point you feel you would have to cut back CapEx as well? If you could talk about that for next year? Thanks. ","Lee Tillman","","And again Paul, I don\u2019t want to push the downtime but we do plan to comeback in a comprehensive way in December and really detail out our plan. We're right in the midst of our planning process and like many of our peer group, I think our planning process has been bit overtaken by the change in the commodity price environment. But when we talk about looking at the full portfolio, when we test our U.S. resource plays, again they just are simply not are marginal capital dollars. So we look at those moving forward largely unchanged, meaning that we're still committed to the two incremental rigs in Oklahoma plus the rig that we've already added in the Bakken. ","Beyond those elements of our portfolio, we do have aspects that are more discretionary in nature, that are either non-reserve add bearing or particularly longer term investments, including even within our exploration portfolio that we'll take a hard look at it in from a CapEx at the margin standpoint. But we haven\u2019t put any limiter to this point on our budget process but we want to make sure that we invest intelligently, recognizing the change in commodity pricing. ","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes I got. So I understood that about the unconventional U.S. not being the marginal barrel. Could you talk a bit about the parameters of cash balances and cash flows that you want to work with and just remind us of how you see credit rating, how you see dividend obviously et cetera. Thank you. ","Lee Tillman","","I'll maybe say few words, then invite J.R. to also time in. But and foremost and I think we've been very clear on this point, as you know we do not view our operating cash flows per se as a limiter on our investment program. If we have good investment opportunities to pursue, then we certainly are going to take those on and leverage the strength of our balance sheet to support that. Now over the long-term, is being within cash flows good discipline? Absolutely. But when it comes to calls on our capital, maybe I'll turnover to J.R. and just let him emphasize how we do that. ","J. R. Sult","","Well, I think when you about it more broadly as Lee indicated in his earlier remarks, not only where the balance sheet exists today, even now with incremental $2.1 billion capital from the disposition of Norway, that really gives us tremendous optionality as we're doing this almost as plug-n-play exercise with regard to determining what the right capital allocation is throughout the portfolio. It gives us that ability to use as much of those proceeds as we think is prudent, to either both grow and earn the record [ph] return that we think is necessary for our shareholders without in anyway jeopardizing the strength of that balance sheet. Honestly as you know commodity price environment is where it is. It does present or could present opportunities in the future as well. And we want to make sure that we are well positioned to take care of and pursue those potential opportunities. ","Operator","","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","So I've got a couple also, Lee, if I may. I want to go -- same theme as you can imagine. If I go back to Oklahoma, when you gave us the resource update back in September that was one of the biggest drivers of your backlog increase. Obviously is a bit more gassy and some of the acreage I'm guessing is still being added. So I'm trying to understand what is the trade-off between a very large position and very small rig count? In other words you could probably do a lot more if the economics are competitive and really what was the trade-off between holding acreage out of necessity as opposed to drilling for the economic return? Then I've got a follow-up, please.","Lee Tillman"," ","Well, first of all, let me try to address your question I guess around product mix and Oklahoma. First and foremost, we\u2019ve been drilling primarily leasehold and potentially all leasehold this year in Oklahoma. In fact even this quarter as well, the [indiscernible] the SCOOP to in the -- and the STACK are essentially drilling leasehold. Now within that, we quoted one particular IP that I believe had liquid content around 55%. That\u2019s actually a lane condensate well.","When we look across the wells that we drilled in this quarter, the liquid yields on those wells from the low 70s to the low80s. So these are relatively high liquids content wells and competed very favorably for capital allocation. And as we move and transition from a mode of holding leases to optimizing our development plans, we\u2019ll have a lot more opportunity to move closer into the core areas, which we also feel will have higher liquids yield.","And then as we test further some of this exploration horizons, including the Springer, our view of those very early on is mainly on the back of our participation, some of our OBO wells is that those are also going to be very high liquid yield. So, we do not necessarily see Oklahoma driving us per say to be more gassy. In fact just the opposite. We see very good liquid yields, particularly as we move into the core areas of the play. And those wells will compete head-to-head with the wells that we have in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. Hence we\u2019re very comfortable with the two incremental high spec rigs we'll be bringing in later this year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch"," ","But Lee, what I'm getting at is that still leaves me with a relatively limited rig counted compared to the size of the opportunity. So I'm just trying to understand, right now you\u2019ve got a multi-decade drilling inventory with a peer with only a few rigs running. So I\u2019m just trying to understand where that slacks up in terms of competing for capital relative to the rest of the portfolio?","Lee Tillman","Well certainly you're correct Doug. We\u2019re in the very early days in Oklahoma. We\u2019re in the early days of understanding downspacing, completion design, the key core areas and delineating the core areas of the field and certainly in the early days of things like the Springer and the Caney and Granite Wash.","So we are -- but I think adding that additional rig capacity is going to first and foremost allow us to ensure that we protect our lease hold, but secondly is going to allow us to get out in front of really understanding the full potential of that area and then we\u2019ll make a progressive and measured and thoughtful ramp up from there. Bear in mind, we have moved from two rigs in 2013 to basically four rigs this year moving to six and so we are moving up quite aggressively in terms of rig count. And we see that rig capacity being very well justified based on the inventory we see in front of us. So I think it's just a question, as we learn more about the play Doug, we\u2019ll generate more confidence to move more aggressively with that ramp up in activity, just like we've done in most of the other resource plays.","Unidentified Analyst "," ","Thank you. And my quick follow-up is for J.R. Just now that you've cleaned up the portfolio with Norway, J.R., can you give us an idea of what the current tax -- that is the deferred tax guidance should be on a go forward basis? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","J. R. Sult","","Doug, I think that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we\u2019ve cleaned up the portfolio with Norway. We\u2019ve definitely simplified the portfolio and concentrated it more towards North America. I don\u2019t think you should in anyway think that we\u2019re done with portfolio management. It's very integral to capital allocation. But when I think about deferred taxes going forward, we are going to be a very U.S. centered cash flow company. We\u2019ve given guidance from an effective tax rate standpoint in the 30% to 35% standpoint and I think you should assume that I do not expect to be U.S. tax payer for the foreseeable future and adjust your deferred taxes accordingly.","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","","If I could do one follow-up question on CapEx from a slightly different angle. I know that the absolute level of the CapEx budget is probably still quite a bit and flux given the current environment, but if we think about year-on-year, your ability to shift CapEx is in the portfolio towards the U.S. onshore, obviously you've got lower CapEx year-on-year from the Norway sale. How should we think about how much CapEx you might be able to flex within that portfolio towards the U.S. onshore in 2015 in a flat CapEx environment?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, certainly Ryan, our intent is to always prioritize and flex our capital allocation toward the highest returns. And in this case there is no doubt that the three U.S. resource plays are in very good stead to compete for that capital allocation. In fact that was part of the basis for moving more aggressively with the additional rigs that we\u2019re bringing in before the end of the year.","As we think about CapEx broadly, as you rightly say Norway accounted for about $500 million-ish our $5.9 billion in CapEx. And so as we look at kind of re-base lining our CapEx spend going forward, you kind of have to reorient back to that $5.4 billion type number. And so that\u2019s a bit of a starting point from where we are today. And then we\u2019ll test to see how much more aggressive we want to be in that in terms of really the pace and the acceleration level that we want to step into in the U.S. resource play.","Beyond that, we\u2019ll look very hard at CapEx at the margin outside of the U.S. resource plays to ensure that we make reasonable decisions based on the commodity price environment, which, as everyone knows, is still moving and really hasn\u2019t found equilibrium yet.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks. And then maybe one follow up on the Eagle Ford. Stronger than expected results, at least on from our expectations in terms of production in the quarter and obviously a lot of that was driven by record completions. But can you talk as well about -- you mentioned 59 wells at over 180 days production on the enhanced completions and 25% improvement relative to type curves. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen to-date in terms of how much you think about earlier capture and how much [indiscernible] flow towards higher EURs?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll let Lance. He is already smiling though because you acknowledged the great performance in the Eagle Ford. So I'm sure I'm going to pay for that later. So Lance why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about the enhanced completion design?","Lance Robertson","Sure. I\u2019d say directionally, Eagle Ford is performing where we expected it to this year, starting the year knowing we would gain efficiencies through the year. So some part of what you\u2019ve seen in that production growth is driven by at a constant activity in the field just getting more and more efficient with the existing equipment and people. Certainly a credit to the team for their drive on that basis.","The second part of the growth is driven, perhaps a large part of it by the simulation design. As we\u2019ve tested stage spacing, profit loading perforation clusters and rate, we found a better completion design. And through the third quarter, almost 60 wells had reached six months of cumulative production and that uplift is about 25%. And so as we have a relatively constant pace of activity in the field and we get better well performance across a large group of wells, you're really seen that move through and create that broad production lift in the field. So this current design is working very well. As you would imagine we\u2019re out testing additional enhancements to that design for future improvement. I think we\u2019re very satisfied by that this year and what we\u2019ve learned from that will take us to the next steps in terms of enhancement and future growth.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","And is it too early to speculate as to whether you\u2019ve shifted the entire curve up or whether you\u2019ve just pulled forward production?","Lance Robertson","That\u2019s a great question, and right now what we see is early well performance is very strong. We\u2019d like to see those wells mature. We\u2019re focused on creating more value per drilling spacing unit by bring those volumes forward in time and doing it in a very capital efficient manner. I think as those wells mature and we have that history that we\u2019ll reevaluate the EURs and talk about potential for resource growth later this year or early next.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering & Holt","Just one follow up on capital allocation, you talked about the U.S. onshore and international CapEx. Just focusing specifically on exploration, what\u2019s your view on capital spend there over the next few years?","Lee Tillman","Well, certainly as we included in the investor package, our near term focus is really wrapped around the Gulf of Mexico. We\u2019re really bringing that into full view right now. We\u2019ve got multiple wells that we\u2019re executing in the Gulf, our operated Key Largo well. In addition we have an appraisal well and another exploration well that\u2019s non-operated. So a lot of focus on the Gulf of Mexico in the near term. But I think what you\u2019ll find is that the program is much more focused in the next couple of years. So we would expect to see some moderation in the overall exploration spend regardless of the pricing environment. This is not really linked directly to pricing. This is just a function of us continuing to drive focus towards oil prone emerging plays that we think can be accretive and can compete for capital allocation across our full portfolio. So you'll see that we have a focus as we move through towards the end of the year on our EG program, which we think is also quite promising and also plays right to that fair way on oil prone emerging plays. And maybe I could ask our Vice President on the International side just to comment just briefly on the EG program, which we hope to kick-off at the end of the year. ","T. Mitch Little","","Yeah, thanks Lee and thanks for the question. Just quickly following up on the Lee\u2019s comments. We will start a two well exploration program most likely towards the very end of the year this year. It\u2019s in an area offsetting a couple of proven fields just across the international border. We're very encouraged with the revised interpretations from integrating reprocess size mix. We see chance of success for these in excess of 50% based on integrating all of the data available to us, and on a gross resources basis, with the multiple follow-on prospects, we see potential ranging from 200 million to 500 million barrels. So certainly a material opportunity that we'll be testing late this year. ","Lee Tillman","","Okay, thanks, Mitch. So bottom-line is certainly in the near-term, next couple of years, we see much more focused, a better moderation in our exploration spend that are really driving at these high impact oil prone prospects.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering & Holt","","And then lastly on the Oil Sands Mining, can you talk about progress towards improved reliability there and then plans for that long-term as well?","Lee Tillman","","Yes absolutely. I'll maybe make a few comments and then I'll offer Lance an opportunity to chime in as well. I think we had a strong performance in the third quarter but the reality is one quarter a trend does not make. We still have some hard work left to do on the reliability front. Lance and his team are working with our other joint venture partners, as well as the operator on the reliability front and maybe Lance, I'll just let you comment on how that work is progressing. ","Lance Robertson","","I think the operator and the joint venture partners of which we're more clearly focused on reliability. We are making progress there. The variability in quarterly performance is higher than we would like it to be. I think the peers would agree. So we're focused and I would say broadly the third quarter showed some support on reliability focus but there is a dedicated program that is focused and targeted at the key mine reliability impact that we have experienced over the past few years. And so it\u2019s too early to tell but certainly the rigor and the focus is there. That consistent results remain to be delivered.","Lee Tillman","","And I think again to -- also to the operators' credit, I think they did move the needle this quarter. I think they have also brought in some more focused mining leadership into the operation, and we think those are all positive signs. But again we need to see that consistent performance quarter-on-quarter from the OSM operation. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. ","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","","Surprise, surprise but I wanted to start off with capital spending and this year\u2019s budget, but it would appear that you all have been able to accomplish more within the confines of that original budget than may have been initially planned. Granted Norway is dropping out but you're adding three rigs, albeit late in the year. You're testing various completion enhancements in the Bakken. You've enhanced completion designs in the Eagle Ford. You're more active in Oklahoma. So it appears like you're doing more with the same amount of capital as the budgets then changed. Is that a fair observation that we've made. And can you discuss maybe where you've driven efficiencies and spending and what some of those implications might be for 2015 as we think about your budgeting process?","Lee Tillman","Well certainly we are on track on our capital budget this year. There have been pluses and minuses across the budget. Some of those have been timing impacts as we've had rigs arrive later than expected. A good example of that is the EG program, which we thought would be kicked-off before now but the operator that has the rig has had some success in his currently testing. So there are some timing impacts there. But I agree with -- we have been able to do more in this year\u2019s program from an activity perspective particularly in the U.S. resource play.","The additional rigs really haven\u2019t put a lot of pressure on us because they've come somewhat late in the year but the higher intensity completion design certainly in the Eagle Ford, where we have such a high number of wells to sales, absolutely that has put some upward pressure into the budget. But that\u2019s all been well justified based on economics. As we look at the incremental returns of those higher intensity completion designs, those are generating a 100% incremental rates of returns. So we have been able to drive a bit more success, a bit more activity this year within the confines of the $5.9 billion budget. ","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Okay, great. Then I had a follow-up for Lance. But obviously across the portfolio, drilling longer laterals in the Bakken, testing enhance completion design. So it does -- it appears there is some experimentation going on that I would imagine might make it difficult in driving continued improvement to the cycle times, in your spud to TD time. So could you discuss maybe a little bit for us, your view on the evolution of cycle times, from where we stand today in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken and how you balance that with improved well performance and just how we should be thinking about that?","Lance Robertson","Absolutely Guy. We continue to focus above all else on value in the resource plays and which requires us to continue to focus on completion enhancement, every month, every quarter to find that opportunity to create that enhanced value. Within the chain, the teams are focused on that and that systematic development. So let's start first with an Eagle Ford. They've been systematically developing and they've been at a constant rate through this year in terms of activity. You see that activity quarter after quarter. They continue to get more efficient and bring more wells to sales, even as they continue to experiment. So I look at that as a great success that we\u2019re controlling and managing that capital that Lee referenced.","And so while we are spending more per well to generate that value, it's certainly worth it and the team is continuing to actually bring that per well cost down, even if they enhance it broadly through efficiencies. And I would say, incumbent in that, in the first-half of the year, we actually achieved a substantial amount of savings and efficiencies in a well and commercial leverage across our service lines. And then from mid-year forward, it has been effectively flat.","So that\u2019s really helped offset much of the capital spend you referenced earlier, as we achieve those savings early in the year. And then looking at Bakken, they are experimenting more. It's a very mature team. They continue to get faster this year. They were more than a day faster on the spud to TD cycle even what they changes you referenced. That mature team is very systematic with planning those completing optimization pilots, putting those in a queue and managing those effectively. And as you\u2019ve seen our production grow 12% from Q2 to Q3, well I would say that broadly their execution remains very robust, even in the face of that experimentation and we expect that to continue as we move forward.","Lee Tillman"," ","I guess I would just say in the resource play, that component of experimentation is just part of the business model. We have to do that to continue to drive optimization, capital efficiency into the resource play. So, our asset teams view that just part of the expectations.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","","That\u2019s very helpful. And then more -- I guess a final quick one for me. Do you all have a target Eagle Ford production exit rate for the year that you might be willing to share?","Lee Tillman","","No currently Guy. We\u2019ll spend some time at the end of the year, chatting a little bit about exit rates and forward-looking rates and all three of the resource plays.","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale"," ","Yes. Hi, this is either for Lee or J.R. Given a large review as focus, any change in view with respect to product hedging, commodity price hedging?","Lee Tillman"," ","That sounds like a great question for J. R. ","J.R. Sult","","Now we've talked about it on a pass couple of calls. We try and look at the commodity price risk through the lens of our ability to meet what we believe is kind of the core of a capital program necessary to achieve and kind of those growth and return metrics that we set out for ourselves internally and that\u2019s the way we look at it.","Now no doubt today, we are and still remain substantially un-hedged when you look out to 2015. It is something we will continue to consider. We\u2019ll look at the risks, not only the downside but also to the risk with the lost opportunity to the upside. But the focus is more in terms of that core capital program and our ability and our assessment of the probability of being able to fund that with both operating cash flows, cash on hand and the ability still to maintain a really strong balance sheet.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale"," ","Thanks. Next one for me is, you mentioned you\u2019ll be opportunistic in terms of portfolio management on the sell side. What about buying acreage or assets in the downturn?","Lee Tillman"," ","Well, I think as J.R. kind of mentioned, having that strength of balance sheet does give us the -- I\u2019ll say the horsepower to be opportunistic in the market whether the prices are up or down. It does allows us some flexibility to entertain opportunity. I think a great example of the type of opportunities that we\u2019re able to pursue is to add this quarter in the SCOOP area, which is a very accretive add, I guess 12,000 net acres to kind of 300,000 acre position. So in our view those adds will always be open to -- if they make sense and they reflect the quality that can come in and compete in our inventory. I think we\u2019ll always look to be opportunistic and consider those opportunities that present themselves particularly here in the U.S. unconventionals, because of the strength of our execution model and I think the credibility that we\u2019ve generated, I believe we have confidence in pursuing those opportunities. But again it will have to be something that can come in and compete with the quality of inventory that we have today. It really all starts in the ends with quality and having that running room looking forward to add significant growth opportunity in the future.","J.R. Sult"," ","John as we talked before, I think Lee\u2019s point is a good one. Whether we\u2019re in a $100 price environment or an $80 price environment or lower, the same litmus test applies. Now no doubt this sort of environment can create opportunities for those who could take advantage of those opportunities. But that natural tension in the capital allocation process still exists. It\u2019s still got to compete with those very high quality resource plays that we have today.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Look-forward to the 2015 outlook in December. Can you walk us through your fourth quarter expectations for wells drilled and online in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I think again, we were on track, on plan to deliver the guidance that we\u2019ve provided. Of course as part of last year\u2019s budget, we still remain within those brackets. So there's really no change in the activity outlook in terms of wells we expect to drill and wells we expect to bring to sale. So we\u2019re not singling anything different David than what we\u2019ve communicated in the past.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Okay. So no hard details as usual. Just trying","J. R. Sult","It's worth a try David.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","And then the 12,000 acres that you added\u2026","Lee Tillman","Maybe David, just to not dive that completely though, I think you\u2019ve seen our delivery in the three resource plays over the last three quarters. You\u2019ve seen the efficiency that Lance has referenced. So I think based on the activity level we have in our three resource plays, it\u2019s relatively straight forward I think to project that into the fourth quarter outlook.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","You\u2019re on track. And then the 12,000 acres, can you give any specificity or details on where you added the acres in the SCOOP?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I don\u2019t want to talk about the specifics on the acreage add, but just I think suffice to say that our view is that it\u2019s comprised a good core acreage that will compete going forward. The other element that we find very appealing in the acreage is that it also looks like it has prospectivity in the Springer formation, which we already have acres that are prospected in the Springer, but this would be in addition to that. And so we saw the Springer as a distinctive upside in this particular acreage position.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Just wanted to I guess follow up a little bit, maybe the details aren\u2019t available yet. But your Bakken re-completions, particularly you had mentioned the Hector and Ajax, 16 wells. Can you give us a little more idea of what exactly you\u2019re doing there, what you\u2019re hoping to accomplish? Maybe if there's any way you can give us any expectations for volumes and changes relative to where the wells were before or what they did originally?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Maybe few opening comments and I\u2019ll turn over to Lance. We\u2019ve got quite a large inventory of wells that were completed with our earlier technology in the Bakken, essentially single stage open hole frac designs. And we saw that inventory and we felt that there was a real potential there to go in and do recompletions to more modern multistage technology and generate not only uplift on IPs but also EURs. We started not surprisingly in kind of the best area of the field which was the Myrmidon area. We\u2019ve now moved into Hector and Ajax. The majority of what you\u2019ve seen this quarter is really Hector wells and that\u2019s where the majority of acreage lies. But maybe I\u2019ll let Lance just comment a little bit on what we\u2019re doing in the wells and how the team is driving, not only capital efficiency but economics in those wells.","Lance Robertson","Thanks Lee. Roger what you would find in terms of operational basis as we go into recomplete wells, we\u2019re going back into a drilling unit most of the time that has one or maybe two wells in it on a 1,280 acre unit. And we\u2019re going in to move to higher density full field development. Sometimes those wells are not using -- those original wells weren\u2019t using the best available technology that we understand today. And they\u2019re three, four maybe five years on production. So we\u2019re re-stimulating those wells to that modern best available technology as we drill and complete the rest of the wells on that pad for efficiency, all at the same time and to see those results.","We\u2019re having good success with that. We had it in Myrmidon. We're having equal success in Hector. We do not have any more inventory outside of Hector effectively today for those recompletions. But they compete for capital very nicely. And otherwise those wells and pads would have to be shut in for some period as we do the offset stimulations. So rather than having expense workover, this is an opportunity for us to re-stimulate those wells on a capital basis and bring the EURs up. So far the wells have performed very well and we\u2019re going to continue that program through the end of this year and pinning our capital evaluation into next year and we have about 70 more wells that are viable candidates.","Lee Tillman","Yes. And just to add to that, we do have a dedicated recompletion rig running in the field and that rig will essentially be liquidating that inventory over the next couple of years on a go forward basis.","Lance Robertson","I would say too that we\u2019re now far enough into it that even as we move to Hector and the reservoir quality may not be quite equal to Myrmidon, our efficiency of doing the recompletions, we\u2019ve gotten a faster as well as lower cost over the year which is really helping balance the returns on those.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks. And then sort of another way of asking the capital allocation question and maybe ways to lower spending commitments for next year. Key Largo I know the -- I guess that well's really maybe more of an impact on \u201914 CapEx but at 60% working interest, any efforts to cut that back, sell down a little bit? Or any of the other exploration wells for next year?","Lee Tillman","","Certainly Roger we look at the risk profile on all of these wells and make a determination on do we want to try to bring in additional partners to mitigate the go forward risk, particularly on some of these high-dollar wells in the Gulf of Mexico. So we're going to continue to be interested in looking at that risk profile on all of these deep Paleogenetype wells to ensure that we balance materiality versus risk in the well. So you will continue to see us pursuing farm downs when it makes sense to reduce our exposure on these wells. Because these are very dollar wells as you know. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","You guys operate in obviously a diverse of areas. Can I get some comments from you on what\u2019s been happening with service costs in your various geographies in the last let\u2019s say 90 days? In other words if there is a response on the cost side to the moves in the commodity market?","Lee Tillman","","Maybe I'll try again and then certainly I think Lance has already indicated that, at the beginning of the year we were quite successful in negotiating some very favorable commercial terms for our key service providers. And when you look at our business, particularly here in the U.S. it\u2019s dominated really by the supply chain, it\u2019s dominated our pumping service, our rig contracts et cetera. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our business here in the U.S. I think we were starting to see certainly some tightening in the availability of high spec rigs as we move through the second half of the year, but had not really seen a \"price response\" per se in the rig market.","So I think now going forward in this somewhat different commodity price environment, our expectation is that there will be opportunity for both operators at scale and we very much have scale in our favor that we'll be able to expand margin by getting in and driving much more favorable commercial terms, just given the significant magnitude of our book of business. ","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Small housekeeping item in relation to Atrush. Given the delay that of course you've because of the fighting in the region, I understand that construction there was postponed for a period of time. You're still guiding to start up in 2015. In any sense kind of during the year when that might be?","Lee Tillman","","I will maybe just make a couple of comments and then turnover to Mitch. We were certainly impacted by the security situation in Iraq. We were impacted to varying degrees across all of the blocks that we have interest, including our own operated block where we temporarily suspended operations on logistic one well, but there were also other operations on our non-operated blocks that were also impacted. But maybe I will just let Mitch comment specifically on Atrush but I do think it\u2019s important to note that Atrush from a net volume standpoint is still a very small component of our go forward portfolio.","T. Mitch Little","","Yeah thanks Lee and Pavel, good question. Clearly with the security developments in the region, several activities by various operators were put on hold or suspended. In the case of Atrush and the development of the Phase 1, a majority of that work is currently being done outside of the country. So that was able to progress. We had been expecting first production around mid-year. The team is working on developing recovery options and we're still in the midst of that process. So we can expect some impact from the security situation there but don\u2019t have a definitive timeframe nailed down until we work through the recovery plan. ","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay, but you are still firm on the 2015. ","T. Mitch Little","","That\u2019s correct. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Maybe this is a question for J.R. Obviously you all have gotten the proceeds of from the Norway sale and did indicate some intent to spend on some of the U.S. unconventional plays but J.R. could you talk about the -- looking at sort of the balance sheet in a lower commodity price environment, you've got that senior note I think coming due at the end of \u201915. Is there a certain amount of comfort level you're going to create by I guess warehousing some of those proceeds before that coming due?","J. R. Sult","","Well Scott, as we have said a number of times now, I sleep very well at night with the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility that that gives us especially in this slower commodity price environment. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily view that I am warehousing those proceeds for debt repayment. In fact if anything, I'd like to be able to put as much of those proceeds that we think make sense in this environment from a return perspective to work in our organic portfolio. And so I would have every expectation that I\u2019ll be refinancing that debt later in the year when it comes due in October of 2015. ","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investment. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","","I apologize, just a preamble if I'm being repetitive, because I knocked off Q&A for a little bit and got back on. You announced some [ph] Chalk results were identified as being within the previously announced delineated area. What\u2019s the status of magnifying that area beyond the approximately 155000 acres presently de-risked as you move into 2015?","Lee Tillman"," ","Well, I think thus far we have delineated about 18,000 net acres in the Austin Chalk and I would say we are on plan to not only continue the development, co-development of the Austin Chalk, but also to continue to delineate to the east and the west and maybe Lance, you could just add a little bit about the forward Austin Chalk program.","Lance Robertson"," ","Absolutely. Jeff we have four wells in the fourth quarter that will test new areas outside of the currently delineated area and combination will be east and west of that area and they'll test about 8,000 more acres that we view as prospective for the Austin Chalk. In addition to that in the Eagle Ford area, we also have two pilots that we've previously described to STACK n frac that will test a combination of Austin Chalk, upper Eagle Ford and lower Eagle Ford, up to four wells vertically STACK. Those pilots are also drilling today. Results will be roughly Q1 available, by the time they're all drilled and completed.","And we also have some standalone upper Eagle Ford tests that are also drilling today, but we haven\u2019t developed before and with those results likely first quarter as well. So we have a substantial amount of activity testing other vertical horizons as well as combinations of horizon and then those four wells that should test about 8,000 acres in the Austin Chalk. And again I didn\u2019t say that Austin Chalk was also. I think most of these are on pace all be drilled and start completions into Q4 and then first sales in early Q1.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment"," ","Okay, that was great color. If I could just clarify one thing that you just said, that the STACK and frac pilots, would you qualify those as being within presently de-risked acreage are they a part of de-risking the additional 8,000 acres that you saw to that?","Lee Tillman"," ","Those will be some about, actually. We\u2019ll have some outside the area and the majority inside that area.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment"," ","Okay and if I could ask one follow-up, a little bit higher level, it seems like condensate export momentum has slowed as that government struggles with methodology to accurately categorize condensate. What's your current view on how the condensate export market is progressing and what do you anticipate in 2015?","Lee Tillman"," ","Well, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily characterize it is as slowing down. I think that definitely there has been -- if you're referring of course to the BIS process within the commerce department, I think that has slowed a bit as we move through the elections et cetera. So I still view this as a very important issue for the industry. I think for Marathon specifically the one advantage that we have is that our Eagle Ford production is relatively heavy compared to other operators with the bulk of our barrels being heavier than 50 degree API.","And so we tend to see this as an issue going forward as those higher API condensate levels move up. But today it's not a hot pipe issue for us right now. Certainly we want to get high behind not only the lifting of the condensate export van, but also move toward lifting really of the crude export van fully and completely. We think that is really the long-term correct answer for the industry. But certainly if we see a progressive listing of condensate restriction, we want to make absolutely sure that we're positioned to take full advantage of that and the Eagle Ford team has definitely taken those steps.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment"," ","That\u2019s helpful and just to be clear -- and to your point, really what I was thinking of is the EIA has sort of been empowered to try to arrive at some sort of an industry agreeable definition on condensate based on API. So that sort of moves into wheelhouse, I think\u2026.","Lee Tillman"," ","Well, certainly it would be helpful as to the extent that there is a clear and definitive definition of condensate. I think that will be helpful for the industry.","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our last question comes from Mike Kelly from Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter Securities ","","I know its early days in the delineation of the Springer, but I was hoping to get your initial thoughts on how much of your 300,000 acres in Oklahoma could be perspective for the formation and also really get your sense on how the Springer could fare on a rate of return basis versus the SCOOP and the STACK? Thanks.","Lee Tillman"," ","I\u2019ll maybe just let Lance jump in on the Springer.","Lance Robertson","","Absolutely, so Mike, today we participate in about 11operated by other wells at our Springer and we see very high liquids rigs in those. It tends to be a lower gravity. And so I think what we\u2019re working on now is to see is it really an oil intuit reservoir or is it a retrograde condensate reservoir. We\u2019re very encouraged by the high liquids content to-date. It's little bit shallower than the existing Woodford. And so this is an opportunity continue to work on capital efficiencies there. But that liquids content been very high and high value products suggest that it should be able to compete favorably for capital on a go forward basis.","We will have our own wells starting in the Springer on operated basis late in the first quarter next year as we evaluate that. And by virtue of having a very core valuable SCOOP position, we also have a large part of that position as perspective for the Springer. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite ready to declare how many of those acres are perspective but we\u2019re encouraged by where we are and what we see because we\u2019ve been working on the Springer for some time now really almost a year and looking at. And so I think it\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for us to test in the future. And feel very comfortable it\u2019s going to have a chance to complete for capital.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Phillips for closing comments.","Lee Tillman","Before turning back to Chris maybe just a closing thought here. I very much believe that as a company Marathon is very well positioned to invest intelligently through the commodity cycle and certainly we\u2019re going to be using the optionality that we have across our opportunity inventory to not only maximize returns and growth but also retain flexibility as the market tries to find some equilibrium. And certainly we look forward to sharing more details on that later in December.","So with that I\u2019ll turn back to Chris to close out the call.","Chris Phillips","Thank you, Christine.

Let me add my good morning to everyone.","I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: costs; efficiencies; and execution, and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us well-positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement.","Rigorous cost control across all areas of our business is at the forefront of what we do each and every day, and the first quarter was no exception. We reduced our North America E&P production costs per oil equivalent barrel to $7.94, down 17% from fourth quarter 2014 and 28% below the year-ago quarter.","Operating cost reduction is hard work, and our teams have taken on that challenge. There is no one magic bullet, but rather, there's a diverse range of drivers within these savings. A few examples include more coordinated deployment of contract labor, focus on compressor utilization, aggregating water production into gathering systems and optimizing our chemical programs.","These types of savings are durable in nature and resilient to the commodity cycle. In parallel, we continue to work with our vendor base and supply-chain experts to take full advantage of our scale to drive commercial savings.","On the service cost side, we increased our year-to-date captured U.S. unconventional D&C service costs by an additional $25 million, bringing that total to $250 million. That represents a 17% reduction from our revised activity levels, and we fully expect to secure more savings as the year progresses.","And finally, on G&A, we have taken the necessary steps to scale our organizational capacity to match our activity level. And our first quarter workforce reductions are expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million.","During the first quarter, we have also made significant progress enhancing our returns through efficiency gains. Our high-specification rigs in the Eagle Ford are a prime example and delivered pacesetter spud-to-TD results of under seven days, drilling 2,800 feet per day, significantly above the quarterly average of about 1,600 feet per day. In the Eagle Ford, our EUR uplift was 26% for condensate wells and 79% for high-GOR oil wells, relative to fall of last year, while completed well costs have fallen about 15%.","Finally, we are reallocating more than $25 million of capital to the Oklahoma Resource Basin to further advance our understanding of the resource potential, which already stands at over one billion oil equivalent barrels on a 2P basis. We are complementing our two-rig operated program with incremental high-value, non-operated activity which is a very efficient way to maximize the benefits of our capital dollars.","From an execution standpoint, our teams had a great first quarter. We grew production from our three U.S. resource plays 11% over the prior quarter and 49% year-over-year. Our total E&P net production, excluding Libya, also posted strong results growing 4% and 20% respectively. All this was accomplished within our planned first quarter capital budget.","We recorded 98% average operational availability for company-operated assets during the first quarter, our most economic barrels. Yesterday, we announced a further optimization of our 2015 capital investment and exploration budget to $3.3 billion. This reduction is driven by a relentless focus on capital discipline and maintaining financial flexibility in this period of ongoing price uncertainty. We're adjusting activity levels to manage cash flows while still delivering on our strategic objectives and our three U.S. resource plays and with no change to full year E&P production guidance.","In addition, we are continuing our commitment to ongoing portfolio management regardless of commodity cycle and are targeting non-core asset sales to generate at least $500 million in proceeds. Portfolio management is simply part of what we do as an independent E&P company.","At quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.1 billion, which combined with our revolving credit facility, resulted in a total liquidity of $3.6 billion. And in May, we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the available capacity from $2.5 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity date to 2020.","Our 2015 capital program was always designed to be front-end loaded, and the first quarter of 2015 has been a quarter of transition. We are efficiently ramping down to lower activity levels in our U.S. resource plays and will achieve our target of 10 rigs by the end of second quarter.","Our current plan is to hold that activity level relatively flat for the remainder of the year, averaging a mid-teens rig count for the full year. But just to reiterate, our guidance of 5% to 7% year-over-year production growth for the total company, excluding Libya, and 20% growth for the U.S. unconventional plays has not changed.","With the enablers of lower costs, improved efficiencies and strong execution, our strategic objectives in the three U.S. resource plays remain in full force even at an overall reduced budget level.","We will continue our successful Eagle Ford co-development, expanding beyond the Austin Chalk to the Upper Eagle Ford in our stack-and-frac pilot. Our first quad stack and frac pilot, which includes one Austin Chalk, one Upper Eagle Ford, and two Lower Eagle Ford wells, is online and early performance is encouraging. We also placed five Upper Eagle Ford wells online in the quarter.","In Oklahoma, we are executing our two-rig operated program and brought five gross operated wells to sales this quarter, all in the SCOOP. We're also continuing to leverage the benefit of our high value outside operated program and plan to participate in approximately 50 of those wells this year in the SCOOP Woodford, SCOOP Springer and STACK areas, thanks to our reallocation of budget to one of our most prospective areas.","The capital we've reallocated to Oklahoma is primarily focused on increasing our non-operated gross well exposure. This increase in capital demonstrates our belief that Oklahoma represents an exciting growth opportunity for Marathon Oil that competes very favorably with our existing portfolio. We continue to advance our technical work here to be positioned to step up our activity as prices improve.","And finally, in the Bakken, we concluded our enhanced completion pilots and have incorporated the improved design into all wells drilled this quarter. Additionally, initial results from the first of our four down-spacing pilots are encouraging. The second pilot is currently online, but with fewer than 30 days, and the third just completed drilling. Our ultimate objective is to fully integrate the down-spacing pilot results with the now concluded completion design trials into our future development plans.","Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to reiterate that our strong operational execution, cost reductions, continued efficiency gains and capital discipline are enhancing our returns today, have us well-positioned for the current price environment and well-prepared for a sustained commodity price recovery.","With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we'd like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications. And you can reprompt as time permits. With that, Vivian, we'll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the strong operational momentum. And quick question on the Eagle Ford charts. I mean, I guess you did discuss it on the Q1 call but just a clarification. How much of the EUR improvement that you're talking about is kind of high grading and how much of it is due to completions performance?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Ed, it's a very good question, and I think you should look at it and both of the things you're referencing are important in that. First and foremost, the ongoing completions optimization we're doing is clearly driving EUR enhancement. As we work on stage density, profit loading, fluid loading and active diversion, we continue to see improvements on that side.","There is an impact as we focused in this year, particularly 2015, on a more focused area to deliver the highest returns in a lower commodity environment. So we are seeing some uplift from that. But I would encourage you to say it's principally driven by the completions efficacy we're pushing all across those basins. That's what driving the real EUR enhancement. And I think that's reflected if you even look at the early IPs, again driving that.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And a totally unrelated question, and we won't talk about the politics of what's going on in Alberta. But the oil sands, a very solid performance in the first quarter. Is that a sign of the sustainability that you were looking for or is that just a lucky quarter?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Ed, not just us but our partners and Shell as operator have worked very hard over the last several years, particularly the last year to two years, really working on the reliability system. I don't think we've seen enough runtime yet to say that's sustainable. But the signs are encouraging from our perspective. We really like the focus on operating expense, and we have more steps planned to work on that this year.","Certainly, the production is a sign that, in fact, this is the fourth strong quarter in a row of production deliverability out of that business. So I think we're on that road to improvement that we haven't been able to point to before. Again, I'd like to see more runtime, but I'm certainly encouraged by this past quarter and actually the past four quarters. That trend is headed in the right direction, and it needs to in this environment.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Lee, I wonder if I could \u2013 I don't know who actually who wants to take this one. But if I look at the results you posted in the Upper Eagle Ford, quite a wide range of 30-day IP rates there. I'm just wondering if those wells were all of similar design or if there's some obvious kind of variance between those that caused that? And maybe just give us an update as to whether you think the type curve is moving higher or if this is really more of a high grading in 2015? Then I've got a follow-up, please.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, maybe I'll offer a few comments and then let Lance weigh in. We're still in the early days of the Upper Eagle Ford co-development. I would say that we're still in the process of really delineating where the Upper Eagle Ford is going to be prospective across our acreage. And I think as part of that delineation, we will see some natural variability in well results as we test different things in that particular play.","I think overall, though, we're very encouraged from what we're seeing in the Upper Eagle Ford and in combination, of course, with the Lower Eagle Ford. And we're seeing similar strong results in the stack-and-frac of which the Upper Eagle Ford is a component part. Maybe I'll let Lance just comment on the completion design aspect of that.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Yeah, Doug. I think Lee actually highlighted it very well. We're testing Upper Eagle Ford in a more fulsome way, spread out over a fairly large area. So we're going to see some disparate results of that as we make sure we fully delineate it. I'd say those results are very much in line with Lower Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk in the same respective areas. And I would say what's most encouraging to us, the Upper Eagle Ford is working well in the areas where the Austin Chalk has worked a little bit less effectively. And so we see those two as increasingly interchangeable so we can co-develop in a broader area.","And very encouraged thus far on the Upper Eagle Ford both in that Northern end as well as in the stack and frac. I think, to be more clear, we brought on five Upper Eagle Ford wells that we announced that are distinctive. And in that stack and frac pilot that came online also includes a sixth or one more incremental Upper Eagle Ford well that's performing similarly.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","All right. I appreciate that. Lee, you obviously had \u2013 my follow-up is in the costs. You clearly had a very strong cost performance, and I think that's really characterized your tenure since you've been CEO. But I guess my question is, assuming we do get a recovery in the oil price, let's assume into the $70s or something like that, how sustainable are these cost reductions? Is it dynamic with an oil price recovery, or do you expect to be able to hang on to a lot of these gains? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Doug. We are very focused on cost, and I give a lot of credit to our asset teams. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, operating cost is just hard work. It's many things coming together to contribute to driving that unit cost lower. It's both the numerator as well as the denominator. It's working your absolute cost as well as making sure you're keeping your barrels online, and the teams did an outstanding job at that this quarter.","Many of those things, I think, in the operating cost side, though, are structural in nature. When you think about things around preventive maintenance and our ability to efficiently deploy contractors, when you think about efficiently using our installed compression horsepower, when you think about our optimizing of our chemical programs in the oil field, all of these things, in our mind, are independent of the commodity price environment. And we will carry those forward in time.","In parallel with that, though, we're not turning a blind eye to our scale and our ability to leverage that scale in commercial dialog as well. And some of those will be more sticky than others in some cases. But we do expect that we'll retain even an element of those commercial gains as we move forward in time. But those will have a much closer correlation with the pricing environment that we find ourselves.","On the capital side, when you think about the cost reductions we've achieved there, I mean, when you look at the $1.3 million of well in the Eagle Ford, the $1 million of well that we've achieved in the Bakken, the $600,000 we've achieved per well in Oklahoma, those capital efficiencies have, in large part, been driven by the response of the service industry to participate in this downturn that we're experiencing.","But even within that, there is a commercial element and efficiency element as well. Our most efficient frac crews can deliver a high number of stages on a monthly basis. That's a win-win for both the operator as well as the service provider. And our ability to keep those most efficient crews running, even with the downturn in activity, I believe, will be key to our ability to continue momentum as we see prices improvements in the future.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, Lee. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Great results. And if I could ask \u2013 maybe the first question is can you talk a little bit about the rationale behind the decision to drop the incremental rigs and what that means for the trajectory of 2015 production? Previously, you had talked about the U.S. onshore showing kind of an exit-to-exit incline. Is that still the case?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thanks, Ryan. Let me maybe start with the rationale around the further optimization and reduction in capital budget. I would really describe that decision and really driven by two things. First is just a continued focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility in a period where we still have uncertainty around the price environment, albeit, we've seen some strengthening here as of late. A lot of the macro factors that have driven the downturn are still in place, so we need to recognize that.","Secondly, with the enablers of both cost efficiency and cost reduction, we're still able to achieve our strategic objectives in each of the three U.S. resource plays and hold our guidance under that revised budget and drive those efficiencies and savings, really, down to the balance sheet. And if we start to see a sustainable price recovery, we can then reconsider if we want to take some of that cash flow and redeploy it into the business.","In terms of volumes targeting and trajectory, you mentioned that we had communicated previously an exit-to-exit in the unconventional target or unconventional production 4Q to 4Q, 2014 to 2015 slightly up on an exit-to-exit basis. And we still feel that that is consistent with the budget that we're putting forward today.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then maybe one follow-up on that. If we look at the normalized second half outlook, you've given \u2013 obviously, we have an updated CapEx budget and, like everybody else, you came into the year a bit hot. Can you talk maybe about what the normalized CapEx run rate looks like in the second half of the year?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me maybe describe it more from an activity perspective, and I think the capital will then kind of follow, Ryan. As we talked about, you used the word we came in hot. I think we recognized that we were going to come into the first quarter at high activity levels. We were coming out of 2014 with nominally 30-plus rigs running in the unconventionals.","We started that deceleration in activity in the first quarter and, in fact, our capital budget \u2013 we delivered essentially against our capital budget in the first quarter. But we did have a momentum effect as we came in from last year. That ramp-down is continuing. By the time we get to the end of second quarter, we'll be at our 10-rig count that we will hold flat for the remainder of the year, and that will set the activity levels in our unconventional plays.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And any idea of what the CapEx number is associated with that 10-rig program?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, again, if you kind of think about our $1.1 billion rate in the first quarter, you think about that in the context of our overall $3.3 billion budget, you put in the fact that we're relatively talking about a flat activity level from the second quarter forward, I think that you can back into the math in terms of what the actual rate will look like.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Portillo from TPH. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, all.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Hey, Matt.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a question around capital allocation thoughts. As you guys continue to see positive improvements in the SCOOP and STACK, can you talk about your capital allocation decisions as you think about heading into 2016 and how that may shift between the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Oklahoma asset base?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Absolutely. As we've talked in the past, we look at capital allocation down really to a type-curve level. And it is a competition for capital allocation amongst the three resource plays. Specifically, when we look at the SCOOP and the STACK, and we think about incremental cash flows becoming available to reinvest in the business, we're going to drive those to the highest return opportunities. Today, when you look at our single-well economics, that's really the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma.","And the highest quality of the Bakken, the Myrmidon, and as we integrate both the completion trial results and the down-spacing results, we'll see how those fare in the capital allocation decision. But there's no doubt that as incremental capital becomes available, that will be directed to the U.S. unconventionals and Eagle Ford and Oklahoma will be the strongest competitors for that capital.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just a follow-up to that question, you mentioned potentially north of $500 million in non-core asset sales. Just curious as you see a firming of the commodity price here and potential execution on those transactions, should we expect to see that redeployed potentially into the ground in the back half of this year heading into 2016 in regards to activity, or can you provide a bit of an update on how you're thinking about the capital allocation from those transactions?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first maybe just a few thoughts on the potential transactions themselves. In our view, portfolio management is part of what we do. It's an evergreen process. These are non-core assets that we're talking about, and what that means to us is that these are assets that are not going to compete for capital allocation and likely have higher value in someone else's portfolio.","This process would be going on irrespective of the commodity cycle that we find ourselves in because we think, again, these assets will have appeal to the right portfolio. Assuming success in those divestment activities, then we'll look at that at that point in time and see how constructive the price environment is and make a decision as whether or not we bring that to the balance sheet or redeploy it into our organic investment portfolio, which is very competitive.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the capital allocation questions. In SCOOP, STACK and Springer, you've reallocated capital there. But can you talk to your preference on balancing non-operated spending versus accelerating your own spending, and specifically, what the milestones you would be looking for between price, costs and well results for you to make a more material acceleration in your operated activity levels?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Well, first of all, the two-rig operated program, beyond delivering very profitable and competitive wells, is also allowing us to protect our pretty significant leasehold position in Oklahoma, over 300,000 acres. So that is an important element of our operated program and why we wanted to continue that commitment going into this year.","There's no doubt that there's been an activity uptick in Oklahoma in our non-operated portfolio as those folks that are multi-basin operators direct more capital into Oklahoma. We want to participate in the high-quality wells that that affords us because it simply expands the number of data points in our knowledge base around the resource potential that exists in Oklahoma.","Having said that, though, and kind of consistent with my previous comments, to the extent that we see a sustained strengthening in prices, that we see incremental cash flow come available. Oklahoma, our operated program, will compete very favorably for those incremental dollars.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then I have a somewhat nuanced follow-up to, I think Ryan Todd's earlier question with regards to how you are thinking about year-end. What I'm trying to figure out is or what we're trying to figure out is whether on a going-forward basis, you are saying you can do exactly the same as previously as we look into next year but with fewer rigs. And so I guess my question is with your 1Q having beaten expectations, you now have a little bit of a buffer to lower activity and get back to the same point in terms of year-end production that you were at before. Is that just the case, or is what you're saying, you're going to be on a growth trajectory from the year-end point that was no different with a lower rig count than it was previously with a higher rig count?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we want to make sure that we're well-prepared to reengage and ramp up in the unconventionals. Our base plan this year is to be at our 10-rig count by second quarter. We think that is the right answer from a capital discipline standpoint.","But we have the execution capacity to step into more activity as the macro environment supports that decision, and we'll be well-positioned to do that. And one of the advantages, of course, of holding on to our best rigs, our best crew, is that it does position you very favorably to step back in to that high activity or higher activity period.","So as we look ahead to 2016, we view that as an opportunity to start that ramp-up, again, assuming that we see that constructive price environment in front of us. And within our, of course, 2015 budget, we do have some items, some investments that will be either reduced or falling out of the 2016 program that will provide us a little bit of accommodation space even on a flat budget outlook going into 2016.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones from me. Could you talk more about the Rodo well in EG and what your plans are there?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, absolutely, John. We'll let Mitch take that one.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","Sure, John. Thanks for the question. We talked about in our 4Q call the two-well exploration program in EG. And we previously announced the non-commercial hydrocarbon results of the Sodalita well. We did fare a bit better on the Rodo well. But we now want to integrate the results of both of those wells into our regional database, look at the options to further exploit the other prospects in the area and understand what the commerciality options might be looking forward.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think just building on that, the EG program to us is a great example, though, of really infrastructure-led exploration where we have the investment there. These would be possibly smaller accumulations that we think that we have a unique ability to bring online and make commercial. But as Mitch stated, we still have some work to do to integrate the results from both wells before we're ready to move forward.","You had a second question, John.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. I did. I was wondering whether you think your current distribution is too high relative to the cash flow, your dividend, whether you need to address that going forward or given your current capital plan and asset sales that it's not an issue.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. John, this is J.R. How are you this morning?","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Good. And you?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'm good. Thanks. No, John, still, we've been pretty clear that when we think about capital allocation, that the dividend today remains in that pool of the first call on our capital. At the end of the day, the decision around the dividend is really the board's and not management. At this point in time, it remains that first call on capital. There's no doubt in a sub-$60 or $60 commodity price environment, that it pulls on our cash flows much harder than it did when it was just a year ago. But at this point in time, we're still committed to that dividend, John.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And our goal is, of course, to grow back into it.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Just curious on the production and reserves associated with the non-core assets.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just, we haven't detailed out specifically any granularity on those assets, but they're non-core. And for us, that means that they will likely be not significant from a volumes or resource standpoint.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Are they in you guidance or not? I guess if it's not significant, doesn't really matter.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah. Today, of course, we don't put any potential divestments into our forward guidance.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's helpful. And then thinking about cadence in each of your onshore resource plays and your second quarter guidance, can you break out some idea of expectations of how you maintain the Eagle Ford at a higher activity level, and then I guess Oklahoma next, and then what happens in the Bakken as you've slowed more rapidly there? Just trying to get an idea of production in each of those as you go through the year.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, just in terms of cadence or pace, it's really again driven by rig activity and frac crew activity. A case in point, David, we're already at a single rig of activity in the Bakken. But within that single rig capacity, we are very confident that we will still be able to deliver on our downspacing pilots, which was a key strategic objective for this year in the Bakken.","In Oklahoma, our two-rig operated program was largely dictated by our desire to ensure we protected all of our high-quality leasehold while continuing to develop the SCOOP area as well. And then of course, leverage, to the extent that we can, the non-operated side of the business to leverage our capital very efficiently.","And then in the Eagle Ford, it's really taking full advantage of some of the efficiencies that we are seeing on the drilling front and hopefully being able to extrapolate those moving forward into the second half of the year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I guess just to make simple math, if we take your gross operated wells in each area, subtract first quarter and divide by three, is that a rough approximation of completed well cadence?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it is a rough approximation because as we get down to that, we are a little bit in still that transitional period, David, as we come out of the first quarter where we're still kind of decelerating and ramping down. But as we kind of hit the back end of the second quarter, that really is setting the pace as we look forward into the second half of the year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's clear.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Does that help?","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah, yeah.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Hey, Guy.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Lee, I apologize for belaboring this point, but on the topic of pivoting back toward increasing activity levels, you've mentioned consistently that you want to see a sustainable price recovery before you begin to add rigs. Can you just talk a little bit more about what that really means and what you want to see? Prices are at $65 a barrel on the forward curve later this year. Do you need to see a higher price, or is it more of a duration question, or is it just a matter of you all becoming more comfortable with the macro internally?","And then relatedly, you mentioned a number of times you want to be well-prepared to re-engage. Are there any bottlenecks that you're aware of that could hinder an efficient ramp back up? And really just wondering, what risks you're most focused on mitigating in a ramp-up scenario and how you believe the company is well-positioned to ramp up whenever you feel that the time is right?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, let me maybe take the question on the price outlook and what we're really looking for there from a trigger point standpoint. And then maybe I'll defer the bottleneck question around our unconventionals over to Lance.","But on the question of what is the trigger, what are the signs that we're looking for to then give us confidence to begin a ramp-up in our unconventionals.","For us, you're right, the forward curve is looking around $65. I think if we saw sustainment at $65-plus certainly going into the back half of the year in 2016, to us, it's more about seeing that being a sustainable recovery and having the confidence to come back in and begin a ramp-up. But if we saw those levels, we felt that the macros were supportive and constructive of a sustainable $65-plus kind of a range, we feel very confident going into 2016 with a ramp-up in our unconventionals.","Let me hand over to Lance, though, to address more of the question about execution bottlenecks as we start thinking about a ramp-up in the unconventionals.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Guy, as we reduce activity, we have a clear focus on retaining the most efficient service providers, crews and equipment, which naturally creates an efficiency drive on our existing activity that remains. But it also positions us well as we grow.","We have existing relationships with those providers. Many of those are going to be the most equipped to bring equipment and people back into the sector on the growth side. So I think we're going to be comfortable there. And I think our drive to be really efficient is naturally a place where service providers would want to work for us before others. And so I think we'll have some opportunity there.","Having said that, I mean, we do have some concern that the labor force is leaving the energy space during this time, and it's going to make ramping up more challenging than ramping down. And I think that's something that, not just to us, but others will have to face in the market.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for the comments.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Guy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, if I may just pile on again to the same theme and just maybe take a different tact. As you look into ramping up if you do get a sustained price increase, would you all be willing to utilize your credit facility to do that, or do you have a tendency not to want to, I guess, add that to ramp up?","And if I can throw in my second question right away, maybe this is a good one for J.R. Is there any change in view on hedging because it looks like you've obviously now have some collars there with some floors. Can you just give us a sense of how that works into the equation?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Scott. You and I probably talked before. I don't think it's necessarily a change in view. We've always looked at commodity risk management much more broadly than just derivative usage. But I think we've been pretty clear and transparent that if we saw opportunities in the market to protect our cash flows while still giving us a piece of that upside in the commodity price, that we'd be willing to do that. And I think we've demonstrated it on a scale, at least, for 2015, as well as beginning to look at the 2016 market, all predominantly through the use of collars, again, to ensure that we're participating in that upside.","I mean, in terms of the balance sheet, again, arguably, I'm definitely leaning on the balance sheet this year, although I'm reinvesting the proceeds that we receive from Norway and those high-return North American unconventionals. And we've been clear that we are willing to lean, but we're not willing to stress that balance sheet. And so it definitely is a balancing act. But don't forget, when those commodity prices do improve or as they do improve, the rest of my portfolio, that 70% weighted for oil is going to also increase my operating cash flows that then will further support our ability to reinvest in increased activity.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And our next question comes from Monroe Helm from Barrow, Hanley Please go ahead.","Hiram Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC","Gosh. Almost got my name as bad as David Heikkinen. It's a good thing I'm not Monroe Heikkinen. It would really be bad. My question is just kind of a follow on to what the discussion's been here about increasing activity and a better commodity price environment. So if we look at the strip for 2016, it's $65. So let's just assume that the BTS, $65 for next year. I know you haven't done your budget for next year, but you got to have some sense of what your production profile will look like in a $65 world.","So I'm wondering if you can give us a very early outlook on what CapEx and what production might look like in 2016 under a $65 environment?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Luckily, it is a bit early from a budget cycle perspective. But of course, we're continuing to think about what 2016 may look like under various pricing scenarios. But I think under the scenario that you described, which is a confident $65 firm market going into 2016, in that sense, we could take a flat budget into 2016 and still have a ramp-up in the unconventionals due to the fact that we have other investments falling away in 2015. And that would, of course, be our plan. And then we'd watch for other signals in terms of how far we would want to go beyond that flat budget toward our ramp up in activity. But we can absolutely ramp up in the unconventionals on a flat three-three budget in 2016 in the environment that you just described.","Hiram Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC","What do you think \u2013 given that and this ramp-up in the unconventionals, could your production in the \u2013 can you give us a sense for what your U.S. production growth might be?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well again, it's awfully early to talk about volume-metric growth in 2016, particularly with the dynamics that we're experiencing in the market right now. But as we think about that flat budget and that ramp-up that it might afford in that $65 price environment, we could see 2016 average production looking not dissimilar to our 4Q 2015 exit rates.","Hiram Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Thanks, Monroe.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Monroe","Operator","And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. We haven't gotten a lot on international. So I thought I'd try a few on that front.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Excellent.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","In the UK, you guys obviously had interest in the past in selling the asset. But then couple months ago, we got a positive change in the tax treatment in the UK sector. So does that change your stance on whether this is something that you want to keep for the long run?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","Yeah, Pavel. Thanks for the question. As you said, we did entertain a marketing effort last year. We did not receive offers that we thought represented full value for the assets. And so we've taken the position that we're going to continue to operate those assets in the most efficient manner we can. And certainly, we're focused this year in this down environment on both commercial leverage, extending some of our scale with strategic suppliers from North America across there and some structural changes.","No doubt you've seen some of the equal time rotation work we're doing, which is decreasing our overall cost structure, focused on chemicals, logistics, all of those things. And of course, the tax reforms that have been introduced in the U.K. are helpful to us, but we're at a point in the asset life where they're not as material to us as they might be to earlier life assets.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's useful. And then on Kurdistan, I know that there have been delays for obvious reasons with the Atrush development. Are you incorporating any production from that field in 2015 guidance?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","Sure, Pavel. We had, in our original plan, had very minimal production from that asset. And as you've noted, we have been informed from the operator of some potential delays to first oil, which was previously targeted for the very end of 2015. We're working through that with them and understanding the forward plan on that and look to have further updates in the near future.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. But you're still committed to keeping that?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would just say, Pavel, just going back to our discussion around portfolio management that that's part of what we do. That includes our activities in Kurdistan as well. We'll test all assets for their fit in our portfolio. As you can imagine with the dynamics now in the KRG, even if we were to take a position of wanting to monetize those assets it might be relatively tough. But those are assets that when we look at the above ground risk, we'll need to consider their long-term fit in our portfolio.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Appreciate the color, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a little bit about the stack-and-frac. Can you talk a little bit about the actual configuration of that and if you were to move into a program, what it would mean for something like inter-lateral spacing within the lower Bakken? And then maybe talk a little bit about the cost-efficiency that comes from the process.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure, Jason. The stack-and-frac, we've defined it. I think, I can't remember the exact time we actually rolled that out. But if you look at the diagram we put out in our previous press releases, we're showing that as a four-interval co-development; four vertical intervals, which is Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford and then two wells in the Lower Eagle Ford.","We would actually broaden that to say that we'll have stack-and-frac pilots where there'll just be three, which is Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford as well as Lower Eagle Ford. So it's that vertical co-development.","We like the rates from all three of those horizons when they've been stacked. We announced that first pilot in that, and we have some additional pilots flowing. We'll be able to talk about those as they mature. But in terms of the efficiency you're referencing there, and this opportunity, we really like the efficiency because we're co-developing all of those horizons from the same pads. So we're spudding from rig to rig, and it gives us an opportunity to address those efficiencies.","So if you look at those pilots, what you'd see is that in most of those cases, it's 40-acre spacing in the same zone. In the Lower Eagle Ford, where we have two Lower Eagle Ford wells, it's 40-acre vertical, but it's really 20-acre between them. So it's like a chevron or a W pattern, if you will, in that lower Eagle Ford when you put two in there.","But generally, same zone 40-acre with the exception of that in the lower Eagle Ford, we actually separated into, here it gets confusing, the Upper Lower Eagle Ford and the Lower Lower Eagle Ford. Creative names, I know. So it's generally 40 acre with the exception when you put two in there in the Lower Eagle Ford, it gets to what's effectively 20-acre spacing, but they're offset in that pattern.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Thanks. That's really useful. If I could just ask one more question. There's been a lot of discussion about capital allocation over the course of the call in a low price environment. You've really had to take into stock what is important to you. I'm just wondering how deepwater exploration now fits into your future plans just given that, even if you're successful, the amount of capital that would be required for development and the rate of return on that may not even be competitive with what were you're doing onshore.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I think there, you're hitting upon, really, the contrast between the short cycle and the long-cycle investments. And to be fair to the deepwater, you need to look at it in terms of full-cycle returns as well not incremental returns.","So I guess, it really comes down to your view of that longer-term price outlook over time. If you take a view to where that longer-term outlook is constructive, then deepwater has a role to play in continuing to meet part of the future demand. And in our view, the high-quality deepwater assets still have the ability to compete in that longer-term environment.","I think the question for us becomes one of scale and cash flows and our ability to support the large investment dollars that are required in deepwater development. And so we're going to be very selective and very focused. This year's exploration program is half of the spend that we were last year. So we're going to bring a very sharp focus to that program that reflects the fact that these longer-cycle investments can have a role to play in your portfolio.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Good morning, Jeff.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","This is a great call. A lot of color. I wanted to ask you if you could provide a little bit more color on the Oklahoma resource non-op activity. And what I'm really wondering is is this just mirroring operated activity without the burden of adding a rig or does it present an additional opportunity to, perhaps, compress the learning curve on areas about which you have a less defined division?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Yeah, Jeff. It clearly accelerates the opportunities you're describing. We're learning an enormous amount from all of the offset-operated activity. That activity is predominantly focused in the highest values areas within the SCOOP and in the STACK where we have acreage. We clearly want to participate and capture that acreage and convert it to HBP. But we also want to take and leverage all of the early production, the petrophysics and the learnings we can have from that.","One of the things we really appreciate about the Oklahoma resource basins is we're getting several multiples of data from the OBO activity that we get from an operated activity for very few capital dollars. So we're learning tremendously at very low risk, really accelerates our description of the resource, of the well productivity and allows us to design our own pilots and grow and get ready to grow to scale activity much more rapidly.","I think our increase in capital spend in that area reflects that as Oklahoma continues to be resilient in the returns it can deliver, the activity in Oklahoma has also been resilient. And we're just responding to make sure we don't miss any valuable opportunities.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'll also just add that even though we're excited about the incremental information that can be gained from leveraging into non-operated, we have a very good understanding of Oklahoma. I mean, we have already greater than a billion barrels of oil equivalent and 2P resource ascribed to Oklahoma. So this is really just continuing to move that and progress that further and doing that in essentially a low price environment.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, let's take the same thing but think of it comparatively with the Eagle Ford. Following on your earlier remarks about well performance, was the decision to pull capital out of the Eagle Ford while increasing capital in Oklahoma an example of capital competition or was it more that Oklahoma offered a unique opportunity to increase activity without having to commit to another rig?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think it was, one, that Oklahoma does compete for capital very favorably. If you go back to our single well economics and you look at those even head-to-head with the Eagle Ford, those wells are on par. So strictly from an economic standpoint, absolutely competitive. But we saw a unique opportunity in Oklahoma, I think, as Lance very well described, to really leverage our money there to continue to expand our knowledge and insight around the Oklahoma resource basin. So we felt that was a unique opportunity. It's largely being driven by Oklahoma continuing to attract more capital from other operators' portfolios, and we want to participate in that.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good. Thank you. That was very clear.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Hey, Roger.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Quite a lot of this been hit. I guess I'd like to see if we could get any more clarity on what qualifies as non-core and is there any risk if a sale occurs this year that it would impact the production guidance? Or are we thinking about more the undeveloped, as you mentioned, competing with capital going forward?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Again, for a lot of reasons, we can't go into details on exactly what we would place in the non-core assets. But suffice to say, because of the definition of non-core, we view these as being not significant from a reserves and volume standpoint. So we would not view them as being highly impactful to our forward guidance.","And to the extent we're successful on those transactions, we'll communicate those clearly and transparently into the market. But for now, I think, suffice to say, we have identified a select list of non-core properties that we feel like will struggle to compete for capital, could potentially have higher value in someone else's portfolio. And we want to pursue those and accelerate those cash flows either to the balance sheet or for redeployment.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, it's fair. And I guess the last question I have is as you think about reducing rig count, reducing CapEx, maintaining production, and you're seeing different ways of testing wells and completion designs, is there anything you're doing differently in terms of choking back to production or anything like that to sort of smooth out? I mean, some companies are going for more the drill but uncompleted, build a backlog. Clearly, you're not in that camp. But I didn't know as we think about the exit rate for 2015 and all the discussion about CapEx and future drilling activity in 2016, if there was an incentive to sort of, let's call it, smooth out things a little bit as you set yourself up for the next up cycle.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Roger, we managed each of the individual wells to deliver the highest value in that investment. So we generally let the technical and operations teams manage those wells effectively. So rather than try this, for example, flow them on a smaller choke size and smooth that out. We're looking for highest value on that investment return today. The wells we're investing in this quarter are generating good returns at current pricing. So we have confidence we can do that and decisions we've really let the technical teams make.","We've scaled our activity in North America in logical increments that make sense. So for example, in the Eagle Ford, we want to keep whole frac fleets active rather than partial frac fleets to drive efficiency. We've scaled the drilling activity to match that. Part of the reduction we've taken in activity there is actually not just related to capital spend, but just recognizing as the efficiencies continue to improve, we were going to have to let go of one or more rigs anyway to make sure we didn't overdrill our plan for the year. And so we'll keep doing that.","I think as you noted, also, we have not been building a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells for use later in the year. We're really managing that as an operations basket of wells to complete to manage our stimulation operation smoothly and efficiently.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","And our last question is a follow-up from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I've got 10 follow-ups but I'll limit it to one. I'm surprised we haven't been talking more about the SCOOP and STACKS, so maybe people aren't quite as (59:00) as I thought. But let me ask you about when do you think you'll be able to give us an update, just in terms of timing, in terms of the well costs in a development mode? And then appreciate that the Meramec is quite thick up in the STACK, and obviously, you've got the Woodford spring occurred about an opportunity in the south. So the spacing could be really quite tight. So when do you think you'll be able to give us some updates on these spacing tests?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, when we typically talk about production results with you, Ed, we tend to talk about wanting to get 180 days of production to really understand well performance, understand where we are on a specific type curve. We are still on the learning curve in Oklahoma when it comes, though, to D&C costs.","And we think we're starting in a much more favorable position because of all the good work that has been done already in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to drive well costs down. We captured $600,000 in well costs already since we released our new well costs this year and our single-well economics.","But we think there's a lot more room to maneuver there from both an efficiency as well as a commercial standpoint. And that's just going to take some time as we grow to scale. Bear in mind, Ed, we had plans that had actually ramped up the six rigs in the Eagle Ford at year-end \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 in Oklahoma at the end of the year here.","And so the execution capacity is there. And I think as we move that to scale, that is going to allow us to really accelerate on that learning curve particularly when it comes to D&C costs.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. I was just trying to see if I could see if there was a NASCAR track in Oklahoma but so there'll be an Analyst Day at some point in the future.","Lee M.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Chris Phillips. You may begin.","Chris Phillips","Good Morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation's first quarter 2014 earnings call. I'm Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; and J. R. Sult, EVP and CFO.","As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release. You can find those remarks and the associated slides at marathonoil.com. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded, and our comments and answers to questions will contain forward-looking information subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Tillman","","Thank you, Chris. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the web cast. Prior to opening up to your questions, I want to make a few brief remarks on our first quarter performance. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by continued production growth across our U.S. resource plays coupled with strong realizations and lower exploration costs.","Our adjusted net income per diluted share increased to $0.88, up 73% from year ago quarter. First quarter of 2014 production available for sale from continuing operations excluding Libya averaged 440,000 net barrel oil equivalents per day and was impacted by an estimated 6,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day associated with extreme winter weather and by an estimated 14,000 net barrel oil equivalent per day related to lower reliability on non-operated assets.","Importantly, we have already advanced the three key priorities of our 2014 agenda; ramping up U.S. resource play drilling activity, marketing our North Sea businesses, and delivering shareholder value through opportunistic share repurchases.","We remain confident in our plans to grow production from our three U.S. resource plays by 30% in 2014 over 2013 as we aggressively pursue co-development opportunities for the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford, the Three Forks, and the Bakken, and vertically stacked horizons in Oklahoma.","We are committed to rigorous portfolio management to simply and concentrate our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin opportunities. The closing of the sales of our working interest in Blocks 31 and 32 in Angola during the quarter and the ongoing marketing of our U.K. and Norway North Sea businesses are evidence of this result.","We completed the $1 billion share repurchase tied to the Angola Block 31 sale; representing 29 million shares and in March, announced an additional $500 million share repurchase, which is now substantially complete. Upon completion of this additional share repurchase, there will be $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. ","We recognize the importance of delivering on our commitments quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. The first quarter delivered $1.35 billion in cash flow from continuing operations, 97% average availability in our operated assets, and 26% production increase in the U.S. resource plays year-over-year or 7% quarter-over-quarter. But our high-quality assets, deep inventory, capital discipline and demonstrated ability to execute, we look for continued profitable volumes growth to support the strong investment case for Marathon Oil.","We will now be pleased to take your questions.","Chris Phillips","Thanks Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we would like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications and you can re-prompt as time permits.","With that, Tiffany, we will open the lines to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","Yes, good morning and congratulations on the free cash flow that you generated in the quarter. I guess some of that probably was from the North Sea. Maybe talk a little bit about how you see the free cash trajectory of the company excluding the North Sea, assuming that you are able to sell that? Thank you. ","Lee Tillman","","Thank you Ed and good morning. Ed, as we've previously communicated, on a pro-forma basis, the North Sea businesses contribute about 20% of projected 2014 cash flow. Obviously we're watching the cash flows very carefully. As we look forward though, post the post the potential transaction. It's also important to recognize that both the Eagle Ford as well as the Bakken will be going cash flow positive at current activity levels in 2015. So, we remain confident in our go forward outlook and our ability to fund our investment program.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","And so switching to buybacks, I guess obviously waiting bids on the North Sea in the second quarter, but you've been pretty aggressive so far. Would you consider continuing to be as aggressive going forward? May be even sort of buyback ahead of the North Sea closing, given where the current share price is?","Lee Tillman","","Well, I\u2019ll just maybe for a moment talking about the North Sea, I just want to confirm that\u2019s a competitive process, it\u2019s moving forward per plan and we\u2019re still on the timeline that we\u2019ve communicated. Our main objective there of course are a full exit from the North Sea and of course delivering shareholder value there. When we talk about the buybacks, I would refer back it to our view of capital allocation. Share repurchases factor into that, they compete for capital. We\u2019ve seen some opportunistic share repurchases. I am not sure that I would call them aggressive, I would call them opportunistic. We\u2019ve looked at the returns that those could generate for our shareholders and have felt very comfortable with what we\u2019ve able to deliver in the share repurchase program. Going forward and assuming a successful transaction, repurchases will be part of the capital allocation consideration.","Operator","","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","Thank you good morning everybody. Hi, good morning Lee. I wonder if I could try to say a quick one on the running room on the co-development opportunities in the Eagle Ford, specifically obviously the Austin Chalk, are there any other spiked opportunities you see in that area? You've obviously given some pretty impressive well results, but we still don't have really any feel for what the scale of the acreage, what the scale of the running room could be ultimately for that development. And I guess the pace of development would come into that debate as well, if you could address those issues in the Eagle Ford, and I've got a follow-up please.","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely Doug, it\u2019s a great question. I I\u2019ve shared with several on the line. When we look at the co-development and we like to call it, of course we refer to it as the Austin Chalk, but I want to be clear that it\u2019s the Austin Chalk in conjunction with the Upper Eagle Ford being co-developed with the Lower Eagle Ford. That work is progressing. ","Last, I would say in 2013, our task at hand was really determining the viability of those zones, of the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford. And for the areas where we have wells, we have fully demonstrated that viability. ","2014 is really geared towards now attempting to extend that viability across our acreage position and the reason we haven't been out there with an update from a resource potential or well inventory standpoint is because we are still in that process of appraising the full potential of the Austin Chalk Upper Eagle Ford and as we complete that appraisal and then determine what that inventory is, we'll then flow that inventory into the prioritization of our full development plan of the Eagle Ford and that will ultimately dictate the pace.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","I appreciate the answer Lee, thanks. I guess as a follow up to Ed's question, the running room in the Bakken and the Cana and the Eagle Ford drove, those obviously anchor your production going forward. But how are you thinking about redeploying the potential proceeds of the Norwegian and U.K. sales assuming they complete? Would that be additional buybacks or would you consider adding another leg to the proverbial goose so to speak?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, I would say, obviously nothing is off the table, but I would go back to our capital allocation discipline Doug. As you say, we've got a deep inventory of growth opportunities across our three high quality U.S. resource play. Certainly one of the first calls on those proceeds would be looking to drive further accretive investments and across those three plays. ","In addition to that, we will look at selective resource capture opportunities as long as those opportunities can compete with the current inventory that we have in hand which is quite high quality. And then as you state, share repurchases may also factor in to that equation as well. ","So, we are not ruling out any options, but from a long-term shareholder investment standpoint, we feel very good about driving investment, further investment into our three high quality U.S. resource plays.","Operator","","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. ","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Can I just keep going on that Lee, I think that there is a perception that the asset base isn't strong enough to generate long-term growth, and that you kind of have to buy something. As I say, I know I'm hammering on the point, but I do perceive it to be the big overhang on your stock. Can you just keep coming back to this idea, I guess that you're not going to make a dilutive acquisition and that you believe you got the asset base to grow the company in a way that you think is attractive to shareholders?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolute, Paul. I want to be absolutely clear and in fact for those that participated in Howard Weil, we spend a good deal of time and effort trying to go through the complete resource base that we currently view in the three resource plays, which we feel is very compelling. We are looking at 2.4 billion oil equivalent barrels and in aggregate 10 plus year drilling inventory there. And as we look at further co-development down spacing stacked opportunities across those three plays, we see a path toward further enhancement in that two key resource base. So our confidence is very high. We in no way feel compelled or driven towards an M&A strategy that would be dilutive. Opportunistically, any type of resource acquisition, small or large has to compete against that existing inventory that we have today.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","And then if you could just update us on the Gulf of Mexico, what's Gulf of Mexico, what you're to and what's happening there and the outlook? Thanks a lot.","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely Paul. Well I think everyone is aware that we are bringing in the new build drill ship into the Gulf of Mexico this year. We expect to spud that in the third quarter that would be our initial inboard paleogene prospect which is the Key Largo prospect. We have got currently a 60% working interest in our operator of that well. So we are quite excited this is the rig that we are sharing 50-50 with another operator. In addition to that, we have the second appraisal well on the outside operated Shenandoah prospect, which is of course also paleogene in nature. And then finally, we are looking or have farmed into the Perseus prospect, as well in Desoto Canyon, and a well there is anticipated in the second half of 2014, and that is a [indiscernible] opportunity.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Paul.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Hey, good morning guys. So just keeping with the organic inventory theme. I know you answered questions on Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford, but also appears location upside from the SCOOP with your results. So I know, maybe it\u2019s a while early, I don't know if you could put any numbers around that potential or -- and just more details on these extended laterals, commodity mix, lateral lengths, IRRs and how that's stacking up competitively within your portfolio?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely. We are quite encouraged by the early results from our drilling program in the SCOOP. We communicated some 30 day IP rates from two SCOOP XL wells, which were again quite encouraging, good liquids yields, very good IP. ","But the real question continues to be is what's going to again be the long term EUR performance. And really before we start broadly communicating resource and inventory impacts at a minimum we want to be able to get enough production time to confirm the underlying economics of those wells. ","You might recall from Howard Weil, we had shared some indicative economics of SCOOP XL condensate wells and they were quite compelling when looked at our broad inventory. ","And based on the confirmatory results we've seen thus far, and our XL program, we see at least those types of returns and of course, those were done at a relatively modest flat pricing environment as well. So we are quite encouraged, as we've stated, we've got 100,000 net acres in the SCOOP, but we are methodically walking through our program there. We have got about 20 SCOOP wells planned for 2014 and the inventory this year, and so we hope to have a bit more results later in the year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Are you testing different length laterals? I mean the results that you reported were those a one-mile lateral similar to the Continental\u2026","Lee Tillman","","Yes, it varies in the SCOOP; we vary between one mile to two miles, a lot of that will be dictated by geology or by the lease configurations that we are confronted with. Sometimes we're not able to do this full XL length and we'll scale accordingly. So, you may have some XL minuses and some XL pluses in there.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Right and then in the commodity mix you mentioned condensate, but is there any more detail through the different windows there, just curious where you are drilling?","Lee Tillman","","Yes well we expect there to be some variability that's -- we wanted to provide those -- some indication of liquids yield and that's why we show that 66% to 70% liquid yields on the two wells that we communicated, and that's the type of economics that would look very attracted to it and compete for capital allocation.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","And maybe just lastly from me. So, do you think it's through this 20 well program that you'll -- once that's complete, you'll have a better view to express a location number, resource number similar to what you did in December to see what the upside might be from what you disclosed there?","Lee Tillman","","Certainly, we will have more data and I think we will have more data, and really two areas; one is on the resource and performance side, what type curves are we really observing in the wells. Really, to confirm these economics you truly you need about 180 days of clean production to really get the underlying type curve define. But the other pieces is also that you have to bear in mind, is it will also be gaining information on where we can drive capital efficiency on the D&C side as well. So it's really those two elements coming together that will ultimately dictate the resource sides and the number of inventories that we see, but we'll have a lot more data at the end of the year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great Lee. Thanks for the answers. ","Lee Tillman","Thank you Evan.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. You may go ahead. ","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company ","","Good morning everybody. My first question was on the capital spending during 1Q came in lower than we had modeled, lower than the rate implied by the full year guidance. You guys ramped up to the 28 rig program fairly early in the year, and we have been expecting pretty consistent levels of activity this year. So, just curious as to how the 1Q CapEx came in relative to your internal plans. Are you guys tracking below budget, and may be seeing some better than expected cost savings and efficiencies or did you have some weather influence 1Q and is the spending just going to be a little bit -- will just build as we progress through the year?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, great question Guy. Let me take that one head on. We are down on run rate in the first quarter and let me give you the rationale for that. One is we had fewer wells to sales, fewer completion in the Eagle Ford and that was largely driven by the learning curve of three new rigs, the increased density in our pad drilling moving from notionally three to four and also extending the lateral length on our well mix. So, less completions of course, less cost. ","The bigger element though was the timing and phasing of some of our major project span, and so I'll emphasize that\u2019s a timing factor. We\u2019re not predicting that we will not spend our full capital budget for 2014. Specifically we had some expense well work that ran into 2014, displaced some of the capital work that needed to occur on the Boyla project that will now be a bit later in the year, and that really was the project element, was the main driver. But our expectations of course is that, that is simply a timing element.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company ","","Okay very helpful Lee. And then my follow-up was, I was just hoping you could provide some more information if available, with respect to what you are seeing on the Bakken down spacing initiatives, how the four pilot locations are progressing in your core areas? Any color that you might have there.","And then also, could you talk a bit more about the even higher density spacing that you have planned for later in the year? What's the timing on that? When would you expect to be in a position and to maybe communicate some of the comprehensive results from that program and what it might mean to your view of the resource potential there?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, good question. As we mentioned before, we are at the early days of the 320 acre spacing test and we refer to these as high density pilots because essentially we are combining eight wells there, four in the Middle Bakken, four in the Three Forks, one 1,280 DSU. That work is progressing. We continue to see encouraging results. We don't have any new data to share. We had shared a bit of where that -- where those cumulative oil curves were progressing in the Howard Weil and we don't really have a material update on that. We are though progressing into the higher density pilot where we're looking up to 12 wells, for 1,280 spacing units; and those will not really be spudded until the second half of 2014, and will be in both the Myrmidon as well as the Hector areas.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you very much Guy.","Operator","","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","","Thanks good morning. Just wanted to come back to the questions on the Eagle Ford regarding the -- as you mentioned, the increased number of rigs, the density and all that and then, you maybe commented on the transcript about needing to rebuild your uncompleted well inventory. Could you just help us understand, may be how that either already has or will affect kind of well completions production growth as we looked over the next couple of quarters?","","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely. Good question, Roger. We did mention that there were a few factors impacting our wells to sales in the first quarter in the Eagle Ford. And again just to review those, those were essentially the movement to higher density pad drilling, a bit longer laterals, which again -- that's a great value proposition for us. We're doing that because it's creating more present value on those wells. ","And then finally, as you say that the learning curve of bringing incremental wells into the fleet. What I will say is that if you look at the total wells to sales in the first quarter which was 49, for the full quarter, to give you some confidence going forward that we have now crossed that bridge and rebuilding inventory for the month of April, we've already brought 26 wells to sell in the Eagle Ford in the month of April. So, we are back fully on track for moving into the second quarter.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","","And as we look out Q3, Q4, the run-rate of say in April or Q2 overall should be more indicative than Q1, or are we kind of in a -- little bit of a sign curve ups and downs here?","Lee Tillman","","No, I think at this stage, we're looking at -- the second quarter should be much more of an indicative rate for us in terms of wells completions. We'll again have some runtime with the new rigs. The well mix may continue to create some lumpiness as we now have longer laterals. And certainly our density in pad drilling is going to continue to move even from before to higher numbers, which does create some lumpiness, and particularly as you get around the transition quarter-to-quarter depending upon when some of those well pads fall, could impact the number of wells to sales because you're now talking four, five, and six wells that could trip from one quarter to the next.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","","And then my last question. The OSM, another kind of bumpy quarter here. It's not unusual for that category for anyone. You've been pairing assets that haven\u2019t necessarily met your long-term criteria. Can you walk us through the thoughts on OSM? Given its challenges, given the discounts in general for Canadian crude, how that sort of fits in with everything. Is it something that you want to fix or it might be better off in someone else's hands?","Lee Tillman","","Well, certainly first and foremost we want to fix the OSM's performance. It is a high-quality mining asset. It has suffered from very challenged reliability, which has created an inconsistency in the returns that it does deliver. It is a very large resource base for us. We have about 600 million barrels in reserves associated with our interests in AOSP. In terms of how does it fit in our portfolio, I would say we have no sacred assets. I\u2019m not going to speculate on future strategic divestitures, but we will test all of our assets in terms of their long-term fit and we\u2019ll take it from there.","Operator","","Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. You may go ahead.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","","(Indiscernible) that you're pleased with the Eagle Ford performance being above type curve. How much above type curve are the wells doing? Are you changing your designs at all? Are you putting in more profits or increasing frac density?","Lee Tillman","","Well, our completion designs continue to evolve and improve and as we \u2013 again as we talked about at Howard Weil quite extensively, the movement and completion designs have essentially offset any impact that we might have foreseen in the down spacing moving down to 40 acres. So the completion of the design continues to be an iterative process where we continue to improve the value proposition. We look at all elements of completion design; proppant loaded, fluid loading, stage spacing, a number of frac stages, the type stages that we're using and pumping. And here is where we really benefit from the competitive aspects of the service company; really bringing the best and available technology to the completion side. So the designs do continue to move, do continue to improve.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","","With Key Largo, are you going to go into the well with 60% working interest or are you going to farm it down more?","Lee Tillman","","Well, we'll take just like any of these deep water Paleogene prospects, we\u2019ll look to see if it makes sense to manage risk further. Our view is we want to maintain a materiality and operatorship, but certainly we would not rule out the potential to bring in the correct partner if we saw that as an opportune chance to mitigate risk.","Operator","","Our next question is from Amir Arif from Stifel. You may go ahead.","Amir Arif - Stifel","","First question on the Eagle Ford. The six Austin Chalk wells that you do have, can you just give us a sense of how this 30-day and the type curve so far compares to the lower Eagle Ford wells in the same region.","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely Amir. We've shown this before in previously released data, but when we compare to a lower Eagle Ford, 40-acre type curve, we\u2019re seeing very analogous performance. In some cases, even the Austin Chalk performance is moving ahead of the 40-day Eagle Ford. So there's variability there but we're very encouraged that the Austin Chalk Upper Eagle Ford completions are quite competitive with the Lower Eagle Ford, and more importantly in the co-development scenario, we see those two zones behaving independently and we see no impact or interference -- negative interference from the Austin Chalk Upper Eagle Ford completions.","Amir Arif - Stifel","","And then, so there's no pressure drop that you're seeing on those wells relative to the other existing wells?","Lee Tillman","","Correct. We haven't seen any issue with the co-development scenario cannibalizing the Lower Eagle Ford production.","Amir Arif - Stifel","","Okay. Then the second question is just on the Oklahoma Basin. The 100,000 acres you have over there, is that just the SCOOP and if that's the case, can you also outline how many acres you do have in the stack, and how many acres in the Granite Wash or the Mississippi play?","Lee Tillman","","The 100,000 acres simply refers to our SCOOP position, our net acreage in the SCOOP position. We haven't given out specific acreage, but overall we have about 210,000 total acres in the Oklahoma Resource Basins. But bear in mind that things like the Southern Mississippi Trend and the Cana Woodford are stacked with one another. So there are components of that 210,000 net acres that are in core stacked potential as well as things like the Granite Wash.","Amir Arif - Stifel","","And have you tested the stack still?","Lee Tillman","","We currently -- as we mentioned in our press release, we continue to test other horizons in the Oklahoma resource basin. Specifically we have two operated wells that are producing in the southern Mississippi trend and we have in fact brought online the first of two Granite Wash horizontals. And again Granite Wash is a bit of a redevelopment of a field that was vertically developed. And we do have additional wells in the Southern Mississippi trend schedule to spud in the second quarter of 2014.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. You may go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","First on Kurdistan. As you are getting ready to begin production on Atrush in 2015, is there a clear framework for the off take on that? And on a related point, do have a sense of where crude pricing is going to be relative to benchmarks?","Lee Tillman","","Maybe take the off take question first. Kurdistan, the Atrush development, which is a PACA-operated development, we\u2019re looking to have three wells that will be producing about 30,000 gross barrels per day with first oil in 2015. The original field development plans were predicated really on truckable volumes because that was the export solution of high confidence. As the discussion continues between Erbil and Basra we know that there are Kurdistani barrels in Turkey today. They have not been brought to the open market as of yet. But if there is a resolution there, then clearly the path we would like to pursue would be linking into more of a pipeline export solution. It gives us much more flexibility, ensures flow assurance, and certainly would allow us to ramp up additional phases more readily in that scenario. Realization wise, I think our view would be hopefully driving those towards benchmark pricing with some discount based on the location. It would be a brand index type pricing.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Okay. And then just on your exploration program, given the calendar you've laid out in the press release, it looks like Q2 will be or maybe second half of Q2, first half of Q3 is going to be the most kind of high-impact period of 2014 in the program. Is that a fair characterization? Is it just kind of concentrated this way?","Lee Tillman","","Well, absolutely. We would certainly be getting some well results in 2Q that will be very important. We will be in the testing and TD phase of the Jisik-1 well, which is an important operated well. It's a follow-up to our discovery, the Mirawa-1 discovery on the Harir Block. We will also see results from the Sala-1 well in Kenya and the Shimela-1 well in Ethiopia. Most of the other activity will be a bit more back-end loaded in the year. But I certainly don't want to minimize the importance though of that inventory relative to forward performance. So that includes the operated Key Largo, as well as two potential operated wells in Equatorial Guinea from an exploration standpoint. So yes, 2Q is important to us, but certainly the back-end of the year and the wells we'll be spudding then are equally as important.","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. You may go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","The first question I wanted to ask was on the Bakken re-completions that you announced in the press release. I was just curious to know something about the costs and also what were your production expectations prior to the re-completion?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, absolutely. We have progressed our Bakken re-completions program. We've delivered five wells there thus far in the first quarter. That program will continue through the year. We do have initial 24-hour and 30-day IP rates in hand and those are certainly exceeding our original funding expectations. These are though full re-completions. These are not re-fracs. So you are essentially re-completing and re-fracturing the well, bringing it up to current technology levels. These are wells that were originally completed with open-hole single-stage gravel packs or frac packs for the most part.","So we're bringing those up to current technology norms. The ranges that we're seeing for these re-completions are between $4 million to $4.5 million. As we get a bit more cumulative production and can confirm the economics, we'll come forward with that and share it a bit more broadly. We're just a bit still in the early days. I would also mention that the initial recompletions have been in what we consider to be the highest quality area of the Myrmidon. We're now extending that into the Hector area as well, and when you look at that 100 well inventory that we quoted at Howard Weil, these are important tests to see just how much of that inventory will be within the economic window.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","Okay And just to make sure that I have a little idea what we\u2019re talking about --you\u2019re talking about maybe going in and taking an open-hole well and maybe doing a cement liner and plug-and-perf, that kind of stuff that we see evolving in the new wells in the Bakken. Is that where we\u2019re getting at?","Lee Tillman","","Yes. But basically, we\u2019re taking lease wells and re-completing them using the best available fracturing technology that we\u2019re applying on our new drill wells, which for us maybe sliding sleeve type completions, whatever we feel is the best completion for that area at the Bakken.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","And sticking with the Bakken, I just wondered if you have any update on your lower Three Forks bench tests, and if not, when might you have something more to share?","Lee Tillman","","We\u2019re still very much in the early days of the Three Forks lower benches. We've had great success of course in the first bench. I believe we reported numbers that we have a little over -- 20% of our production is in fact coming from the Three Forks first bench. We have plans to initially focus in the Myrmidon area, and we've got about six wells currently planned for late 2014, early 2015. Permitting is currently in progress. The data we will get more in the near term is from some of our working interest participation and some OBO pilot projects. And those we talked about quite extensively at Howard Weil. And we\u2019ll take that data, and of course use it as we look at developing our own inventory on the operated side.","Operator","","Thank you. Our last question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","Just a follow-up. In the past, I guess you've given us some sort of instantaneous rates. I know they are not very helpful for us in Eagle Ford, but just to give us a sense of actually seeing it in the numbers. I appreciate all the color you've given on wells to sale, but maybe some color on current production in the Eagle Ford?","Lee Tillman","","What I would tell you Ed, is that we remain on plan in the Eagle Ford to deliver our targets for the year. We're at or above 100 KBED in the Eagle Ford. Again, because of the number of wells to sells in the first quarter, that dampened a bit the production for the first quarter, but we still had good growth quarter-on-quarter, 7% even with that number of wells to sales. And as I mentioned, with the pace that we're on for the remainder of the year, we feel very confident in our Eagle Ford growth rates for 2014.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","And then this is in my opinion, noise, but it's important for some folks, the 213 [ph] for the U.S. production came in below the guidance that you gave, I guess, in February. I appreciate that's only a month and a half of data. What do you think went wrong to drive the guidance below the bottom-end of the range in U.S.?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, I think we're pretty explicit on that one, Ed, and I appreciate you raising it, which is we did have pretty significant weather impact in North America, not only on our current base production, but we had pretty dramatic impact on our ability to do our D&C activities in the Bakken. And when you look at that in aggregate, it would absolutely have delivered us at the midpoint of the range. So it was a bit of external impacts that were out with the asset team's control that impacted not only production but activity levels as well.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","So a little bit more contingency in the winter months I guess going forward in hurricane season?","Lee Tillman","","Yes, it's a little bit tough, because even though we\u2019re very accustomed to severe weather in the Bakken, this has been an anomalous winter even by Bakken standards. And our inability really to run the frac crews and even sometimes get to location put a very large challenge on us in the Bakken.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","And then finally, just on the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford co-developments, obviously you've put type curves into the Howard Weil presentations, which reflect your geological view of where those wells will go. From the outside, you can get data off the Texas RRC, but that doesn't give day\u2019s downtime. It just shows you what the actual production is from the wells. And we\u2019re observing that the cumes on some of those wells are less than the cumes that you\u2019re seeing on sort of Eagle Ford stuff that's close by. So, maybe just a little bit of color on, I mean is it just \u2013 as you are testing that, perhaps these wells aren't up as much as they would normally in a full development mode.","Lee Tillman","","We certainly have not seen anything in the wells that we have brought online that caused us concern relative to the type curve. We have quite a few of these wells now that have pretty extended days on production some of them are approaching 250 days and plus. So we're very confident. We outsourced some of the \u2013 the older Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford wells that have cumed quite well. So, our confidence still remains quite high, Ed, in the areas where we've tested the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","The fear people have is the decline rate, because some of the earlier Austin Chalk tests in different parts of the Austin Chalk and I get that the shale is more like a shale in your area, but had higher decline, so that's why people look at it.","Lee Tillman","","No, understand and also I think people are also tainted a bit by their view of the more traditional Austin Chalk as well. As we\u2019ve stated, there are some fundamental technical aspects of the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford in our acreage position that make it pretty unique. One, it\u2019s in direct contact with the Eagle Ford reservoir; two, it's got its own organic content. So it's somewhat self-sourcing. And so coupling that with the well performance that we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re quite comfortable, again in the areas where we have cumulative production.","Operator","","And we have one final follow up question from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. You may go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","Going back to the Austin Chalk. I just wanted to ask you, what was the reason for the rate restriction on the Children Westin well?","Lee Tillman","","On that point, Jeff, we are using our similar choke optimization process that we use across the field that we think balances present value versus ultimate EUR. So we\u2019re very comfortable with our choke optimization process that we have in place and we want to ensure that we don't damage the reservoir for its long-term performance. And again, we feel very comfortable, we've got enough experience with the Lower Eagle Ford and the appropriate way to manage choke that we\u2019re extending that process into these Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford wells.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","I was familiar with your program. I just wanted to make sure that it was a voluntary choking and not maybe \u2013 (indiscernible).","Lee Tillman","","No, absolutely. The 16\/64 is our typical approach on choke optimization and there's nothing more to read into that.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","","Okay. I wanted to ask you one other final question with regard to the Austin Chalk and what I'm really thinking of here is Slide 10 from your Howard Weil presentation, where you showed a selection of acreage and then you had some colored dots that showed the difference to Austin Chalk, vintages and where they were drilling. Can you characterize just on a percentage basis, what you see as the potential -- the percentage of acreage that's potentially perspective for the Austin Chalk and I don't know if you think you've had enough wells yet, but has some percentage of that perspective acreage been delineated by the drilling you've done to-date?","Lee Tillman","","Yeah, I would say, we're still in the very early days. That map that you refer to was illustrating us walking around our acreage position from an appraisal standpoint. The positive is, as we talk about the next set of wells, bear in mind that we've got two Austin Chalk wells that are waiting on completion right now and we have three more pilot groups that have a total of six Austin Chalk wells in them that are currently drilling. And what I will share with you is that that those tests will take us to the North and to the East, which will help us further delineate that acreage position. So I think we\u2019ll have a lot of excellent data to share a bit later in the year as we complete that pilot work. But we're staying with that plan as we described at Howard Weil.","Operator","","Thank you. And that was our last question. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Phillips for closing remarks.","Chris Phillips","","Thank you, Tiffany. We appreciate the questions and interest in Marathon.

I\u2019ll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lee, who will provide his opening remarks. We will then open the call to Q&A.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Guy, and thank to you to everyone joining us this morning. First quarter marked a continuation of our track record of successful execution against our well established framework for capital. This framework has been our touchstone as we have transformed our business to our advantaged multi-basin U.S. resource play model.","It starts by ensuring every dollar we spend advances our corporate returns. This returns-first mindset coupled with disciplined capital allocation resulted in a peer-leading year-over-year improvement in cash return on invested capital in 2018. We are well positioned to continue driving this significant rate of change in both our cash return and cash flow per debt adjusted share. From 2017 to 2019, our cash returns are on pace to almost double oil normalized pricing. ","It also means prioritizing sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing, over-production growth for growth\u2019s sake, while driving our peer-leading enterprise breakeven lower. In first quarter 2019, we have already generated $80 million of organic free cash flow. Our organic free cash flow is expected to improve in the second quarter and over the course of the year, driven by our underlying operational momentum and amplified by a more favorable pricing environment.","With sustainable free cash flow, capital discipline for us means prioritizing the return of capital back to shareholders through both our peer competitive dividend and disciplined share repurchases. As a compelling proof point, in 2018 we returned over 25% of our net operating cash flow to shareholders. 2019 year-to-date, we have repurchased $50 million of our shares, and including the dividend have returned over $90 million to our shareholders. Organic free cash flow generation remains the governor on potential buybacks. We simply will not spend money that we have not earned, nor will we be reliant on disposition proceeds.","We continue to see good value in buying our shares at current prices, consistent with our returns focus, and with organic free cash flow inflecting higher, we expect our capacity for additional share repurchases to trend upward, allowing us to take advantage of our remaining $750 million authorization. ","Finally, capital discipline is about differentiated execution that drives continuous improvement in capital efficiency and operating costs while also enhancing our resource base. In 2018, we held to our original development capital budget while raising our U.S. resource play oil production guidance three consecutive quarters, and uplifting our inventory through organic enhancement efforts in both the Bakken and Eagle Ford. ","For first quarter 2019, our development capex is down 8% from year-ago quarter and represents just under 24% of our full year 2019 development capital budget. We are firmly and credibly on track to achieve our full year oil growth guidance with no change to our development capital budget. As we have consistently demonstrated, our budget is not a suggestion, it is a commitment, and we will not increase spending on improved prices to chase growth; rather, we will take that cash flow to the bottom line and share it with our shareholders. ","Expanding further on our differentiated execution in the first quarter, U.S. product unit expense was down 12% from year-ago quarter and we are seeing lower completed well costs across all basins while still delivering strong well productivity. These four objectives - corporate returns first, sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing, prioritizing return of capital to shareholders, and differentiated execution are how we run our business and are embedded in our executive compensation. They are supported by a foundation of our multi-basin portfolio and peer-leading balance sheet. We have concentrated and simplified our portfolio into four of the best high margin U.S. resource plays that span the development cycle in terms of maturity, providing capital allocation flexibility, broad market access, diversification of suppliers, and rapid sharing of best practices. Our current resource base is high return and high quality, and we are progressing multi-faceted efforts to continue to enhance it. As such, large scale M&A is not a consideration, nor is it required for our forward success. ","Our balance sheet provides tremendous financial flexibility to execute our business plan across a broad range of pricing, and with the recent upgrade by Moody\u2019s we are investment grade at all three major rating agencies. ","With our framework for success as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn our attention to a few of the more specific first quarter highlights across our multi-basin portfolio and how each of our assets are individually contributing to our collective enterprise-level success. ","First at a high level, total company oil production was up 6% from year-ago quarter with U.S. oil production up 11%. Though we delivered within our quarterly production guidance, our results would have been even stronger without the impact of adverse weather effects across multiple basins during 1Q, especially severe during February in the Bakken; however, our D&C execution was unaffected and our well productivity was strong. Our only challenge was keeping our well capacity online. Importantly, we are carrying that developed well capacity into second quarter, as seen in strong April performance, and have good operational momentum that supports our expected 5% sequential growth in U.S. oil production for 2Q. We remain firmly on track to deliver our full year plan of 10% total company oil growth and 12% U.S. growth within our original $2.4 billion development capital budget.","In the Eagle Ford, due to consistently strong execution and advantaged pricing, our team continues to deliver financial returns and free cash flow that compete favorably against any basin across the lower 48. During first quarter, we drove further efficiency improvements from already impressive levels. Our completed well cost averaged just $4.4 million, down more than 15% from the year-ago quarter, while our completion stages per day and drilling feet per day were up 15% and 10% respectively.","In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading well productivity while realizing step changes in capital efficiency and associated bottom line returns improvement. More specifically, our 180-day cumulative oil production per well for the last two years is outperforming the peer group average by a significant 45%. We are delivering this leading productivity while continuing to drive our well costs lower. During first quarter, our average completed well cost was just $5.1 million, down more than 25% from 1Q18. ","At the same time, we remain focused on continuing to enhance our resource base through both organic enhancement efforts and also through small bolt-on acquisitions and leasing. We are pleased to provide a positive update on both fronts as our fourth quarter core extension test in our Ajax area of the Bakken, where we hadn\u2019t drilled for three years, is delivering truly impressive long term production, and we recently added over 50 new gross company operated locations to our position through a bolt-on acquisition and incremental leasing.","Turning to Oklahoma, we again reported strong and predictable results and optimized spacing designs in the over-pressured stack, where average well performance for our three first quarter in-fills each developed at DSU-specific spacing is outpacing our tight curve by over 50%. The team also continues to drive our well cost significantly lower, improving bottom line returns with average completed well costs per lateral foot for our first quarter stack in-fills down more than 30% relative to parent wells. ","In the northern Delaware, we continue to strategically pace our investment with a keen focus on protecting our leasehold, delineating our position, and improving our margins all while delivering significant early development drilling success. Well productivity in Malaga has improved markedly as we advance our learnings, highlighted by a four-well pad that delivered an average IP30 of over 2,800 Boed at 62% oil cut, or approximately 400 Boed per 1,000 foot of lateral. Importantly, we also continue to make great progress in reducing both our capital and operating costs. We have made considerable progress in getting our produced water on pipe and will be at 100% water on pipe for our remaining 2019 wells to sales. ","Stepping outside of our four U.S. resource plays, we had a very busy quarter on the international front. We successfully executed our planned triennial turnaround in EG with a return to full production levels achieved on schedule in early April. As previously announced, we signed agreements to process third party gas through our world-class EG infrastructure, positioning our EG assets to deliver strong free cash flow for years to come and to compete as a natural aggregation point for local and regional gas opportunities. Further, we continue to optimize our portfolio, as evidenced by our agreement to divest our U.K. properties, which will remove approximately $950 million of asset retirement obligations upon close, further enabling the focused allocation of our capital to our highest return assets. ","As I\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a mystery as to what investors are looking for, whether generalist or energy focused. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. All investors are looking for companies that have the right portfolio of assets; that have the right strategy putting returns first, generating sustainable free cash flow at conservative oil prices, and sharing that cash flow with investors; that have a strong balance sheet to weather potential volatility; and that have the capability to execute on their commitments consistently. We believe we screen well on these criteria and our performance in 2018 and now first quarter 2019 stand as our proof points. We have a uniquely resilient cash generative portfolio that is already delivering compelling free cash flow yield relative to both other E&Ps and the broader market, with high value oil growth and outcome and all at an organic breakeven of $45 WTI. ","From a sustainability perspective, we have shared a two-year outlook that provides visibility on the metrics that matter most. It is an outlook that prioritizes returns, free cash flow, and return of capital to shareholders. It all starts with continuing to drive our compelling multi-year rate of change improvement in key enterprise performance metrics, specifically our cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share, both of which, as a reminder, are a part of our executive compensation scorecard. We are on track to deliver a 30% CAGR on cash return from 2017 to 2020 at $60 WTI flat, roughly on par with the current forward curve. ","With that returns-first orientation, we deliver sustainable free cash flow generation above $45 WTI with significant organic free cash flow expected through 2020 of $750 million at just $50 WTI flat, and over $2.2 billion or almost double the broader market free cash flow yield at $60 WTI flat. Our positive leverage to higher oil prices coupled with a low enterprise breakeven is a powerful and winning combination in any commodity environment, and though $50 WTI remains our planning basis in a commodity price at which we generate meaningful free cash flow, we believe that continuing to drive our enterprise breakeven point even lower is essential in a commodity business. It was only 2017 when our enterprise breakeven stood at just over $50 WTI. This sustainable free cash flow profile allows us to prioritize return of capital to shareholders and compete for the broadest cross section of investors. We also added a new return of capital metric to our executive compensation scorecard earlier this year to underscore this commitment.","Thank you all for listening, and with that I\u2019ll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We have our first question from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. ","Arun Jayaram","Good morning, Lee. Two questions on EG. One, I was wondering if you could discuss some of the details or cash flow uplift that you anticipate from the tolling and profit-sharing agreement for the Alen volumes with Noble. ","Lee Tillman","Okay, well first of all, we\u2019re very pleased to have the definitive agreements now executed for the Alen unit gas, and maybe just as a reminder for everyone on the call, we are taking advantage of existing capacity at our world-class integrated gas infrastructure at Punta Europa. Really, although I can\u2019t get into specific commercial terms because they\u2019re confidential, the value proposition for Marathon is through a combination of tolling and profit-sharing such that all parties benefit from exposure to global LNG prices.","I would also say that additionally, with only tie-ins and minor modifications required at our facilities with the Alen unit bearing all of the capital costs associated with getting the gas to Punta Europa, capital requirements to Marathon are really minimal. We expect first gas nominally in 2021, so with that we also are going to enjoy the added benefit of extending the Alba tail, our own equity molecules, by delaying any future turn-down of the EG LNG plant. When I think about the value proposition for us, Arun, it\u2019s really building on that base EBITDAX that we\u2019re already achieving through the Alba PSC, and this is layering on top of it through both a tolling arrangement as well as some market exposure through profit-sharing.","Arun Jayaram","Great. My follow-up is the LNG from the facility is sold using a Henry Hub-based index. I believe this runs through 2023 or so. Could you give us some thoughts--you know, obviously the market is well above a Henry Hub linked index, so what kind of cash flow uplift that you could see if we were going to, call it mark to market towards current market prices for LNG?","Lee Tillman","Well certainly you\u2019re absolutely correct, Arun - the agreement that we have in place, the long term agreement we have in place at EG is Henry Hub link, and it does run its course in 2023. Post that time, the Alba volumes will be subject to negotiation into the open market, so there\u2019s absolutely the potential for uplift there. With the Alen volumes, obviously, we will have that exposure to the broader LNG market starting really when we see first gas from that opportunity, and although we really can\u2019t quantify that expertly today, we know that, as you say, given today\u2019s market, we feel that directionally that is simply adding incremental value to what is already a very high value asset for us. ","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot, Lee.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Arun.","Operator","We have our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. ","Neal Dingmann","Morning. My first question, you guys did a magnificent job on the spend for the first quarter, especially versus a lot of your peers out there. I\u2019m just wondering, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of cadence. You talked about your free cash flow plans not only for this year but the longer term plan. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of spend as you see it for the remainder of the year, does it continue to trend just on a more linear basis, or how should we think about that, is my first question.","Lee Tillman","I\u2019ll maybe start, Neal, just by reiterating something from my opening comments, which is our budget is our budget. We have a $2.4 billion development capital budget that compares to a $2.3 billion budget that we delivered against last year. We are a little bit front half of the year loaded in terms of wells to sales, so it was great to come in really with a ratable number in first quarter. You will have noticed that we had a large proportion, though, of wells to sales in first quarter. Many of those, we\u2019ll see the advantage of, obviously, in second quarter and beyond, but everything is going in the right direction for us from a capital efficiency standpoint. The asset teams are doing a tremendous job of continuing to drive completed well costs lower. We certainly saw that as an advantage in first quarter.","As we look throughout the year, we\u2019re very comfortable with delivery against not only our $2.4 billion budget but also our commitments on oil growth for the year. Importantly, that\u2019s going to translate into very strong financial momentum as well, which is first quarter in our plan was always going to be our lightest from a free cash flow standpoint. That momentum is only going to build as we move into second quarter and the rest of the year. ","Neal Dingmann","Okay, great details there, Lee. Just one follow-up on that Slide 10, when I\u2019m looking at the Bakken - again, your wells just continue to be superb there. My question is really on the focus area. You might have already said this, Lee, in other updates, but for the rest of the year, will there be also focus on moving down to Elk Creek or Hector or Ajax, or could you just talk about what the focus is, and if it is moving down there, how do expectations compare versus these stellar results you continue to see recently? ","Mitch Little","Sure Neal, this is Mitch. I\u2019ll address that question. Absolutely as we go throughout the year, you\u2019re going to see additional activity down in Hector area as well as Ajax, as well as continued activity in Myrmidon. It\u2019ll be a bit more diverse program as we go throughout the year, but as you say, really proud of what the team is doing out here, really basin-leading efforts both on well productivity and on well costs. The program that we delivered in Q1, based on available public data for the basin, still looks to be delivering IP30s that are on average about 40% higher than peer average, and when we look at this program in aggregate, we expect the Q1 program to achieve payout in something around six months, so just really impressed with what the team is doing.","You know, we don\u2019t drive our teams to focus on flashy IP24s or even flashy IP30s. The discipline that we\u2019ve instilled is around capital efficiency improvement, looking at hat holistically from both well productivity and the well costs.","Neal Dingmann","Very good, stellar - exactly. Mitch, Lee, thanks so much for the answers.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Neal.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up first on the capex. You talked a little bit about it. Can you talk about the primary drivers of lower budget in the first quarter? Is it primarily lower well costs, and can you talk about whether you see those as sustainable, particularly whether you see any upward pressure on well cost or inflation, and whether it\u2019s--I know it\u2019s early, but if you can hold this type of efficient operations, whether there could be potential downward risk to the full-year capital budget.","Lee Tillman","I\u2019ll maybe offer a few comments and then clearly Mitch can chime in as well, if he wants. When we look at completed well costs, I think of several buckets that are really contributing to our ability to drive those costs lower. First and foremost, it\u2019s really working the supply chain. Our ability to integrate into the supply chain, do a lot of self sourcing has really been a key enabler across all of our basins. Our supply chain team has really stepped up and has just done an outstanding job in how they are assisting the asset teams and driving our costs down from a supply chain perspective. With some of that self sourcing, it\u2019s opened up some interesting commercial opportunities for us as well, particularly with our pumping providers. I think those commercial terms that we\u2019ve been able to put in place that really do reward strong performance and efficiency, so it\u2019s a win-win for both the provider and the operator, have also been a key element of that cost direction.","Then finally, it\u2019s just down to the sheer efficiency that we\u2019re observing. We continue to see, whether it\u2019s our rate of penetration on our drilling rigs and our time to drill coming down, or it\u2019s simply the number of stages that we\u2019re able to put away per day even though some of the stage, maybe, are more complex and more intense than they ever have been, we continue to see gains in those areas. So when you put all that together, that is really what is helping drive our completed well costs lower.","I think if we look out throughout the year, assuming that I think the mandate around capital discipline across the segment continues to hold true and thus supply and demand stays relatively stable in the service sector, we simply don\u2019t see a lot of pressure from an inflationary standpoint that we would need to be concerned with as we move throughout the year. But that\u2019s obviously going to be very dependent upon the activity levels and the response from other folks in our segment.","Ryan Todd","Thanks Lee. Maybe one more on--I appreciate the comments you made, how you\u2019re not interested in any sort of large scale M&A, but you had a nice targeted pick-up of some additional inventory in the Bakken. Can you talk about how you view the environment, whether it\u2019s in the Bakken or the Permian or other basins, in terms of whether there are additional opportunities for smaller bolt-on transactions like that, and what the overall environment feels like for those type of deals? ","Lee Tillman","I think maybe first just stepping back a little bit, Ryan, and talking about our approach to enhancing and expanding our inventory and our resource base, it really is threefold. It starts with the organic enhancement work that\u2019s been going on within our asset teams and within our basins. We saw obviously the results of that in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken as we continue to extend the core area in places like Atascosa County, obviously Hector, and Ajax. So that remains a key element, and we have dedicated development capital that is continuing to chase further organic enhancement this year.","The second element really is the one that you referenced, which is around small, bolt-on, incremental leasing that really fits hand-in-glove with our existing position in basins, so these are very surgical, very selective. We\u2019re really looking at opportunities that are synergistic to the positions that we\u2019ve already created. The 50-plus gross company operated wells that we talked about for the Bakken that came by way of a bolt-on and some leasing, that fits that description perfectly. We also continue to have ongoing opportunities for trade, etc. in places like the Permian, so that is a very important element and really complements the organic enhancement work that we\u2019re doing in basin.","Then when you step a little further afield, we of course have the REX program, which is our resource play exploration program, that is really chasing those greenfield leasing positions that can offer the potential for outsized full cycle returns, so low entry costs, material positions near basins or even new basins, so when I look at all three of those things in concert, and then to me the final complementary effort to that is the work that we continue to do on enhanced oil recovery as well, and we\u2019re on Phase 2 on EOR in the Eagle Ford. So when I look at that framework, we feel very good about our ability to continue to move the needle on both the quality and scale of our resource base going forward.","Ryan Todd","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. ","Doug Leggate","Thanks, good morning Lee, good morning everybody. Lee, I wonder if I could hark you back to the LNG question. It\u2019s kind of aging us a bit, because I seem to remember writing about this in detail in 2005, so we\u2019re all getting a bit older, I guess. But my question specifically is the license expiry in 2023, as I recall, there was a floor in the Henry Hub price somewhere in the 350 range, so I\u2019m trying to understand when you--first of all, what is the prospect for you guys extending that license, and secondly, do you regain any destination rights that were given up to, at that time, BG and I guess now Shell?","Lee Tillman","Yes, first of all, for absolute clarity, I would not refer to them as licensing rights. It was simply commercial agreement for LNG sales off the back of the LNG, so I don\u2019t want people to confuse that, for instance, with the PSC or anything. ","Doug Leggate","Yes, I\u2019m thinking more about the upstream side of it, sorry, in terms of the production. Sorry, I should have been clear on that.","Lee Tillman","Yes. Certainly the commercial terms that you described - again, we can\u2019t get into details on our commercial terms. We\u2019ve already talked about that that Shell\/BG legacy contract runs its course in 2023, and at that point the Alba molecules are available for negotiation into the open market, so we are essentially released from the obligations of that contract. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t renegotiate some type of deal with the existing partners with Shell, but we\u2019re not limited to simply negotiating with them.","As I mentioned, one of the advantages of continuing to bring in additional third party gas opportunities is that we--it allows us to avoid taking the LNG plant into turndown mode, which allows us to extend the Alba tail which gives us more of our own equity gas molecules to get into the market, once that 2023 arrangement runs its course. ","Doug Leggate","Okay, so to be clear, when does the PSC expire and what are [indiscernible] potential for you retaining--","Lee Tillman","The PSC doesn\u2019t expire until--I think it\u2019s post 2030, 2040, in that time period. PSC expiry is not an issue for us, and I would also add that in most cases, when we face extensions on PSCs particularly for a footprint like we have in EG, I think there would be an open door there to negotiate that to the satisfaction of not only us as the operator but also the government.","Doug Leggate","Okay, I appreciate that. My follow-up is--and I\u2019m going to apologize in advance for this one, it\u2019s an M&A question. Look - you\u2019ve done a phenomenal job since you joined Marathon several years ago, and the free cash flow speaks for itself. I like to characterize it as putting good assets in the hands of great management. The downside of everything you\u2019ve done, however, is that your share price has not really been differentiated relative to your peer group, despite everything that you\u2019ve done, so I\u2019m just curious what do you think Marathon has to do to see a step change in market recognition of what you\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m wondering if you see any appetite to take good assets into your management and eliminate what, in some cases, are excess overheads in what is clearly a portfolio that could fit very nicely with some other companies.","Lee Tillman","I think first of all for us--first of all, thank you for the kind words, and it\u2019s been a complete and total team effort to get to where we are today in our transformation journey, so the recognition is really a team recognition here at Marathon. But on share price performance, we try to focus internally on the things that we can control, and ultimately we believe our model, our execution, our portfolio will ultimately win the day, and as investors, whether they be generalists or energy focused, begin to turn their attention back to the sector, we believe that we\u2019re going to offer a very strong investment profile for them to take advantage of. We believe that we can compete with not only our own space but with the broader S&P 500.","Just on the M&A point, and again I\u2019m not going to comment on current deals or anything in the market, but what I would say is when you look at the activity and recent announcements, and even some of the investment plans that we have seen from some of the majors, in my way of thinking, it only really serves to highlight the attractive characteristics of the U.S. short cycle unconventional assets, and the fact that on a risk-adjusted return basis the U.S. unconventionals compete at a global level. So we\u2019re very committed to our multi-basin strategy, we believe that\u2019s the right way to proceed. We think it delivers the right kind of shareholder outcomes, and we\u2019re going to continue to execute against that model. We think with that consistency of execution, the recognition from the market and from investors will come. ","Doug Leggate","So no desire to do anything corporate-wise? ","Lee Tillman","No. ","Doug Leggate","Thanks Lee, I appreciate you answering a tough question. Appreciate it.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold","Thanks, good morning. Lee, you had mentioned a little bit earlier that obviously you\u2019re not going to try to get ahead of some of the free cash flow generation with the stock buyback. Can you generally speak to how you expect to progress at that end? With respect to the U.K. asset sale, just to be clear, and I think you\u2019re getting, what - about 140, 150 from that, that will not be part of, I guess, the buyback conversation? Is that targeted just for more REX spending, or how should we look at that?","Lee Tillman","Yes, first of all, let me take the first part of your question, Scott. It has always been a feature of our business plan this year, regardless of pricing, that our operational momentum and hence our organic free cash flow momentum would be inflecting between first and second quarter and improving as we move throughout the year. Having said that, we\u2019ve also been equally clear that even on our share repurchase program, we\u2019re going to be very disciplined with a governor of how much organic free cash flow are we actually generating. We\u2019re not going to do anything that will damage our balance sheet. We have worked very hard. Our finance team has done a great job of positioning us now to be investment grade across the board with all of the ratings agencies. That\u2019s come from, I think, a pattern of taking very disciplined and thoughtful actions around our balance sheet, and that\u2019s going to continue in the future.","The U.K. transaction is progressing. We\u2019ve kind of said that it would likely close in the second half of the year. When we see that money come into the portfolio, we also have to recognize that there is an offset to that, that is staying back in the corporate structure in the U.K. so net-net, we just have to remember that that by no means is a windfall that we could potentially immediately dedicate into share repurchases.","So we\u2019re going to stay with our formula, which is we\u2019re going to drive our share repurchases through our organic free cash flow. To the extent that we see other proceeds, those will be available for other attractive opportunities - you mentioned REX, we\u2019ve talked about small bolt-ons today, all of that would be in play, and that\u2019s a decision that we\u2019ll take on game day when we see those opportunities arise.","Scott Hanold","Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks, I appreciate that. As my follow-up, you did mention that you picked up a handful of new locations in the Bakken through some organic leasing. Can you give us some color on exactly what part of your acreage did you add there, and is it full operated stuff or is it just bolting on and is it more of a working interest increase? Can you give us a little color on that?","Lee Tillman","First of all, and I\u2019ll mention a few things and then see if Mitch wants to chime in as well, I guess when I think about 50 gross operated wells between the bolt-on and leasing, I don\u2019t think of that as a handful. I mean, that\u2019s pretty meaningful, and that well count, just for clarity, that is gross operated well count. We don\u2019t talk in terms of non-operated or OBO type well count, so I just want to be very, very clear on that.","Because we\u2019re still active from a leasing and even a small bolt-on acquisition standpoint, we don\u2019t necessarily want to get too specific about where we\u2019re chasing opportunities, but I would just say that in general, these are fitting within our footprint in areas where we have developed confidence in our ability to drive more value than likely another operator from those positions.","Scott Hanold","Okay, appreciate the color. I didn\u2019t mean to under-appreciate the size of the adds, because certainly it provides you some pretty good additional runway.","Lee Tillman","I\u2019m sensitive to those kinds of things, Scott! ","Scott Hanold","No worries, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning everyone. My first question is on the corporate objectives. Number three on the list is prioritizing return of capital, which you\u2019ve spoken a lot about. We noticed that you layered in a fair amount of new hedges this quarter, and just wondering if that was opportunistic in wanting to lock in the cash flow now, or is there something that you\u2019re seeing in the operating environment [indiscernible] what we\u2019ve heard, one or two operators talking about cost inflation, or is there something in the A&D market that\u2019s driving your decision on the hedges? I know you mentioned still being active in leasing and small bolt-ons. Just curious, because I thought that the prior commentary on hedges from Marathon was just that you had more flexibility heading into \u201919 given the balance sheet and the free cash flow potential, so just wanted to check in on where you\u2019re at on this.","Lee Tillman","Yes, let me talk broadly about commodity risk management and then I\u2019ll let Dane address the hedge book directly. When we think about commodity risk management, we think about it really in three areas. One you mentioned, Jeanine, which is the strength of our balance sheet, that is part of our commodity risk management strategy. Number two, and also equally as important, is our very low enterprise breakeven point that we\u2019ve established, so that provides us that latitude in a very broad range of pricing environments. Then the third element is in fact our formal hedge book and how we look at hedging, particularly in a portfolio that, for instance this quarter, is a 60% oil weighted portfolio.","With that, maybe I\u2019ll just let Dane talk a little bit about the hedge book and our strategy that we\u2019ve tried to put in play there","Dane Whitehead","Yes, hi Jeanine. Following up on prior meetings with you, or maybe prior calls, commentary on the hedge objectives, in previous years we had a very strong, get 50%--floors in on 50% of our next year production, sort of objective, but as our financial position has improved and our financial flexibility has improved, we have felt like we\u2019ve had the flexibility to be a lot more opportunistic along our way toward that goal. So we saw in this last price run-up the opportunity to put on some really attractive three-ways - 48 by 55 by 74, and so we took advantage of that market rally to put those on.","You know, we stay on top of this on a regular basis and when we see good value there, we put them in. It\u2019s definitely there\u2019s no linkage to transaction or any other things happening in our day-to-day business, it\u2019s really just all about overall price risk management. ","Jeanine Wai","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, thanks. My second question is on well results. We noticed that well productivity as measured by the IP30s declined quarter over quarter, and the biggest declines were in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, which were double digits. I know you indicated in your prepared remarks or in the commentary that you don\u2019t chase flashy early production rates, but can you talk about what\u2019s driving this rate of change, and does the oil productivity track a similar trend to the reported Boe results? ","Mitch Little","Sure Jeanine, this is Mitch again. Maybe I\u2019ll reiterate a couple of the comments I made earlier on Bakken, and then I\u2019ll jump to Eagle Ford and address that as well. I think it starts with taking a look back a little bit, and as I said, I\u2019m extremely proud of the efforts our teams have done to uplift the quality of our inventory across our position in both Bakken and Eagle Ford. Our internal dialog and the discipline and the mindset that we\u2019re establishing is one of capital efficiency and improving corporate returns, so we look at his holistically and over the long run, both from a well productivity and a capex perspective, in the Bakken as best we can tell from public data, our Q1 results are about 40% better than the next closest peer on IP30s, and payout for both our Eagle Ford and our Bakken Q1 programs is on the order of six months. That\u2019s an investment that\u2019s going to compete at the top of our portfolio and really anybody\u2019s portfolio, day in and day out. I\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019re delivering.","All that being said, there will be some variability across all these plays, and that\u2019s nothing unique. We publish our results every quarter down the pad level in Bakken and Eagle Ford, so you can see those trends over time. There\u2019s no doubt that the very best ROC in each of those basins is going to deliver the very best results, so we\u2019ve got results we\u2019re proud of, really impressive earns If you take a look at the Eagle Ford specifically, those are the lowest well costs of any of our four basins. We\u2019ve got access to MEH pricing, an extremely efficient operation in the Eagle Ford, and as I mentioned earlier, the returns from these programs are phenomenal. ","I\u2019ll leave it there.","Lee Tillman","If I could just maybe add in, Jeanine, that this all links back, though, to that first objective we talked about in our framework for success, which is enterprise level returns. Whether you look at Eagle Ford or the Bakken, both of those programs are driving our enterprise level returns directionally more positive, and so we can spend a lot of time talking about IP30s and they\u2019re an indicative piece of information, but you also have to look at [indiscernible] production, well costs, all of those things, cycle times all factor into the economics of these wells, and the reality is our toughest comparison point is ourselves right now, particularly in the Bakken. ","When you look at things from a relative standpoint, yes, there was some change in the mix, and we don\u2019t get too wrapped around the quarter to quarter variations when we see that it\u2019s being driven by geology and other fundamentals. We\u2019re going to remain resolutely focused on returns and making sure that those well level returns translate into corporate level returns at the end of the day. ","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning. A couple follow-ups on some prior questions. First, do the changes that you\u2019re seeing in well costs and productivity vary the relative ranking and capital allocation between basins, and then are the efficiencies that you highlighted earlier on and your expectation for a lack of service inflation going forward already baked into your capex guidance for the year? ","Lee Tillman","Yes, first of all on relative capital allocation, the results that we have been referring to today were really fully cooked into our original multi-basin optimization, so it in no way impacts the relative capital allocation. Recall Brian that we\u2019re kind of on a 60% Bakken-Eagle Ford to 40% Oklahoma and Permian, and even within those splits, we are staying pretty true to that initial relative capital allocation that we talked about back in February. From that standpoint, this is not really impacting, I think, anything from a capital allocation standpoint. ","Brian Singer","Got it, and that applies too on an overall budget perspective when you think about the service inflation and the efficiencies? Is that all baked in, or--?","Lee Tillman","Absolutely, yes. We built in obviously assumptions around both efficiency and inflation into our forward plan. We\u2019re tracking very well to both of those, so again we don\u2019t see that as being in any way a factor in our go-forward capital program.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. Then as you return cash to shareholders above and beyond the dividend, you mentioned that the timing is going to be a function of when you see the free cash coming in on a quarterly basis, if I had to paraphrase what you said earlier. Is that the sole constraint, or are there any broader market factors or share price markers that would determine how aggressive you would want to buy back stock, assuming you\u2019ve got the free cash coming in to do it?","Lee Tillman","Yes, it is a bit of a--I\u2019ll call it a bit of a dual matrix in that sense, Brian. We look, one, at our current and forward free cash flow generation from a sustainability standpoint, so that\u2019s generally linked to our operational performance coupled with where the forward curve is sitting, but we also look at our own internal relative NAV valuations relative to what we\u2019re seeing on our shares in the market, and today we would say that our shares still offer a very good value. Again, going back to that returns first orientation, we believe that that is still the preferred mechanism today for getting money back to our shareholders. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t look at the dividend and assess that each and every quarter, but today I think with the volatility, I think with the ability to scale to free cash flow and the returns that it offers, we feel very strongly that the share repurchase program that we\u2019re on today is the right answer. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate that as we see the market respond. ","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy.","David Heikkinen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. This is a nuance on your activity level and capital. It looks like your working interests are trending a little bit down the last couple quarters versus \u201918. The trend for the last couple quarters, should that continue in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Delaware?","Lee Tillman","Great observation, David, and that\u2019s one that we obviously track and look at as part of our plan as well. We do have a little bit of a localized dip in working interest in the first quarter for both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but that\u2019s going to recover in forward quarters to probably look a little bit more familiar to where we were, say in the first part of even 2018. ","David Heikkinen","That\u2019s helpful. I know you don\u2019t budget and talk about OBO capital and production. What is your perspective, though, for OBO by region given your diverse asset base? I\u2019m just curious, is Delaware coming in higher? Is there any other indications that you can see in Oklahoma, Eagle Ford or Bakken? ","Lee Tillman","The areas, I guess, probably where we feel the non-operated the most are probably Oklahoma and northern Delaware. Not to say that we don\u2019t have a little bit in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, but the areas where we see probably the largest exposure are really in those two basins. I would say thus far, it\u2019s probably still a little too early in the year to fully assess the trends, but we certainly would say that activity today is probably at or a little bit below our assumptions. Whether that trend continues or we see some of that pressure later in the year, that\u2019s something we\u2019re just going to have to watch.","David Heikkinen","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffery Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning, and congratulations on another solid quarter. I wanted to discuss the spacing variances that you mentioned in the press release in Oklahoma. First, are these primary variances within one particular zone, or are they variances between different zones? Also, does this encompass vertical as well as horizontal spacing within a zone or zones? ","Mitch Little","Sure Jeff, this is Mitch again. We\u2019ve been talking for a little while, several quarters at least, on the integrated workflows and state of the art tools that we use, including 3D fracture modeling and seismic inversion processing in Oklahoma on particular to design our development approach in the stack and across the basin, down to a sub-region level. You\u2019re aware that the characteristics change across the play, and so we\u2019ve utilized that integrated workflow to optimize not only well density but also landing zone, so it\u2019s going to vary across each of those. For example, the lower well density was across the single landing horizon where the other two pads would have been across multiple landing horizons, but all in the Meramec section. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, good. That\u2019s helpful, I appreciate that. The other thing I wanted to mention was just the northern Delaware Malaga wells were pretty impressive. I was just wondering are you starting to get some kind of an eye for what the activity level in northern Delaware, maybe in that area, might look like over the next year or so?","Lee Tillman","Yes, first of all, that team has advanced more quickly to multi-well pad drilling than really any other asset that we\u2019ve been involved with, so they are moving at a very rapid pace but they\u2019re still learning. There\u2019s still a lot of delineation left to do there, it\u2019s a big footprint. There\u2019s also some leasehold work that we still have to do in northern Delaware. You couple that with some continued restrictions, I\u2019ll just say globally for the industry around takeaway, etc., I think we\u2019re on a very good pace there. I mean, we\u2019re growing and we\u2019re growing on a relatively small volume, but while we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re learning and we\u2019re also producing these kinds of well productivity very early in the life of the asset, so all of that to me is very encouraging. ","","We view northern Delaware as one of the growth engines for the future, but we\u2019re going to make sure that we pace that, one, in the context of how quickly we can learn and make smart economic decisions, but also in the context of optimizing that in our broader multi-basin portfolio. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thanks Lee. I appreciate the answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Aschenbeck with Seaport Global.","John Aschenbeck","Good morning everyone, and thank you for fitting me in. Just had one question, really on the Eagle Ford. A lot of the focus over the past couple years has really highlighted core extension efforts in Atascosa County, which have been strong; but I also noticed in your slide deck that you still have what appears to be a very sizeable position in Gonzales and DeWitt Counties, where some other operators have been putting up some pretty interesting results. I was just curious how much activity do you have planned in that area in the near term, and when do you think you\u2019ll have some type of, call it core extension test results to share with us? Thanks. ","Mitch Little","Sure John, this is Mitch again. I think we disclosed this as well in our initial capital release, but high 80s to around 90% of our activity is going to be in the Carnes and Atascosa County areas, which leaves the remainder to address things like you\u2019re mentioned here on the call. We have pivoted to not only focus and continue to work on enhancing the quality of the inventory across that expanded core, but also looking at opportunities that have the potential to add hundreds of additional sticks across our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Those activities are being funded as well, and there\u2019s many of them in progress. It\u2019ll likely be late \u201919, maybe early \u201920 before we\u2019re in a position to talk in more detail about those, but this effort and this advantaged quality that we\u2019ve driven across our core basin for the last couple years is now being--continuing to focus on that, but also being expanded to look at opportunities that also increase the depth of inventory in both of those basins. ","The short answer was yes, we do plan activity outside of Carnes and Atascosa this year, but the more holistic answer there is there\u2019s a lot of good things going on in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and our other two basins, for that matter, across the entire space of both, upgrading the quality and the quantity.","John Aschenbeck","Okay, great. Thanks Mitch, that\u2019s all for me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. Can I go back to the dividend, please? You\u2019ve said that given where the stock is right now, a buyback is a better option in your mind. I know that what some of your peers have been doing is raising the dividend as a way of instilling, perhaps, a greater expectation of capital discipline in the sense that when you have a fixed payout amount, it tends to force the organization to work towards that. Do you see a logic in sending that same message, or not really? ","Lee Tillman","I\u2019ll maybe offer a few comments and then ask Dane maybe to jump in as well. First of all, I would say a lot of the sector activity has been raising dividend on what was already a low or nonexistent base, so where we sit today even with all those raises, we are still sitting right around the average from a yield standpoint. We think it does introduce some constructive tension around capital discipline and capital allocation which we think is valuable today in the current environment. Our preferred mechanism is share repurchase, but we continue to assess dividend and dividend yield and payout as a matter of course with our board each and every quarter, and to the extent that we see that that is a preferred mechanism, we\u2019ll address that at that point in time. ","That\u2019s just where we are today. It doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be a year from now.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, that certainly makes sense. One about EG - you guys had about $60 million of free cash flow in the quarter despite, obviously, a low oil price to start the year. Is it fair to say that free cash flow would actually be negative had it not been for the EG operations?","Lee Tillman","No, absolutely not. We have multiple assets that are throwing off free cash flow today, and even with--the big impact in the first quarter in EG was of course the triennial turndown, which took us down basically to zero rate for a period of time, so that\u2019s--so that EBITDAX number is not a ratable number to use for the remainder of the year.","But even with that impact in the first quarter from EG, we still had strongly flowing free cash from places like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford that more than took up the slack, hence the reason we were able to generate $80 million of organic free cash flow in the quarter.","Dane Whitehead","Yes, I\u2019d just add that the $80 million free cash flow number is not directly comparable to an EBITDA, a $65 million EBITDA number. There is in-country tax on this.","Lee Tillman","Yes - 25% tax rate.","Dane Whitehead","[Indiscernible], so keep that in mind as well.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, good point. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee Tillman","We recognize that investors have choices, and we appreciate your interest in Marathon Oil. Execution excellence leads the way in our company, and I\u2019d be remiss without thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who deliver on that mandate 24\/7, quarter in and quarter out.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Guy Baber, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Guy Allen Baber - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Christine, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release, slide presentation, and investor packet that address our third quarter results. These documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our President and CEO, Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO, Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations, and Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy.","As always, today's call will contain forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials, as well to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who'll provide his opening remarks. We will then open the call to Q&A","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio, underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities, compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement, and additional return of capital to shareholders.","Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and boe production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter. We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through superior execution and capital efficiency, we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019, and in the future.","Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This coupled with our peer leading balance sheet further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all of the above strategy that balances enhanced return of cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.","All of uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.","Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation.","We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through three complimentary efforts, organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale, and our resource play exploration program. We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large scale M&A.","Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the four best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution at scale. Large scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success.","So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard, where our capital efficient execution and advantage pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry.","Our third quarter production in the Eagle Ford was up 8% sequentially. Although our objective entering the year was to hold our Eagle Ford production relatively flat, on a year-to-date basis, oil production is up 10% from the prior year on 10% fewer wells to sales. Capital efficiency has been impressive as we are effectively doing more with less. A significant driver of our outperformance has been the impressive results we are achieving outside of Cairns County in the extended Atascosa County core.","In the Bakken, we continue to deliver industry-leading results while simultaneously extending the core of our acreage position. During the third quarter, a 6-well pad in West Myrmidon achieved an average 30-day IP of over 4,700 oil equivalent barrels per day at 73% oil cut. This pad included three new industry record Three Forks wells highlighted by the Jerome well, which establish a new Williston Basin IP 30 record of around 4,800 barrels of oil per day, one of the best oil wells ever completed in the North American resource plays.","Importantly, we are delivering these results alongside an intense focus on capital efficiency as evidenced by our average third quarter completed well cost per lateral foot falling 20% below the trailing 12 month average; truly remarkable execution from our teams and an example of working both the numerator and denominator of capital efficiency.","We also took another important step forward in our core extension efforts to dramatically uplift the quality of our Bakken inventory delivering a strong two-well pad with our first enhanced completion test in the southern part of our Hector acreage. This success follows the consistently strong results we have realized across the northern part of Hector in addition to our successful second quarter test at Elk Creek. Our core extension efforts will continue as we plan to test enhanced completions further southwest in our Ajax area before the end of the year.","It is difficult to have a conversation about the Bakken without addressing recent pricing volatility at Clearbrook. So, let me make a few comments. While we expect differentials to improve with the return of Midwest refiners from heavy maintenance and as incremental barrels begin to move on rail, it is important to understand that we have broad diversity of offtake out of the Bakken to several end markets, and we purposefully maintain flexibility to respond to market conditions. We believe basin pricing will improve near term and over time stabilize to the marginal cost of transport to coastal markets, similar to pricing seen throughout most of 2018.","Further at a company level, a key competitive advantage of our multi-basin model is our exposure to varied end markets for our product, with approximately 50% of our production linked to premium LLS and Brent pricing.","In Oklahoma, third quarter marked the successful transition to multi-well infill pad development. In the overpressured STACK, we are optimizing our development approach at the DSU level to deliver more predictable, more efficient, and highly economic results at various spacing solutions. Both the Irven John infill at four wells per section spacing and the HR Potter infill at seven wells per section spacing are exhibiting very strong early performance, and were delivered at an average well cost 15% to 20% below the parent wells.","Amplifying this quarter's performance, longer term production from our 4Q 2017 Tan overpressured STACK pad at nine wells per section spacing is 40% above type curve at 270 days. In the SCOOP, we delivered two more highly economic Woodford wells following the success of our 2Q 2018 Leitner infill at eight wells per section spacing, which is now trending 70% above type curve at 120 days.","Turning to the Northern Delaware. We are strategically advancing our position and preparing for future development as we further core up our footprint, HBP and delineator acreage, capture efficiencies, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We are making tremendous progress on multiple fronts highlighted by a 50% increase in completion stages per day versus the trailing 12 month average, and a 20% increase to our gross company-operated well locations through bolt-ons and trades since entering the play in 2017.","We are also realizing very encouraging early development drilling results, including a recent three-well upper Wolfcamp pad in Malaga that achieved a 30-day IP rate of about 540 boe per 1,000 foot of lateral at over 60% oil cut. Outside of our four resource plays, we continue to deliver tremendous value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG, which contributed around $190 million of EBITDAX during the quarter.","In summary, third quarter results have again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven, multi-basin model. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics highlighted by an 85% annual improvement in cash return on invested capital at $65 WTI, while also delivering meaningful free cash flow and enhanced return of capital to our shareholders.","As we look ahead to 2019, rest assured that our framework for success will not change. We will remain focused on improving our corporate level returns and growing our cash flow per debt adjusted share. We will protect our financial flexibility and our peer-leading balance sheet. We will remain capital disciplined and set our activity levels to generate sustainable free cash flow at a conservative oil price, and we will return additional capital to shareholders while also maintaining our focus on ongoing resource-based enhancement that generates full cycle returns. In our framework, high-value oil growth is simply an outcome.","The proof points of our commitment to the strategy lie in the strength of our year-to-date results and the discipline we've demonstrated and in the free cash flow we've delivered. We believe the successful execution against our framework has already begun to differentiate us from our peers as industry discipline has frayed amidst higher prices. And we fully expect this differentiation to continue with our peer-leading execution amplified by our advantaged multi-basin model. Thank you.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International, Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Maybe if, just to start out, as we're looking at 2019. I mean I think you've been pretty consistent on your priorities over the course of 2018 when we think about how you like to manage, to balance organic growth versus free cash flow generation and cash return to shareholders in 2019. Can you give us a little, some rough framework around how to think about organic spend and, or activity levels into 2019.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. So absolutely, Ryan, again as I said in my opening remarks, we're, you should expect no surprises from us in 2019 as we get prepared to release our capital budget in February of next year. Obviously we're still busy integrating all the performance data from this year and our multi-based and optimization but just a few things that you can take away in terms of the framework.","It will be returns first with a commitment to capital discipline, no different than this year. We think that's differentiated us this year and that, that approach we'll continue to do that in 2019. I think this year holding our budget essentially unchanged while still being able to essentially raise our resource play production guidance across three consecutive quarters is notable.","But specifically we're going to look to drive a strong rate of change in our corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share and we're going to look to set our 2019 activity levels to deliver organic free cash flow on a conservative oil price deck.","Our objective is sustainable, organic free cash flow that can support an all of the above strategy and that's going to include incremental return of cash to our shareholders as well as opportunistic resource capture. For us, it's not an either\/or proposition. Production growth, as I already stated in my comments, is going to be an output of our process and we are going to be very much focused on high value oil growth because that's where our margins are being generated","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International, Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray","Thanks, Lee. Maybe a follow-up question on STACK. It's got a lot of attention lately from various peers across the space. I mean, you're showing some strong results from your recent spacing tests across a variety of Williston Basin assumptions. Can you talk a little bit about your latest thoughts on the play, base-case, spacing, and maybe how we should think about activity in 2019 in that play maybe both in terms of amount of activity and whether it will remain concentrated in the overpressured window? Thanks.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Ryan. This is Mitch. And, we've been talking for a couple of quarters now about the transition to development mode in the overpressured STACK and in the SCOOP. We've been integrating data from our own activity and from industry. We're applying some advanced seismic processing techniques to help guide the combination of well spacing, landing zone and completion design. And it's the intersection and the combination of all those factors that we're starting to hone in on. And, evidenced by the last three pads in the overpressured STACK are on different well spacing with some differences in completion design as well, but delivering very consistent results. We're going to continue, as we've kind of highlighted in the Oklahoma slides, continued development in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP. You see a number of upcoming pads there.","So, we would intend to stay with that philosophy to continue to leverage the learnings and the application while we're driving well costs lower. We reported 15% to 20% lower on those two specific pads were actually seen improvements in the last quarter across the entire basin that are even above that. And we continue to drive capital efficiency both from the well performance side and from the well cost side across all of our basins. So you should see continued activity with our focus on development in both the overpressured STACK and SCOOP as the majority of our program going into 2019.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. And maybe just to add there, Ryan, as well, clearly, those two areas are fully in development mode. The team is striving for predictability, consistency, and higher returns. But we're going to continue obviously our delineation and appraisal efforts that go across the entirety of the play as well as we go into 2019.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International, Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray","But what's the average cost of oil there in the play now?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, there's multiple plays there, Ryan. We've got various lateral lengths, we've got various pressure regimes that we're drilling in, so we would have to get down to a very granular level. And, I don't have all of that sitting right in front of me. There's a number of different well types, lateral lengths, and drilling and completion designs. So there's quite a range there.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","But I think what's probably notable is the comment that Mitch made earlier, Ryan, about we have already relative to the parent wells taken a significant step down. Are we fully where we want to be yet? No. We still have, in our view, there's still work to be done there to improve the capital efficiency and we're, as we do more of this, we're going to get better at it, just like we are in Eagle Ford and the Bakken, where we get a lot more at bats.","So I'm very encouraged. I think the combination of productivity and a focus on well cost is going to make the STACK and the SCOOP very competitive in our portfolio.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International, Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Lee, I was wondering if you could give us any high level thoughts on just capital allocation between the different basins in the U.S.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. As I stated, we're a little early in the process to get down to a basin level that's clearly going to be a part of our February capital budget release. And as I stated, we've got an immense amount of very positive data to incorporate in our planning cycle this go around.","What I can tell you is with the results that our asset teams are achieving today, all of the basins are competing well for capital allocation. We're going to remain very focused on corporate returns and we want every dollar of our development capital budget to move that key financial metric in the right direction. At a very high level, you should expect the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to continue to receive the majority of our total resource play capital. That's where we're seeing the best returns and the best capital efficiency. And just for your reference, this year, those two basins were about 60% of our capital allocation in 2018.","But as you can see in the 3Q results, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware are delivering strongly and their going to compete for capital even though they are less mature and much earlier in the development cycle. Strategically it's going to be essential for us to continue to fund those two assets for things like leasehold, delineation, appraisal, and early pad drilling so that we keep them on the correct trajectory going forward.","The one other thing that I'll mention too which kind of fits in the context of just capital allocation and in totality is that directionally, we also view that our REx spend, our resource play exploration spend, will also be trending downward as we look forward into 2019.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, could you give us a little bit more details on, I know it's a scheduled turnaround every three years, but give us some thoughts on the capital for that turnaround and the cash flow impact and production impact.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Let me start, Arun, by talking about the turnaround activities and as part of our normal long-term maintenance program, we have a major turnaround like this every few, every three years or so. And if you look back to Q1 of 2016, you'll see sort of a similar type of event. It involves long-term preventative inspections on our rotating equipment there, requires a full field shut down for a period of time in this case, along with vessel inspections and the typical kind of maintenance work we do to ensure the world class reliability that we deliver from that asset and have delivered over the past decade plus.","In this particular turnaround, we'll also be taking advantage of the shutdown to perform some, pre-install some tie-ins. As we've talked about we're progressing agreements to bring additional backfill gas through the facilities that we have on Punta Europa. We continue to progress those and we're going to take advantage of this turnaround to make those preemptive tie-ins. You shouldn't view the capital or cash expense related to this turnaround as meaningful in the context of the corporation or even our international operations but production-wise we have, I think if you reference back to the 2016 we saw 10% to 15% impact on the quarter and that's probably a good guide as we go into, for this event in 2019.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Good morning, all.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hi, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Lee, hi. The criticism that we hear of Marathon typically, or the worry, is that you're short of inventory. Can you address that for us please and give us what your version of that critique is? Thank you. Your counter, I should say.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","No. No. Absolutely. I think from our perspective when you look at the extensive portfolio transformation work that we've done, the differentiated position that we we've established in for the best U.S. resource plays, we feel very confident that our current resource base is both high return and high quality. And, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, even with that, we are continuing to progress a multi-pronged approach to continue to even enhance that very strong base. And we've talked about a few of those.","It really starts with some of the organic enhancement activities that are already producing fantastic results in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The net effect of that is to extend the life of that inventory. We've talked about small and very selective bolt-ons in places like Northern Delaware. The fact that Northern Delaware, we're up over 20% on gross co-op locations since we did the original acquisitions back in 2017; and that's through trade, some acquisitions, and even the most recent New Mexico BLM lease sale. And then, we have our resource play exploration program, which certainly offers the potential to generate outsized returns based on very low entry costs. It's certainly still exploration and we need to always come back to that. But with all of those efforts ongoing in parallel, we feel very comfortable that we have a comprehensive strategy in place to replenish and improve our resource base, and that does not include large-scale M&A.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","I had a follow-up, but actually, you just answered it right there. So, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","All right. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Lee, I'm not sure if you or Mitch want to take this one, but it's a question back to the spacing in the STACK if I may. Looking at what some of your peers, the difficulties they've had, I'm sure you're familiar with what Devon has been saying about moving back to a sort of four-well per section type of spacing unit. And you guys seem to be knocking it out of the park on nine-well spacing. I'm looking at the Tan infill. Obviously, the, I guess, the HR Potter, however you want to put it, to coin that phrase is pretty consistent again beating the type curve. But, I'm looking at the variability in the geology and I'm just trying to understand what are you guys doing differently? Because it looks like you've kind of cracked the code here as it relates to your performance relative to your peer group. So any color you can offer on how you're managing to meet these wells would be great? Thank you.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Doug. This is Mitch. Again, we talked a few quarters ago, we came back and talked about the tailored approach to development strategy and completion design across the STACK. And, I think we were one of the first to come out and say on the far eastern edges, it would be less than six wells per section. And it would be in the heart of the play where we see the best geology, the thickest section and some pressure we would expect to see instances of greater than six wells per section.","I think our results over that time period would prove that out and it looks like industry is kind of centralizing around a similar view that we've been talking about. I think if you look at how we're approaching that without getting into the specific recipe, I would say a couple of unique advantages that we're applying. The database is basically the same for all players, more or less.","The art comes in how you integrate that data in looking at the interplay between well spacing, well landing zone and completion style. We've got over a decade of experience, well over 2,000 horizontal, unconventional completions. We've got a centralized model that allows us to quickly transfer those learnings from one basin to another. And we've got an attitude within our teams that is to never be satisfied with what we did yesterday. So an attitude that's focused on making sure we capture all the learnings not only from our own work but from outside activity.","I mentioned earlier we are doing some advanced seismic processing. We're using that work to target specific zones within the Meramec, across the pressure windows and across the geology, which helps us target the wells in the right interval, and we think is helping guide us to the right spacing specifically tailored to the sub-region and in many cases down to the DSU.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. And I think, Doug, just from my perspective, we have, as Mitch stated, we've been a proponent of, it's not going to be one size fits all across this play. We have really focused our attention on areas that we feel that we have the predictability and the consistency, these higher competence development areas like the overpressured STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That's not to say that there still aren't areas within Oklahoma and even secondary zones that we still don't need to understand and bring that same level of competence to.","And so, I think what you'll see in 2019 is a mix of both of those, both the development pads that we've really started talking about this quarter but also continuing to progress our knowledge base in other zones and other areas of the play that we hope to move to field development in the future.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, I appreciate the answer. If I may try and characterize it as a kind of quick follow up here. So are you at the point now, if each development area is a kind of bespoke well-design, how much running room do you have now in terms of line of sight to call this a transition from early development to full field development. Are you ready to move into the full field development mode here yet?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think for the two areas that we just addressed, Doug, which are the overpressured STACK, specifically the Meramec and the SCOOP at Woodford, that is where we are today. We view those as kind of the foundational elements moving into 2019 and we would intend to hang our appraisal and delineation work around those two development areas.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Last one from me. It's the same topic I'm afraid. The type curve, was the type curve a parent curve or a fully developed average curve for your parent\/child assumptions going forward? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm looking at the 1575 MBOE, is what I'm looking at. 1525 MBOE, sorry.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. 1525 MBOE, I think, yeah. We've had that type curve out for quite a while as you know and we have tried to put type curves out there that are a blend of parent and infill wells in forming that type curve and to describe what we would view as our mean or average expectation across that particular type curve area. So you can think about it as a blend and as an expectation for what we hope to deliver. But, we're going to continue to provide actual data to inform the construction of your own type curve as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. It looks like this got some upside risks. I appreciate your comments.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Jeanine.","Guy Allen Baber - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","I guess just following up on some of the capital allocation and inventory questions, specifically in the Eagle Ford. Can you talk about how the year-to-date results have changed your view of the asset from a portfolio perspective? I think, specifically, did the delineation and improved well results really support adding a little bit more activity? Or given where you are with the other resource plays, should we think about the results as supporting a stronger case for the more than less approach that you mentioned?","Then, this is just because you made a, clearly, a lot of progress in priming the Delaware and now especially Oklahoma and, but your commentary you also reiterated that the Eagle Ford has some of the highest returns and it also provides pretty valuable cash that supports other parts of the business that don't necessarily generate immediate EBITDA?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think for us, Janine, the Eagle Ford is a very unique asset in the sense that it's relatively mature but we have now uplifted the value of a large portion of the acreage there that probably, not so long ago, we would have deemed as lower tier and likely not competing as strongly for capital allocation.","I think what that does for us is it gives us the flexibility to optimize the Eagle Ford to deliver what it needs to do within our broader portfolio. We can certainly grow the Eagle Ford if that's the role we want it to play or we can use it as you stated as more of a free cash flow, capital efficient engine.","Obviously, when we look at these plays and we look at how they fit into our multi-basin optimization, we're looking at many factors including maximizing the use of existing infrastructure to avoid further capital spend, say, on the facilities side. All of those things go into our calculus in terms of where we want to push capital.","But as you rightly say with the level of returns that we're seeing there, we fully expect Eagle Ford to compete very strongly in 2019 and beyond. Almost under any scenario, we see it generating free cash flow within the portfolio, whether that's on a flat production basis or a slight growth profile. But, the beauty again of the Eagle Ford is very capital efficient. It's a fantastic asset team. They continue to push the envelope on innovation and I think there's still a lot of excitement ahead in the Eagle Ford.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Okay. Thanks. And I guess my second question is on well cost. It sounds like you recently took an opportunity to lower cost by switching out a frac crew. As we look forward, what other opportunities are there for incremental well cost savings, whether that's through further self-sourcing and debundling or locking in maybe opportunistic attractive service contracts, or is it really primarily just on continued efficiency gains?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Jeanine. This is Mitch. The simple answer is all of the above, but I'll try to give you a little bit more context. As you rightly stated, we made an intentional decision in the Eagle Ford, which was completed in third quarter but, to swap out one of our frac crews to a different type of service model that allowed us to vertically integrate more of the commodities and supplies internally and self-source those. We're already seeing meaningful contribution to well costs as a result of that. We continue to press on the commercial relationships and partnerships, the efficiency side where we're seeing continued improvement across the basins in terms of pump time or a number of stages completed per day, drilling efficiencies are coming hand-in-hand with that. And, we continue to pursue opportunities that would expand using things like self-sourcing, also looking at local or more regional sand sources, which have a lower cost of transportation. So, it's really an all-of-the-above strategy, and our teams are intensely focused on the entire capital efficiency equation, both the well performance side and the well cost side. And so efforts across many of those spaces, and we still see opportunities to drive further improvement in our cost structure.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","And I think, Jeanine, just on the commercial side of things, when we look at where we spend our service dollars, are really on the, obviously, on the drilling and the frac side. And, we have never had more diversity in our frac providers than we do today. We're seeing opportunities in the market to term up some element of our fleet to lock in some strong commercial terms. So, all of those things are coming into play to continue to allow us to drive costs down on a completed well cost basis.","The other thing I will just mention since we're talking about a little bit of the, a little bit of moderation in our wells to sales in fourth quarter is that in aggregate, we are still delivering wells to sales above the midpoint of our guidance for full-year, and all basins are also within their guidance. So, these are, some of the things we're talking about here are very normal variations in our cadence quarter-to-quarter. There's not some step change occurring here.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, and congratulations, Lee, on a nice execution this year. Mitch...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","...on, you've covered, certainly. Mitch, you've covered most the questions I had on the STACK, but just one quick question. Are you using choke management on these wells to sort of control when you cross over on bubble point there in the overpressured part of the STACK?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Let me address that from a little bit higher level if I could, Bob, and I'll come back and answer your question specifically. But, the way I would characterize it is, there's some ongoing industry experimentation on choke management strategy, and really looking to understand the trade-offs, if any, between kind of returns based on fast flowback strategy, and ultimate recovery, and how that ultimately impacts overall capital efficiency. We obviously are monitoring that activity. We participate in a lot of that activity.","But generally, I would say we're operating with a moderate to slightly aggressive strategy. And we do that by integrating real-time, bottom-hole pressure data into our choke bumps, and use those in combination to kind of drive how we open up chokes on these wells. It's a bit early to reach the ultimate and final conclusion on this. There's a handful of pads with kind of two years plus history but the evaluation that we've done would not show any noticeable impact to EUR based under the different flowback strategies. So we think we've pretty well landed on how we're going to continue to operate these wells as we keep our focus on returns and don't, at this point, see any noticeable impact on EUR.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then my follow up is, in the Bakken it was encouraging to see the results on the two wells on the Lars pad. Were you surprised there that the Three Forks had a higher flow rate than the Middle Bakken that far south?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","I think we've been surprised to the upside across Hector over the last several quarters and really impressed with the work that the team has done there to extend the core out of Myrmidon into Hector and of course we have the successful Elk Creek pad as well. I think you're fairly characterizing that the surprise in the Three Forks has been even greater than in the middle Bakken. But the overwhelming direction of those extension and activities have been positive and the Lars pad two wells are competing very well with kind of industry activity and peer activity out there. So, very encouraged by Lars. We're going to continue a few more tests down in the southern portions of Hector to confirm the overall extent of that. And of course we're on track to have our first test in several years in the Ajax area during 4Q. So more news to follow on that.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. We look forward to that. Thanks, Mitch. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Lee, you highlighted when you were talking about your decision to ramp up the buyback, that it was in part based on the relative valuation of your stock. And I wondered if you could discuss what essentially your second priority would be, i.e., how the capital would be allocated were the stock not trading at a discount?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think that given our returns-first orientation, Brian, that really is kind of the toggle switch for us to really start considering the share repurchase. And to the extent that we made that test and found that that was not competing adequately for capital, we have multiple other uses for that capital on hand. Clearly, we have many developmental opportunities that we could pursue if that was the right decision. We obviously have our work in resource capture. We talked about kind of this multi-pronged approach, everything from small bolt-ons to the activity in REx. And also bear in mind that REx will ultimately, we hope, have some wells go into predevelopment mode. And so there could be some funding requirements there.","We have already a peer competitive dividend that exists today; $170 billion a year of annual dividend. That's certainly an area that could also be tested to see if there was an action that needed to be taken. It's something that is assessed and evaluated each and every quarter in our discussions with our board, no different than share repurchase. Certainly from a from a debt standpoint, we did a fantastic job in 2017 reducing gross debt. We don't have a maturity until 2020. So really from a debt standpoint and a debt metric standpoint, we don't really see a lot of action required there but I think that's broadly how we would think through it, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. That is helpful. And then, my follow-up is actually a follow-up to Jeanine's question early on in the Eagle Ford. When you think about the opportunities to extend resourcing, you highlighted Atascosa County in one of the slides, how significant is that opportunity set from here? How significant do you see the potential for additional inventory and would those additional locations be consistent with the rate of return of what you're drilling now?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, when we think about it from a risk inventory standpoint, Atascosa County obviously was already contributing risk inventory just at a lower economic value. The effect of the work that the Eagle Ford asset team has been to uplift that area and drive those returns even higher and so, we would expect that this is more centered around value and returns. It would have, obviously the net effect of extending that inventory performance over time at the same kind of run rate. So that's absolutely a positive there. And also, bear in mind, this is on a go-forward basis, our most underdeveloped area in the Eagle Ford.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Brian. This is Mitch. I would just add to that, in the release this quarter in the slide deck, we highlighted 28 wells across Atascosa year-to-date average IP 30 of 1,530. If you go back a little bit further, we have over 60 wells that we've brought online now across Atascosa with new generation completion. And the results across those 65 are pretty consistent with the 28 that we're reporting on here. So, we have firmly established, expanded a core, the expanded core, across Atascosa County at this point in our view.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","What I think would be helpful and I think you guys have heard, a lot of questions asking about the Eagle Ford, and effectively running room I think is the basis of most of those. And, I think it would be helpful for us if you kind of step back and think, when you look at your resource growth over the last couple of years, it's been pretty fantastic and I think there's some questions on how much room does say the Bakken and the Eagle Ford have left. I know you're say, circa 30,000 below the Bakken's all-time Marathon high. I'm sorry, the Eagle Ford, the Bakken's at an all-time Marathon peak. How much more running room opportunity do you see to grow those assets over the next couple of years?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, certainly, as we look at the Bakken today with this core extension that we've enjoyed in Hector as we hopefully push that even further, potentially even into the Ajax area, there's little doubt that from a high value oil growth standpoint, the Bakken is going to have a very material role to play for us going forward.","I think, as I stated earlier on the Eagle Ford, I think there we have the luxury of modulating the performance of the Eagle Ford to really maximize capital efficiency and the infrastructure that we have in the field; that could either show it more in a flat profile like we enjoyed this year, or could see it actually get back into a growth mode depending upon how the multi-basin optimization ultimately drives capital and return. So, a lot of flexibility, but our view is that the combination of enhanced well productivity, with the team's continued ability to drive costs even lower, that's a pretty powerful combination. And under any scenario, the minimum expectation is an uplift in economics and value. And, I think at the end of the day, the net result will be an extension of the inventory and time.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. It sounds like more economic considerations than say, you know, worry about what it's going to grow at.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Correct.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, kind of going back to just some of the budget framework conversations. How do, you talked about being conservative going forward, how do you look at the oil price as you consider the budget from a long-term perspective? I mean I know you guys used $50 this year, but certainly, it feels like depending on whether we were eight weeks ago or today, what you use for oil price can, and what you think is conservative, can change. But how do you think about that going forward as you budget for 2019 and 2020?","And then, also, I don't know if Dane has some comments on how you plan for, to hedge the portfolio with that in mind.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, first of all, you're right. For 2018, we had designed our plan to generate organic free cash flow in a conservative $50 WTI world. However, don't confuse a planning basis with a prediction of where oil pricing is headed. We remain bullish on oil pricing going forward. We think our weighting toward oil is the correct orientation. However, in our budgeting, you should expect a similar conservative basis moving forward into 2019 that will allow us to confidently generate sustainable free cash flow that again it permits us to deliver against this all-of-the-above strategy.","That basis, however, should not be confused with our view necessarily of where forward oil pricing will be. We want to provide plenty of headroom between our planning basis and where actual prices may be trending to ensure that we can confidently deliver our development program across a broad range of actual price outcomes.","Dane, do you want to say a few things maybe about, on the hedging and commodity risk side?","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Scott. As we came into 2018 this year, we set a target of about 50% of our oil production to put a floor under. And as you know, we use three-way hedge structures to do that to preserve some of the upside. As we've gone through 2018 and become a fairly significant free cash flow generator, with $1.5 billion cash on the balance sheet and $5 billion in liquidity, it feels like we've got more flexibility as we head into 2018 to be less hedged, I'm sorry, as we head into 2019. And the hedges we have in place right now for 2019 are about half of the 2018 level. And I think we're going to be very slow to add to that, if at all. We're going to be very cautious. We've been more focused frankly on things like Permian Basis (55:00) (sic) [Basin] (55:00) hedging. So, I think we've done a nice job on. And, we'll focus more on that than probably fixed price hedging as we head into 2019.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Aschenbeck of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","John W. Aschenbeck - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning.","John W. Aschenbeck - Seaport Global Securities LLC","So, there's been a lot of color provided on 2019 so far, which has been helpful, but I was hoping to touch more so on your longer-term benchmarks which you haven't updated since Q4 earnings in February this year. But clearly, your U.S. capital efficiency has improved significantly since that time considering you've had the three consecutive production guidance raises.","So, I was curious, when should we expect an update on those longer-term benchmarks? Would that come with formal 2019 guidance? And then if possible, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify the outperformance you've seen this year in the U.S. and what the implications are to your longer-term benchmarks. I suppose what I'm asking more or less is, if you could rewind to the beginning of the year and know what you know now in the U.S., what would your longer-term benchmarks look like or how much better would they be?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, yeah. Well, first of all, I want to maybe just make sure everyone understands that, that the long-term guidance that I believe you're referring to, John, is the 2017 to 2021 guidance that was really geared toward demonstrating the potential of the portfolio at that point in time on a kind of fixed or flat price assumption. And, it was really, again not a business plan but really just illustrating the potential of the portfolio. We'll continue to look at options to provide transparency on mid- and longer-term plans and that may be something we look at in 2019. But, we really start with the premise of being returns focused first. Again for us, those growth CAGRs that we were showing even as part of that case were an outcome of a process that starts with a corporate returns view as its starting point.","And so for us, again, we're going to be very focused and what you'll see in 2019 is very much a focus on where our high value, high margin oil production is going but that also will be an output of our overall returns-first kind of capital allocation philosophy. In terms of, can I project forward on how performance and capital efficiency this year will impact not only 2019 but even beyond 2019, that's still work that's ongoing today.","As you might imagine, one of the beauties of the resource plays is, we get new data and new performance information each and every day and that is being integrated and built into our modeling, really in real time. The other thing I would point out just on budget in general is that we've moved to a mode where capital allocation is something that is essentially dynamic. It's something that we have flexibility in. We will set a budget plan for 2019 but as we move through the year and see performance, as we see costs, as we see commodity pricing, we have ample flexibility in the multi-basin model to make changes and tweaks to that capital allocation all along the way. So, it's a point in time view. That's the way it will be. We'll always be focused on delivering our commitments. But our path to achieve those commitments is something that can flex a bit during the year.","John W. Aschenbeck - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Appreciate the color there, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks.","John W. Aschenbeck - Seaport Global Securities LLC","So for my follow up, I was hoping to get a little bit, a little more detail around your high level approach to uses of excess cash going forward. Was wondering, is it fair to think that you'll keep proceeds from asset sales on the balance sheet for leasing, small bolt-ons, other small transactions like that and then match up your buybacks with organic free cash flow? And then keeping with buybacks, what's your appetite in regard to expanding that program once you move through the remaining $1 billion authorization? Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think, again, today, our view is that a discipline repurchase of our shares is a good use of capital and it offers very competitive returns given our current market valuation. The pace of that buyback is going to be governed or informed by our sustainable free cash, organic free cash flow generation. It, we do not want that program reliant on disposition proceeds. That is not the intent.","This year, we were able to leverage disposition proceeds to drive a very opportunistic and successful REx program. And in fact, we more than fully funded our resource play exploration activities with the proceeds that we received in second quarter of this year. Those disposition proceeds are still available for us to use as opportunities might present themselves and that would be our view going forward.","But the strength of our balance sheet, the flexibility of it, the ability to act quickly and decisively if the right opportunity, small bolt-on, lease. I mean, lease sale is a great example. We could go into the lease sale, be very selective, but also be very decisive about what we wanted to achieve in that lease sale because of the strength of our balance sheet. And we could do that while still also delivering against our share repurchase program. So, to be able to do both of those simultaneously, again it's not an either\/or proposition, that's the model that we want to continue to progress as we move into 2019.","I would maybe just add one final thing too, John, is that you shouldn't expect an exact match between free cash flow generation and share repurchase. I mean, that's certainly a governor, it's certainly something that's going to inform our decisions around pace, but it will not be a, if you will, dollar-for-dollar match.","John W. Aschenbeck - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Got it. That's it for me. Thank you for the time.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the great quarter. Just a quick follow-up on the Oklahoma discussion. Based on your results today, do you agree with the, broadly with the notion that the Woodford supports tighter spacing than the Meramec?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Jeff, this is Mitch, again. And, I think if you're referring to our activities in the SCOOP, we would generally see tighter well spacing per landing zone there than in the STACK. But as we've talked about on a number of occasions, the design or the development approach in the STACK is going to vary based on variations in geology and reservoir quality and pressure. We see a bit more consistency in those parameters in the SCOOP Woodford. And so, yes, we would agree that average well spacing is likely to be higher in the SCOOP Woodford.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color. And yes, I was thinking about the SCOOP when I asked that question. Following up on this business of organic inventory because I thought something interesting came up in the call. Do you view the effort in the Williston southern extension area similarly to Lee's description of Atascosa, which sounded like previously acknowledged locations that are getting better, or are the evolving results creating, or potentially creating, new organic inventory in the Williston?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think we would characterize it largely similar. The improvement in value, the improvement in capital efficiency has been the primary benefit from that. We generally have carried risk inventory in our long-term plans for those areas but at a significantly different value than what we've been able to achieve. There may be some opportunities as we continue to try these new approaches to revisit that but you can think of them largely the same for now.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And, if I could just follow that up, that being the case, it certainly could be said that these locations are far more likely to attract capital in the current environment than they might have been in the way that they were viewed earlier. Is that fair?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, I think that is fair. And I could bring you back probably to the beginning of 2018 when we revealed our capital allocation for this year. There was some surprise in the market with how much we were dedicating to the Bakken but it was on the backs of the great technical work that our teams had done, the evolution and strong improvement in returns that we had seen from those trials to-date, and the confidence we had in moving those into other areas. So, but accurate statement for sure.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I'd maybe just add to that, Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That's great. Thanks so much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","It's kind of interesting to me as we look at the Bakken today that we've gotten, I feel like we've gotten a little bit spoiled and jaded in the Bakken. We've talked a lot about the Lars pad and I look at this, for instance this Myrmidon pad from the quarter, you look at not only the average across the pad but you look at the Jerome well which did 4,800 barrels of oil per day on an IP 30. And, all of a sudden, that's not even headline grabbing anymore which is shocking to me.","I mean these wells are incredible kind of world-class wells and certainly are some of the best that have ever been completed in the North America unconventional space. And, I just want to really, just compliment that team on what has been one of the most notable turnarounds in our portfolio. From almost zero capital allocation back in 2016 to where we find ourselves today, it is one of the most compelling success stories that I can point to in our portfolio.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I agree with you completely. I've been around long enough to remember when it was 400,000 barrel EURS. And we look at these wells now and they're just unbelievable.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Agree.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Appreciate the comments. And not to pile on here too much, but it's also on the backs of well costs that are 20% lower than the trailing 12 months. And, I think the well cost part of the equation is a little bit underappreciated as we talk about flashy IPs and across all of the basins. But, great work on both sides of the equation there.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate it.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Ok.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, I would just like to wrap up by saying, thank you for your interest in Marathon Oil and thank you to our dedicated employees and contractors that safely deliver execution, excellence 24\/7. We cannot produce these results without them. That concludes our call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Sylvia and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Guy Baber. Mr. Baber, you may begin.","Guy Baber","Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning on the call. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release, slide presentation and an investor packet that address our fourth quarter and full year performance, as well as our 2020 capital budget and associated guidance. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO; Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations; and Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy.","As always, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language in the press release and presentation materials, as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who will provide his opening remarks. We will then open the call up to Q&A.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Guy. And thank you to everyone joining us this morning. I will begin my comments covering our forward two-year outlook. And in doing so, I will also cover our track record of execution against our framework for success.","This track record against a transparent set of priorities, corporate returns, sustainable free cash flow generation, return of capital to shareholders is unique in our peer space, it's comprehensive and it has resulted in bottom line financial and operational outcome that few E&Ps have been able to match.","Most importantly, it has resulted in financial outcomes that also compete on a heads up basis against the broader market. Our challenge is less E&P and more S&P. It is this successful track record of execution that underpins confidence in both our strategy as well as our sustainability to continue delivering, despite an ongoing backdrop of uncertainty and volatility.","Looking to the specifics of our forward two-year plan, as you would expect, our outlook prioritizes the financial metrics that matter most; corporate returns improvement and sustainable free cash flow generation across a wide range of commodity prices. And as you've heard me say, again and again, it all starts with our returns-first orientation.","Corporate returns improvement remains a top capital allocation objective, as such, it should be no surprise that it's also a key element of our executive compensation scorecard and our focus is bearing fruit.","Our underlying price normalized 2019 cash return on invested capital is over 50% higher than in 2017. This robust improvement is the product of success across multiple dimensions, portfolio management, concentrated capital allocation, efficient operation, high-margin oil growth and significant cost reductions.","Looking ahead, we fully expect to continue building on this momentum. Disciplined reinvestment across our high quality multi-basin portfolio will continue to drive our underlying corporate returns higher at a rate that outpaces our production growth.","The second key element of our outlook is sustainable free cash flow generation at a wide range of commodity prices. Our track record of free cash flow delivery is well-established at this point and speaks for itself.","Fourth quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of post dividend organic free cash flow generation, a track record that is largely unmatched by anyone in our peer group. In total, we've generated approximately $1.3 billion of post dividend organic free cash flow since the beginning of 2018 with over $400 million delivered during 2019.","With improving capital efficiency, we expect and even stronger underlying free cash flow profile for 2020 and 2021. At a flat WTI oil price of $50 per barrel, we forecast around $600 million of post dividend organic free cash flow over the next two years.","A few other important takeaways from our two-year free cash flow outlook. Our plan is resilient. Our outlook translates to a post dividend organic free cash flow breakeven oil price of $47 per barrel WTI in 2020, with an even lower breakeven in 2021.","Our low oil breakeven price advantage hedges and conservative balance sheet effectively insulate us from temporary downside price volatility. That said, should commodity prices further deteriorate for an extended period of time, we have ample flexibility built into our plan to respond without negatively impacting our underlying operations or our hard earned capital efficiency.","Let me be clear. outspending cash flow in 2020 is not an option for Marathon oil. And we will adjust our plan as necessary to protect free cash flow. Our underlying capital efficiency and free cash flow momentum improves markedly over the next two years.","In fact on a flat $55 WTI basis, our projected 2020 and 2021 free cash flow is similar to that realized in 2018 and 2019, yet at a WTI oil price that is $6 per barrel lower along with much lower gas and NGL prices.","Our upside leveraged to even modest oil price support is significant. While the forward curve is depress today, commodity prices will undoubtedly remain volatile. And are crude weighting, coupled with a low enterprise breakeven oil price is a powerful combination in any price environment.","At $55 per barrel WTI, we generate $1.3 billion of post dividend organic free cash flow over the next two years, at $60 per barrel WTI this rises to over $2 billion. Our track record of free cash flow generation is differentiated and our disciplined approach to capital budgeting has served us well over the last two years.","And our forward outlook is not only attractive against E&P peers, but delivers organic free cash flow yields competitive against the broader market at moderate commodity prices.","Moving on to the third key element of our framework. Rest assured, we will continue to prioritize the return of capital to our shareholders, through a competitive dividend and through our $1.4 billion of outstanding share repurchase authorization. Notably, return of capital to shareholders remains a component of our executive compensation scorecard.","Since the beginning of 2018, we have returned approximately $1.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, representing around 23% of our cash flow from operations. This has included $1 billion of share repurchases that have reduced our outstanding share count by over 7%, including $350 million of share repurchases executed in 2019.","Importantly, this return of capital has been entirely funded by organic free cash flow, not by asset sales proceeds. Over the last two years, we have successfully distinguish ourselves as one of the only E&P companies that has both generated meaningful free cash flow and returned a significant portion of that free cash flow back to investors.","This leadership position is important to us. And we fully expect to continue building on the success in the years to come. Finally, differentiated execution remains the engine that powers our delivery of financial performance. It is a broad mandate, but really centered on execution excellence and consistent delivery against our external guidance.","Over the last two years we have consistently delivered on our commitments with no increase to our initial development capital budget while exceeding our annual oil production growth guidance. Our capital budget is a commitment not a suggestion.","We have consistently improved our capital efficiency driving a 10% annual reduction in completed well cost per lateral foot and 15% annual reduction in U.S. unit production expense in 2019.","And we realize success across all elements of our resource capture framework cumulatively adding over 1000 locations through a combination of organic enhancement, resource plan exploration, and bolt-on acquisitions and trades.","The addition of these new locations represents approximately three years of inventory, further demonstrating the long-term sustainability of our strategy. It is not just about results, but how we deliver those results. And 2019 was yet again a year that we can be proud of, including our best safety performance on record.","And as we look to 2020 and 2021 differentiated execution will remain a defining characteristic of our company. We will continue delivering on our commitments, $2.2 billion of development capital in 2020, contributing to 6% U.S. oil growth at the midpoint, with comparable capital and growth expected in 2021.","We will maximize our capital efficiency through more efficient operation fully expecting to continue driving our well cost and unit production expense lower. And we will remain as focused as ever on further improving our already high-quality resource base through our sustainable resource capture framework, all with an eye on full cycle returns.","Transitioning to the specifics 2020 program, our disciplined $2.4 billion total capital budget is down 11% from 2019, it is also down from 2018 spending levels. Our budget is comprised of $2.2 billion of development capital and $200 million of resource play exploration capital, successfully balancing corporate returns, free cash flow generation and our strategic objectives.","The outcome of our rigorous capital allocation process is 6% U.S. oil growth in 2020 at the midpoint of our guidance with oil growth outpacing boe growth consistent with our focus on corporate returns.","Again, we expect comparable development capital and comparable oil growth in 2021. Importantly, our forward trajectory is sustainable prioritizing ratability and consistency of operations to maximize capital efficiency over a multiyear period.","The outcome is returns creative oil growth on both an annual and exit-to-exit basis in 2020 and 2021, while prioritizing free cash flow generation. And I want to emphasize again that our plan is both resilient and flexible. We can't predict forward commodity pricing, but we do know that it will remain volatile.","While, our low cash flow breakeven and conservative balance sheet insulate us to downside volatility, should pricing deteriorate to below our breakeven levels for an extended period, we have the flexibility to adapt without compromising our underlying operations or capital efficiency. And for avoidance of doubt, under any reasonable commodity price scenario, we will not outspend our cash flow.","Moving on to the asset specific detail that make up our 2020 program, roughly 70% of our development capital will go to the Eagle Ford and Bakken, up from approximately 60% during each of the last two years.","This shift reflects the relative returns generated in the current commodity price environment that places a premium on oil mix relative to gas and NGL, and further highlights the strength and flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio.","The recent success of organic enhancement in these two basins with over 500 locations added since 2018 and hundreds more upgraded provides the opportunity and confidence to allocate more capital to these high return assets.","The Eagle Ford will continue to deliver strong returns and free cash flow, but will also contribute oil growth even with an expected year-over-year reduction in wells to sell. Coming off the strongest two oil productivity quarters on an IP30 basis and the history of the asset.","We expect continued strong results from our primary development program across Karnes, Atascosa and the Northeast core which was recently expanded with the fourth quarter closed of a bolt-on acquisition that added about 18,000 contiguous and largely develop -- undeveloped net acres.","Additionally, we will continue progressing organic enhancement initiatives, including our redevelopment and enhanced oil recovery programs. Early results from both of these programs have been encouraging with both having the potential to meaningfully add to our total resource base.","In the Bakken, we will continue delivering strong financial return, free cash flow and oil growth. Our 2019 Bakken development program will pay out in 11 months at actual 2019 cost and pricing.","While this accomplishment is impressive, we expect to drive further improvement to these already industry-leading financial returns in 2020. The result of an increase in well productivity and further reductions to our well cost.","Completed well cost already average below $5 million during fourth quarter, down 18% from the 2018 average with a recent pad delivering an average completed well cost of $4.3 million.","In Oklahoma largely in response to the dramatic weakness in gas and NGL pricing relative to oil, we are reducing our investment to a more concentrated two to three rig program focused on oil-prone areas in the SCOOP to protect our returns and prioritize free cash flow generation.","Critically, our Oklahoma asset transition to positive free cash flow generation during the fourth quarter benefiting from the combination of reduced spending, efficient operations and strong productivity, including basin-leading performance from the SCOOP Springer.","Over the next two years we fully expect Oklahoma to maintain its positive free cash flow status even at the current depressed forward curve for natural gas with 2020 oil production comparable to the 2019 average and overall oil mix for the asset rising.","In the Northern Delaware capital efficiency will continue to improve with an expected average lateral length increase of over 35% in 2020, a strong indicator of the progress in our ongoing efforts to core up our position.","We will strategically pace our investment with a focus on full cycle returns while we continue appraising our acreage incorporating learning, enhancing our margin profile and realizing early development success in critical intervals.","On only a modest increase in wells to sales, the asset will again contribute to total company oil growth. After successful divestments in the UK and Kurdistan, we have simplified our international portfolio to our integrated gas business in Equatorial Guinea which had another strong year, delivering just over $400 million in EBITDAX.","While 2020 financial delivery will be off trend from 2019 due to the combination of scheduled maintenance and weaker commodity prices, we expect earnings to recover in 2021 and beyond.","Schedule maintenance during 2020 includes the first quarter turn around already underway at our AMPCO Methanol plant as well as planned E.G. LNG maintenance during the fourth quarter.","Regarding price, aside from the obvious impact on condensate, weak gas prices will affect our legacy Henry Hub length L&G contract and associated E.G. LNG equity income. Global menthol prices have also fallen to cyclical lows.","Looking ahead for E.G. Our 2021 earnings forecast is similar to 2019 price normalized. We began to realize benefits from the Alen backfill agreement in 2021. Our legacy Henry Hub LNG price contract expires in 2023, and there are no significant plant E.G. turnaround until 2024.","Further, we continue to pursue additional backfill gas opportunity to leverage our advantaged infrastructure position. Bottom line, our unique integrated business in Equatorial Guinea will remain a strong contributor to our total company earnings and cash flow stream for years to come.","While that covers our development capital and producing assets, we have also established a $200 million resource play exploration budget for 2020. This budget reflects the transition from primarily acreage capture to exploration and appraisal drilling activity in two oil plays of scale; the Texas Delaware and the Louisiana Austin Chalk. Our overarching objective remains competitive full cycle returns through low entry cost.","In the Texas Delaware, we have established the contiguous 60,000 net acre position perspective for both Woodford and Meramec targets. We now have three Woodford wells online at an average 60% oil cut.","Extended production history from our first two wells continues to demonstrate strong productivity, lower water-oil ratios and shallow declines. Our recent third Woodford well is on flow back with early rate consistent with our expectations. Our initial Meramec exploration well is in progress.","In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, our first modern completion in the overpressure Western Fairway of the play is on flow-back and cleaning up. While it is far too early to draw conclusions, the well is demonstrating strong productivity with recent oil rates of 1200 barrels of oil per day on a restricted choke and had a flowing wellhead pressure above 8000 psi.","Gas oil ratio, API gravity at around 49 degrees and water-oil ratio are all consistent with our pre-drill expectations. Again, some encouraging early performance in contrast to some erroneous conclusions you may have seen drawn from state data featuring test rates in the first 72 hours of cleanup.","With the early results of the first well confirming our expectations on initial productivity, oil quality, as well as reservoir energy, we recently spud our second exploration well in the play and we'll have results to discuss later this year as we continue to integrate longer dated production with 3D seismic.","In summary, we are proud of our results and how we deliver those results; safely responsibly and ethically. And our executive compensation scorecard reflects those core values with safety environmental performance in GHG intensity each represented alongside corporate returns and return of capital.","For two years now, we have delivered financial and operational outcomes that few E&Ps in our peer space have matched. Yet, while we will continue to work hard to retain and build upon our competitive advantage versus direct E&P peers, we are just as focused on effectively competing with the broader market on the financial metrics that matter and doing so in a volatile commodity price environment.","We believe in our strategy and our framework for success, corporate returns first, sustainable free cash flow generation and prioritizing return of capital to shareholders, a framework builds upon our multi-basin portfolio and a balance sheet that is an investment grade at all three primary rating agencies.","Within that context, we will remain focused on what we control, which is our execution and the consistent delivery against our framework, quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. We continue to believe that it is this superior financial performance that will ultimately be rewarded by the market.","Thank you all for listening. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Hanold.","Scott Hanold","Yes. Hi. It's Scott Hanold from RBC.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold","Just to kind of playoff some of that -- the last commentary you made there early in what gets the Marathon rewarded by investors? Certainly, you've been putting up some good free cash flow numbers. The market doesn't seem to be really view that is positively as one would expect. How do you think about this versus option that you have to pivot other things and that may include obviously capture of a bigger resource position?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Thanks Scott and good morning. You know, Scott, we are committed really to allocating capital that balances returns improvement with sustainable free cash flow generation. That's our model. That's our frameworks for success. I think we've now clearly established a track record against that model, that track record I believe speaks for itself. I think we've taken not only a strong shareholder friendly actions, but we've also delivered on our underlying operational commitments. And to us it really comes down to ensuring that model is sustainable, that model is resilient and that we continue to protect the upside through our oil leveraging. But, we believe in our strategy, Scott, and you should really expect no changes for us going forward. Hence, the reason we provided the two-year view of our financial outcomes.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Appreciate that. And then, talking a little bit about the Delaware -- Northern Delaware basin. It looks like capital to that area is obviously down a little I think year-over-year, and with Eagle Ford and getting a little bit more, but can you talk about what you've learned in some of that Red Hills, initial Red Hills well you've drilled. I mean, I would have expected Delaware to be a bigger part of 2020. I guess is my base question. And what have you've found in some of these core areas that you have relative to say the opportunity in the Eagle Ford?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Let me talk a little bit about overall allocation and perhaps I'll flip over to Mitch to provide a little more operational color on Red Hills and the program we just completed there in fourth quarter. First thing, not to state the obvious Scott, but the entire total capital budget is down 11%, development capital is down 9%, and actually from a mix perspective the Northern Delaware is still receiving essentially a very similar mix of that lower capital allocation. Again for us, it comes down to that capital allocation is driven by the confidence in generating those high returns and hence that's why you've seen that slight makeshift from 60% to 70% to Bakken and the Eagle Ford. That in no means is means that we are disappointed in Northern Delaware. It just means we have superior opportunity today and other parts of our portfolio, because of the current commodity price environment. With that, maybe I'll handover to Mitch and let him give a little bit of color on our -- the specifics of our program.","Mitch Little","Yes. Sure, Scott. As you're referencing, we had a fair bit of delineation work in 2019 included in the Red Hills area. What I would say about that is we're encouraged by the early results from the delineation work. We tested a lot of different intervals, as well as some different completion designs, saw some particularly encouraging signs in the Upper Wolfcamp and Bone Spring. Relative to the capital allocation as well, wells to sales this year will be slightly up from 2019 levels. The majority of that activity is going to be focused in those intervals, the -- both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring and it will across Malaga and Red Hills. Little bit less delineation activity this year as we are focused on the corporate returns and free cash flow generation. And that also give us time to integrate some longer-term performance data from the 2019 delineation efforts and feed that into our capital allocation process.","Scott Hanold","Okay. So overall would you say the Northern Delaware, is there anything that limit you from going faster? Is there any infrastructure? It sounds like, wells are performing good. So is there any infrastructure concerns or issues that need to be addressed as well in that area?","Lee Tillman","Now, we're making great progress there, Scott, and by year-end, we had I think about 90% of oil and water on pipe. We've got good midstream infrastructure on the gas side as well. And so, it's really -- the underlying driver there is our capital allocation process and focus on top level corporate returns.","Scott Hanold","Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield.","Derrick Whitfield","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. In regards to your 2020 and 2021 outlook, your broad outline suggests capital efficiency is improving in both 2020 and 2021. Would it be fair to assume the capital efficiency gain in 2021 is largely driven by the moderation of your U.S. base declines suggesting you're not banking lower well costs into 2021 estimates?","Lee Tillman","I think, there's obviously a lot of factors that go in to the efficiency improvements year-over-year. But I would say that a consistent theme in both 2020 and 2021 is still a continued improvement and not just well productivity, but also our ability to drive completed well cost, as well as our own I'd say unit cost at a field level lower. And that theme simply just continues and accelerates a bit into 2021. So, it's a multiple factors, but certainly that trend that we have established now over the last two years of not only driving our capital costs down from a completed well cost standpoint, but also our unit production expense in the U.S., all of that is contributing to that improvement in capital efficiency moving forward.","Derrick Whitfield","That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, shifting over to the Louisiana Austin Chalk, the initial results suggest a highly charged reservoir with strong energy drive mechanism in place. Are you expecting that degree of wellhead pressure across the Western fairway?","Pat Wagner","Hi, Derrick. This is Pat. That's correct. I mean, we have a flowing tubing pressure today of over 8,000 pounds and it's as expected. This is a very highly pressured part of the play with very good deliverability and we do expect that the Western fairway will have this sort of pressure.","Derrick Whitfield","Thanks. It's very helpful guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Good morning, Lee.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Jayaram","Since you created the REx -- good morning. Lees, since you created the REx program, we've seen a pretty sharp retrenchment in dollar per acre valuations, as well as public market valuations for E&P. I was wondering if you could comment how inorganic opportunities are now competing relative to REx in terms of portfolio enhancement. And if you've looked at any deals more recently given this backdrop?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I think what I would do, Arun, I'll take you back to our overall resource capture framework. And it's not an exclusive strategy. If you look at the three elements of that strategy, it starts first and foremost with organic enhancement, which is really working the assets that we already have in the portfolio. And the team has done an incredible job there in not only replacing inventory, but uplifting a good bit of the additional forward inventory.","The other piece of that is an organic growth looking at both small bolt-ons, as well as trades. And in that, the example I would point to is in fact the position that we just established in the Northeast core of the Eagle Ford that closed at the end of the quarter. And here we had the ability to add on to an area that now has created this 70-well development opportunity for us. And so, that part -- that market opportunity we continue to look at those. And then as you mentioned the third element of that is the REx program. We believe that you need to generate success across all three of those dimensions.","It really isn't an all-of-the-above strategy and in some years it may flex more toward one of those three than the others. But that is a strategy. And certainly, Pat and his team look at all those opportunities whether they be REx opportunities or inorganic opportunities that are around our existing footprint.","Arun Jayaram","Got it. And just based on that commentary, there appears to be any focus on call it larger scale M&A?","Lee Tillman","Well, I think, we have worked very hard to develop this comprehensive resource capture framework. We've transformed our base portfolio and created this differentiated position here in the U.S.. And what that means is, that for us, really large scale M&A is not required for our forward success. We're improving our returns. We've generated free cash flow over the last eight consecutive quarters. So our model is delivering the financial outcomes. And so, in that context any opportunity, whether it be large or small scale inorganic is going to be looked at through that lens. How can it be accretive to what we're already achieving. And that's a as you might imagine a very high bar.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And one modeling question regarding E.G., Lee highlighted how that business unit generates a little bit more than $400 million of EBITDAX in 2019. You expect that to recover in 2021. I was wondering if you could give perhaps the impact from the maintenance and downtime and the lower Henry Hub prices in 20 relative to that $408 million you printed last year?","Mitch Little","Yes. Arun, this is Mitch. The maintenance impacts are pretty well laid out in the slide deck. But just to kind of go back through those. We're in the midst of a major turnaround at the AMPCO methanol facility. That's going to have about a $30 million earnings impact on the quarter. And then expect it to be back up and running for the rest of the year at kind of full rates. In Q4, we then have some planned maintenance at the LNG facility, which will impact the gas rates. But we'll continue to process the liquids and so they're not going to be an impact on liquid rates.","Sensitivity to product prices, we can't talk about the specific terms of the E.G. LNG contract for confidentiality reasons. But it is a Henry Hub length contract. We're seeing pretty material degradation in that index relative to 2019. And so that's going to be meaningful. And then, of course, methanol prices are at kind of a cyclical low right now as well. So, I think it's important to look forward. We've got the long-lived Alba field with shallow decline and essentially no reinvestment. That's been on a steady trend and we expect it to continue to do so.","And then looking forward, we've got the Alen volumes that should start up in 2021, early 2021. The Henry Hub index contract expires at the end of 2023. So back on -- in 2021 our normalized prices back to earnings levels similar to 2019 and then additional upside through the things I mentioned, as well as continuing to look to source additional backfill volumes following the Alen agreement that we signed up last year right.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And this is in your free cash flow guide though?","Mitch Little","It's absolutely. All of that's baked into the two year profiles that we've given you.","Arun Jayaram","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai.","Jeanine Wai","Hi. Good morning everyone. My first question is on the two year cumulative free cash flow. For the updated tier, can you walk us through how to reconcile the recalibrated $600 million versus $750 million plus. I know some of this is likely commodity price related and so you just walk through some of the easy stuff. But we're also wondering if you could quantify the capital efficiency improvements, which would be a positive offset to using lower prices?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Hi Jeanine, this is Lee. Just relative to the last disclosure on the two-year view and the delta there. It really is all about pricing. If you go back and you look at the price decks that were used to calibrate the 750. And again, we're not trying to predict pricing. We're simply putting a benchmark case out there for you. Obviously, it had much higher pricing for both gas and NGL. We kind of brought those back to more market based levels to present what we believe is a much more realistic view of the free cash flow generation.","And so, despite the fact that we actually are having an improvement and underlying capital efficiency, obviously, it's very difficult to offset the full impact of a significant downshift in both gas and NGL pricing. But without quantifying what I would tell you is directionally capital efficiency is improving. The bulk of that delta is really associated with the assumptions around gas and NGL pricing.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is related to REx. In terms of again capital efficiency tailwind year-over-year. REx budget for 2020 reflects transition from acreage capture to more exploration or appraisal kind of thing. So how much of the 200 million of REx this year is actual productive CapEx as opposed to spending more money on seismic or additional acreage capture either within known REx areas or otherwise?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Jeanine, again, we don't provide that fine line on it, because obviously we'll be driven by performance throughout the year. But the budget is primarily focused on exploration and appraisal drilling in both Texas Delaware and Austin Chalk. Obviously, there are still some spend in seismic and geoscience work there. But the bulk of it is really oriented toward continuing to explore and appraise with the bit in those two plays.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Jeanine.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate.","Doug Leggate","Well, thanks. Good morning, Lee. I got a couple of interrelated questions and I apologize for getting into this level of detail, but I've got -- my first one is on E.G. and my second one is on the value proposition of Marathon, but also the industry. I just want to get your perspective on that. First on E.G., the free cash flow guidance you've given, clearly is a big chunk of that comes from E.G.. Yesterday, Noble laid out trajectory for how Alba declines over time and it appears the bulk of the backfill as I understand it is going to come from Alen. So I'm just wondering, can you walk us through how you see the free cash flow evolution of E.G. in your trajectory? And then, I'd like to get into the valuation question if I may.","Lee Tillman","Yes. I'll offer my thoughts and if I miss anything I'll ask Mitch to jump in. First of all, what I would say is that we feel very strongly that the E.G. asset is going to be a free cash flow generator for the future for the company. And the Alen backfill we believe is just a first step as we continue to look to leverage what is a truly a world-class piece of infrastructure there. And so, we think that we have -- but I want to emphasize that from a free cash flow generation standpoint essentially we have all of our assets ex-Northern Delaware are generating strong free cash flow going into both 2020 and 2021","And so, I don't want to paint this as an E.G. only story. The thing that differentiates E.G. is the fact that the reinvestment levels are relatively de minimus there. However, from an absolute free cash flow generation standpoint, all three of our U S basins ex-Northern Delaware are contributing strongly to that free cash flow profile going forward in time.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is kind of related to this. And again forgive me for this lead, but we all know how bad the sector has performed and you have been early to committing to free cash flow and you should be commended for that. The issue we're all facing however is that the annual -- the free cash flow you're suggesting in your guidance the $1.3 billion over two [ph] years, let's assume that's annualized. Your enterprise value is $12.4 billion. If you can sustain that and then go to maintenance capital, the metrics required to justify material upside to the share price are pretty challenging even at 1.3 billion cumulative two-year free cash flow.","In other words, if you do a DCF on what your trajectory looks like, we're having a tough time seeing what -- how the industry positions itself as a deep value proposition. So my question is how do you see the free cash flow evolving? And what do you think you're sustaining capital is on a reasonable timeline assuming you've got the inventory to support it. So it's a bit of a detailed question, I understand that. But the issue is, how do we show the value proposition because a $650 million annualized free cash flow number doesn't get your $12.4 billion enterprise value?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, first of all, I mean, obviously we look at multiple financial metrics, Doug, you know, free cash flow is important, but as is corporate returns. And our commitment is that as we allocate incremental capital to the business that it is going to be accretive. Those dollars will be accretive to driving those cash returns on invested capital higher. Hence, when we look at it from 17 to 19 on even a price normalized basis, we've had a 50% improvement and our cash return on invested capital.","I think from a value proposition standpoint when we kind of look at the metrics that matter and we look at pre, post dividend even free cash flow yield for ourselves, we feel that does compare very favorably for similarly sized industrial companies within the S&P 500. So, we believe that the value proposition is one a high rate of change on corporate returns coupled with the ability to generate that free cash flow at relatively moderate oil pricing that essentially delivers the yield that is competitive with the broader S&P space. And we believe that's a recipe for success and competing for forward investment.","And of course, the key thing is being able to do that consistently. Because you really can't talk about returning cash to shareholders until you actually generate the cash. And that's what we've been doing for the last two years. And so, I think we've got the track record. I think from a value standpoint, if you look at returns, if you look at free cash flow yield and our return of cash to shareholders, I think there is a very valid investable thesis there. And now, I'm talking specifically about Marathon, there are some broader issues within the sector that we can probably talk about on another day.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate, you trying to answer the question. Thanks a lot, Lee.","Operator","Our following question comes from Paul Sankey.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, Lee. Thanks. Actually Doug and I are on the same track. But I wondered how you think about the potential for a CapEx cut and levels of sustaining capital as sort of part of that same question effectively. For example, in 2020 what would you say is your growth capital versus your sustaining capital? Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, first of all, given that we have a relatively low enterprise breakeven WTI price well north of -- sorry, well south of $50. We feel that, we have the resilience even with where the current strip looks today to execute our business plans, drive returns and drive free cash flow. So, today even though we have the flexibility to adapt, we don't believe that we're in a price band that would require Marathon to take that kind of move. If we do see sustained pricing that just below that enterprise breakeven, we feel that that is a longer term outcome. Then we have a lot of levers available to us to dial back capital.","And I think you've seen from our past history, we've been very disciplined around our capital. We set our budget. We adhere to that budget and any potential for upside price performance we simply drive that to the bottom line and basically produce more free cash flow. I think from a maintenance capital standpoint, obviously for us when we look at improving capital efficiency over the next couple of years that's a bit of a moving target and it's clearly impacted by the activity in the previous year. But we are well south of $2 billion probably in that kind of $1.8 billion kind of range on maintenance capital going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","That's very helpful. I've got a really quick specific, I apologize specific modeling question then I'll ask -- try for a final question with a very big one. Is there a production impact from REx appraisal drilling incorporated in the 2020 volume guide?","Lee Tillman","Yes, there is. It's obviously highly risked, Paul, because we -- this is still an exploration program and it's relatively de minimis.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And then the big one would be, again a follow-up to the idea of attracting general aspects of sector. Is there potential for you to do a big merger, a big deal something a real big calculus move? Lee, I'd be very interested about your thoughts? Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, I guess right now, we believe that the right catalyst is consistently delivering corporate returns and free cash flow and getting that cash flow back to shareholders that we believe that is the right strategy, the right mechanism to attract that investor back. As I've said, I think in a previous question, the work we've done on our portfolio, the success that we're having with our resource capture framework, that model is designed to ensure that large scale M&A is not required for our forward success.","And obviously, again, as I stated any inorganic opportunity whether it's large or small has to be looked at through a lens of financial accretion, free cash flow accretion, balance sheet accretion, natural synergies from a portfolio standpoint, as well as overcoming potentially social issues. So, there are pretty significant barriers for that. And even just a general sense. But for us specifically we've tried to ensure our model delivers on the investor mandate without a requirement for pursuing that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, Lee, to be very clear here. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, Lee and team, my first question centers on your Bakken play. Just wondering looks like for the quarter for 4Q, your NGL and gas production the plate grew about 30% sequentially, while the production for oil was down a bit. I'm just wondering, was that due largely to the processing capacity coming online? And could maybe in conjunction with that just speak to your expectations for oil cut for that play going forward?","Mitch Little","Hey, Neal, it's Mitch. The way you've characterized it is accurate. As you well know, the renaissance in the Bakken and the increased productivity drove increased activity and it's taken a little while for the midstream infrastructure to catch up. There has been a lot of infrastructure added in the back half of 2019 and that will continue through 2020 and early into 2021. So, you're seeing the benefits of that relative to our mix. We would expect to see increasing infrastructure that impacts our ability to capture even more of that volume. However, as we've guided, we also expect for the Bakken to deliver oil growth in 2020.","Neal Dingmann","Got it. Okay. That's clever. Thanks Mitch. And then my second question, really, Lee, just more on what the guys have been talking about. Just wondering how do you balance when you think about balance in the shareholder return with the resource play exploration capital spend? And just secondly, I'm just wondering, how do you determine how much of cash -- when you have free cash flow especially though if prices go down, how do you allocate that between the two. Does that impact exploration? Or after you decide that you want to pay out a requirement amount or how is that sort of balanced?","Lee Tillman","Well, I think first of all, in the REx program, to be successful long term you do have to have a bit of a constancy of purpose. We've talked about a longer term run rate of a $2 million in REx over time. We believe that that type of investment within that resource capture framework that I described earlier will allow REx to deliver the type of resource and inventory that we will ultimately need to replace what we're consuming. So, there's a little bit of I guess reverse engineering is the way I would put it to come to the amount of investment.","Now, they're going to be put and takes in any given year. We saw some large investment years as we established the two actual acreage positions. Now, we're back really at a kind of a couple hundred million in run rate. From a return of capital standpoint, we have to really strike the right balance between obviously shorter-term returns, free cash flow generation, but also meeting these strategic objectives which are continuing to replenish our inventory and that's part of the balancing act.","Today, we certainly feel that the repurchase of our shares based on valuations is a good return and a good use of capital allocation. And it's simply again striking the balance between that and longer-term value creation that exists within the resource capture framework.","Neal Dingmann","That's clear. Thanks for all the details guys.","Operator","Our following question comes from Brian Singer.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to pick up on that topic of asset sustainability and breakeven oil prices. Can you talk a little bit more about the reserve bookings for the year and provide any more color there in terms of percent-proved developed notable revisions that impacted the reserve replacement in finding and development costs. I was going to ask how that influences your thoughts on inorganic growth, but since you've talked about that maybe you could talk about what your expectations are for reserve replacement and F&D costs from this year's budget?","Dane Whitehead","Yes. Hey, Brian. Let me at least take the first part of that. With regard to reserves, I think it's important to remember that reserves kind of follow the capital, both what we spent in 2019 and what we have in our forward plan. And in this commodity price environment as you've heard all morning here, we're allocating to drive return enhancement and that means a lot of capital going for the oil. You'll see that in our growth rates, with oil growth rates exceeding, equivalent growth rates 70% of our capital would go into Eagle Ford and Bakken, very oily assets.","And really what you see -- as you peel the layers back on our headline reserve numbers is that our reserve placement ratio for oil was well over 100%. This year even though it may boe basis be below that. And then of course in our press release we had some F&D calculations in the appendix there. The headline number is $26 a barrel, but there are some fairly significant things to know about that. We reduced capital and our Ford plan much like we did in this year's budget and almost exclusively coming out of the gas here areas in Oklahoma and that had a fairly significant north of $7 impact on F&D.","And then there are some PDP tails that come down with lower pricing, lower SEC pricing again, largely gassy. That was almost another three dollars. So if you account for all that you can get to an F&D number, that's in the $16 to $17 range which is a little bit higher than our historic three year average, but pretty much closed on trend. And when you consider the oil content, there was pretty strong.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to the Eagle Ford. You talked about some strong well performance, the best two quarters from a 30 date oil rate perspective. A, do you expect those wells to have and the performance of those wells to have? And the performance of those wells to have proportionate impact on EURs? Or should the post 30-day decline rates pick up based on either where or how they've been drilled and flowed? And then B, how do you view the depth of the remaining inventory relative to the results that you've been highlighting here for the last six months?","Mitch Little","Yes. Hey Brian, it's Mitch again. With respect to your first question there's usually some benefit to EUR from modern completions and seeing this record IP30s, but we're going to need longer dated production to prove that out or to quantify the ultimate impact. I would say as a more general statement, the initial IP30 uplift is a little bit greater than the EUR uplift across most of our plays. But we typically do see an EUR benefit as well. To your latter question I think this one is probably the most important one. We currently talk about a decade of remaining inventory in the Eagle Ford at the current levels.","And I want to make really clear a couple of things that we're working on in the organic enhancement space are additive to that. The old adage, \"Big fields keep getting bigger,\" certainly proving out for us in the Eagle Ford and Bakken where we've replaced the inventory. We've consumed the last couple of years. We've got a fair bit of activity on the redevelopment front in the Eagle Ford. We're targeting areas that were originally developed on wider spacing with early Gen completions. We now have sent seven successful pads under our belts with 100 percent success rate, spans over an area of about 25 miles east to west across our position and with the early encouragement there we've identified hundreds of remaining opportunities that we're working to prove up.","And just to be really clear, that's in addition to what's in our current PD of about 10 years of inventory. On top of that, we're well into phase two of our EOR pilot. That particular pilot is a multi-pad pilot, but we'll go through sequential cycles of missable gas injections so can flow back. We've got three cycles to-date. Completed on that that are in line and slightly exceeding model expectations. And I think what we can say from that very clearly is there's no question that the physics work across the black oil window in the Eagle Ford. And the Eagle Ford has some particular fluid characteristics and geologic characteristics that make it advantaged to most basins.","We'll continue that pilot looking to validate model results and inform, how we might expand that to a broader scale, look at optimization of the cycle parameters and durations and then refine program economics, so that we understand fully how that's going to compete within the broader portfolio which is already rich with a lot of top tier opportunities. So I think when we look at what we've already delivered in the Eagle Ford through organic enhancement uplift and additions and the excitement around both of these opportunities going forward, still a lot of running room in the Eagle Ford for us.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Lee, it looked like that the return of 2019, the return of capital to shareholders exceeded the full year 2019 organic free cash flow generation. I was wondering about the thought process there and with ample cash on the balance sheet currently is this something that could be repeated again in 2020?","Lee Tillman","Yes. In general, Jeff, what we have talked about is that organic free cash flow is going to be the governor on incremental return of capital back to shareholders. Obviously, we can't perfectly match those. But in general, when you look at our organic free cash flow across 2019 post dividend, which was about $410 million. We actually did $350 million-ish and share repurchases on that basis. So you should expect those to be in lock step with one another. Obviously, there'll be some puts and takes across quarters. But generally speaking, that's the philosophy. We're not going to obviously spend money that we don't have. And we certainly are going to do damage to our investment grade balance sheet.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you. My other question is on Slide 16, I noticed that the Marjorie and Lloyd wells were described as infills since the results were strong. Can you provide some color regarding the parent wells on the pads, vintage [ph] and spacing would be of interest?","Lee Tillman","Yes Jeff, I'm not sure I can recall all the specific details on the parent vintage. We can certainly get back to you on that. But these were two pads on four-well per section. And as I recall performance was pretty well in line with parents and certainly very strong returns as we've fine tuned our approach across all of Oklahoma and really driving significant improvements in capital efficiency across our entire position there.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, let me just follow up then, because I think that the question is there's been a lot of talk about parent child degradation. Sounds like from what you just said that there was not a lot of degradation in these child wells relative to the parents on the pads. Is that fair?","Lee Tillman","Yes. That's fair. And there's a lot of work that goes into optimizing our development approach here. And looking carefully at both landing zone, completion style and well spacing all contribute to that. We've made some really important inroads on all of those elements over the past few years.","Unidentified Analyst","And if I could just follow-up on that slide with one more question. I noticed in the footnotes that it looked like you were suggesting that the well cost was less than $5 million. Do you happen to remember what the average lateral lengths were on those wells?","Lee Tillman","I think they were 7500-footer, Jeff. If that's incorrect, we'll get back to you and correct that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Yes. Looks like a really competitive cost, which is why I was asking.","Lee Tillman","Yes. No Jeff, you're spot on one of the reasons beyond the productivity of the wells that we wanted to highlight the Marjorie and Lloyd pads was in fact the ability to drive the completed well costs lower and even on a normalized basis you can see that the costs there are very competitive. And as you point out in the footnotes, the actual costs are very impressive as well.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Heikkinen.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. Your operating efficiency last year added 10% to 15% more wells than the original plan and your CapEx was in line, given your efficiency and savings. As you think about the plan this year, you talked a little bit about efficiency and savings. Would you would you increase your well count again? Or what's the outcome in 2020 and 2021?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well, David, certainly we tried to provide some guidance within the deck on notionally the range of growth operated completed wells we expect for the year. Clearly, we've taken the efficiency gains that we've seen on both the drilling and the completion side, which have been substantial in 2019 and those have been of course applied into the forward plan. To the extent that we continue to see further improvement on top of those assumptions we'll obviously have to moderate and pace our activity accordingly.","But from our standpoint it just goes back to our budget is our budget. We will optimize always within that budget. But that's our development capital number, the 2.2. And to the extent that we see more efficiency, we'll have to accommodate that within that $2.2 billion budget.","Unidentified Analyst","So you spend the money on drilling and you just get more wells as opposed to returning to shareholders or building more cash balance?","Lee Tillman","Well, obviously we want to make sure that we deliver across all of our commitments, David, we want to make sure that we're delivering first and foremost on returns the free cash flow generation and then obviously getting it back to shareholders. And in many most respects the volume metric is just an outcome of that of that process.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe I'm thinking about last year wrong and if you had those savings and the efficiency you could have delivered a lower budget and better cash returns, but you'd made the same CapEx plan and delivered more wells instead? Am I thinking about that wrong?","Lee Tillman","Well, I think that one of the other though advantages was we still had investment opportunities that allowed us to continue to drive our corporate level returns higher. So we did have good investable opportunities that were represented even by that bit higher well count and we felt that that competed very favorably against returning some of that back to shareholders, which again we still returned $350 million back to shareholders on share repurchases and another $160 million on dividend. So over $500 million back to shareholders last year.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. You you'll have a great track record of free cash flow. I was just trying to answer the question of more free cash flow that it seemed like others were asking about earlier. So, thanks guys.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Lee Tillman for final remarks.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.

Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Zach Dailey. You may begin.","Zach Dailey - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Paulette, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Last night we issued a press release, slide presentation, and investor packet that address our second quarter results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO; Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations; and Guy Baber, our new VP of Investor Relations.","It's been a pleasure working with everyone in IR over the last several years.

I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee who will provide a few opening remarks before we turn to Q&A.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach, and I want to extend my welcome to Guy as well and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. With half of the year behind us, our outstanding operational execution across our differentiated position in the four best U.S. resource plays is driving improved corporate level returns and enabling us to exceed our production commitments for the quarter and for the full year.","Through the compelling combination of better well performance and greater drilling and completion efficiencies, we've raised our guidance for annual improvement in corporate cash returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share as well as annual oil and boe production growth for total company and the U.S. resource plays. All of this with no change to our $2.3 billion development capital budget and while adjusting for recently divested non-core oil volumes.","While development CapEx has been slightly weighted to the first half of the year we expect to see our working interest moderate across the U.S. resource plays, consistent with the planned well mix for the second half of 2018.","Our outstanding operational execution coupled with our capital discipline and higher oil prices enabled us to generate about $250 million of organic free cash flow during the second quarter, building upon our already peer-leading financial flexibility. This developing trend enhances our confidence and sustainable free cash flow and gives us ample room to progress multiple high-return uses of cash.","Though all options are on the table our philosophy has not changed. It starts with a superior balance sheet and ensuring adequate cash on hand to run the business. Continued discipline on our $2.3 billion development capital program regardless of commodity pricing; appropriately funding low cost, high quality resource play exploration with the goal of generating outsized full cycle returns; maintaining optionality around small bolt-on opportunities in the Northern Delaware and also in our other U.S. resource plays; large M&A however is not our focus; and returning cash to shareholders.","We have a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place and are already funding our existing $170 million annual dividend. Our framework stresses line of sight to sustainable free cash flow generation while striking the right balance between low-cost resource capture and direct return of capital to shareholders. In the current pricing environment, we are increasingly confident we can do both. We recognize that resource capture opportunities will be episodic and will include greenfield leasing, exploration drilling and seismic, as well as small bolt-ons. As such, we must be prepared to act thoughtfully but also quickly when such opportunities meet our criteria. To that end, we spent about $250 million in the first half of 2018, predominantly on leasing in the emerging Austin Chalk play in Louisiana, and expect another $100 million to $150 million of REx CapEx in the second half of the year when we'll spud our first exploration well in Louisiana.","Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. Impressive well results continue to confirm our expanded core in both our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions. Significantly enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County are uplifting economics and inventory quality while both assets continue to generate significant free cash flow. Bakken grew oil production 14% sequentially, and continued its basin-leading performance with the Winona and Mamie wells in West Myrmidon setting new basin oil records for the Three Forks with average IP 30s greater than 3,000 barrels of oil per day.","Our successful expansion of enhanced completion designs into Elk Creek elevates the economic returns for yet another area within our overall lease position. As we continue to bring on basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all North Dakota requirements and expect no flow assurance issues as we continue to develop this high-return program.","Eagle Ford production grew 2% sequentially with another quarter of consistent results from the 39 wells we brought to sales which delivered average IP 30s of about 1,900 boe per day at a 66% oil cut. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in well performance with 90-day cumulative production up 50% relative to 2016. The Eagle Ford again contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were once again above WTI.","In Oklahoma, we are shifting from STACK leasehold protection to primarily multi-well pad development in both the overpressured STACK and the SCOOP Woodford. That development focus is delivering results with the SCOOP Woodford in-fill, the four-well Lightner pad on a half section boasting an impressive IP 30 of over 2,600 boe per day from lateral links that average 6,800 feet. Importantly, initial oil cuts exceeded expectations at almost 50%, placing these among some of the best Woodford oil wells in the play.","Though our Oklahoma wells to sales were weighted to the first half of the year, our remaining 2018 completions will come primarily from the Irven John and HR Potter overpressured STACK infills. The majority of the team's activity in the second half of the year will be focused on drilling multi-well infill pads that won't come to sales until 2019.","In the Northern Delaware, we've made great progress capturing drilling and completion efficiencies including a 45% improvement in average drilling feet per day since the fourth quarter and averaging nine frac stages per day on the three-well Fiddle Fee pad. These efficiencies allowed us to move from five to four rigs in June while maintaining our original 2018 guidance of 50 to 55 wells to sales.","On takeaway, though an important growth asset, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 5% of our production mix for the quarter but we are already advancing midstream solutions that beyond protecting flow assurance, maximize margins through enhanced realizations and LOE reduction. Specifically, we've expanded our oil gathering agreements and are finalizing a term oil sales agreement. And we just recently executed a water handling agreement in the Malaga area that will significantly reduce our unit LOE. All of this is supported by our Midland-Cushing basis hedges at a discount of less than $1 to WTI.","Outside of our four U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in EG which contributed over $190 million of EBITDAX for the quarter. Also in Q2, we executed an HOA to process backfill gas from the Alen field through our LNG plant on Bioko Island. We continue to view our EG infrastructure as being uniquely positioned to become the natural point of aggregation in the region to capture additional equity and third-party gas.","I've always said that we'll never be done with portfolio management and along those lines we recently closed on the sale of three non-core non-operated conventional assets in the U.S. These assets contributed 5,000 boe per day in the first half of the year and were about 75% oil. Even with these volumes adjusted out we still raised total company 2018 oil and boe guidance. We are also on track to fully exit Kurdistan before year-end, representing our 8th country exit since 2013.","Second quarter has again demonstrated the strength of our returns-driven multi-basin business model. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities without being forced to accelerate into headwinds. We remain solidly on track to deliver a strong rate of change in our key financial performance metrics with a 70% annual improvement in corporate cash return at strip while also delivering free cash flow.","In the second half of the year we'll continue to focus on consistent execution while managing those elements of our business within our control: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio simplification, that collectively generate compelling corporate returns with profitable growth and outcome.","Thank you. And with that I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lee, I think your consistent execution really deserves to be applauded because I think you've really done a great job turning this thing around since you came here. So, just wanted to say congratulations on a great quarter.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I did want to make a couple of questions regarding the cadence of your relative activity going into the balance of this year and then into next. First of all, in the Bakken \u2013 I've only got two questions by the way. First of all, on the Bakken, it looks like you've got quite a wide range of variability across those Three Forks wells. I'm just wondering if you can touch on what's driving, I mean, tremendous wells on the one hand but obviously you've got some wells at the other end of the spectrum as well. So, what was driving the differences in completion? What's gone into the underlying decline rate with your ESP strategy? And just give us some idea of what \u2013 how you see the cadence of the Bakken over the next, let's say, through the plan period, through 2020?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, maybe I'll take a little bit of that question and then also let Mitch chime in, Doug. First of all, just on cadence, per our plan this year, we are going to have a bit of waiting from a well to sales standpoint in the fourth quarter. So, you should expect to see that as the year plays out. From an overall activity standpoint, we continue to try to maintain a level of activity that optimizes, if you will, the continuity in our crews both on the drilling and the completion side in the Bakken. With the success though that we have seen particularly in the Hector area and certainly and not only the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to be very encouraged about what Bakken activity might look like as we begin planning for 2019.","And in terms of variability and I'll let Mitch maybe chime in a little bit on that, we are going to see some natural variability across the play as the geology varies. But having said that, I think when you look at the consistent outperformance using our enhanced completion designs, that is very much a common element.","And then from an artificial lift perspective, we continue to take full advantage of the best available technology. We think managing the life of the well is equally as important as generating early IP 30s. And so our team and the asset is very focused on how best to optimize using not only ESPs but also other forms of artificial lift.","So with that maybe Mitch, if you want to chime in anything else, just on the Three Forks specifically.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Doug. I think Lee covered it at a high level pretty well. What I would say is we've talked about before the tremendous technical database that we have here and the integrated workflow that we've applied on a sub-regional basis to optimize across the play.","Lee aptly noted we do see some geologic variation across the play and we've also talked in the past about instilling a culture where we're never satisfied with yesterday's results. So, we still continue to trial various designs which would alter pumping strategy, proppant loading, and diversion technology. And so some of the variability is driven by those trials as we look to optimize on a return basis across the entire play. But in aggregate with the expansion of the core into Hector and now Elk Creek when you look at performance in aggregate being up over 100% since 2016, I feel good about the capability and the commitment of the team there to continue to drive further improvements.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Forgive me guys, if I can just get kind of a clarification on here. Is it a work over-risk with an ESP strategy or as these things \u2013 has liquid volumes increased with increase with water content and so on or is that not an issue?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","We've got a pretty extensive use of ESPs that we've migrated to over the last few years in the Bakken. We see that as a way to uplift returns through maximizing production through the early phases of the well life. And so I don't \u2013 I'm not entirely sure I understand or if I'm answering your question on work over-risk but we've got dozens of ESPs in the ground, longest of which are probably more than three years old or have been in service for more than three years. And so it's a natural part of our business up there is probably how I would characterize it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","And if could just add...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Go ahead, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","...clearly we're always focused on how to enhance the reliability of ESPs and we keep a very close watch on mean time between failures, which of course, these are pumps and over time they will have wear and tear on them. And so the further that we can extend that useful life of ESPs, that will obviously cut down on the intervention required from a well work standpoint.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Lee. My follow-up is just a real quick one. Are you comfortable with the current rig allocation after moving the rig out of the Delaware? And is the connectivity in the Delaware enough to achieve your HPP requirements? So, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, absolutely. Well, first of all, just for absolute clarity on the rig drop in Permian, that was really driven by the excellent work from the Permian D&C teams there that have really captured very really early in our cycle there in Northern Delaware some significant efficiency gains. And what that has translated into is that we could deliver our program which was designed to not only protect our leasehold but also generate learnings as we get into the early kind of appraisal kind of drilling work that we're doing there. And we could do that all and do it with less rigs and match those rigs up with the dedicated frac crew that we're running in the basin.","So, that was a great outcome and it's purely efficiency-driven and again matching up with the one dedicated frac crew. We are without a doubt going to achieve all of the objectives there that we set out for 2018 around not only leasehold but also continuing to understand the basin. We had some multi-well pads that we even talked about this quarter. So, that work is all on track.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks for your time, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hi, Brian. Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","You highlighted your ability to execute on three uses of capital, or for free cash flow: resource capture, bolt-ons, and return of capital to shareholders. Can you talk about the buffer you would want to see in your balance sheet for the first two of those to have more confidence and to execute on the third, return of capital to shareholders, i.e. what are you looking for to kind of pull the trigger on share repurchase within or beyond your existing authorization?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. Brian, I think the best way to think about it is first of all on the balance sheet side, I think with all the great work done by the team in 2017, we feel very comfortable with the way we have the balance sheet positioned. When we look at net debt to EBITDAX on a forward-looking basis, we feel very comfortable with how we position that. So, we can kind of I believe set that one to the side. We don't have another maturity until well out in time, 2021, so I think let's just kind of park that one.","I think coming back to what are we looking for, I think we've been very consistent in the messaging there which has been around, we want to see sustainable free cash flow being generated from our model before looking at incremental direct return of capital to our shareholders. Now, I say incremental because of course we do still have what within our peer group is still a very competitive dividend that we're paying.","I think as we continue to gain that confidence and see this trend, it really started in earnest this quarter with $250 million of organic cash flow and we used organic cash flow because we think that's more indicative of the underlying performance of the business. But as we look at that and gain that confidence and look out in time, I think we're getting more comfortable that we can accommodate not only the needs we have in resource capture, but also looking at options to return directly to shareholders.","And as you stated, we have the authorization in place. We are certainly not going to preannounce any execution though against our existing authorization.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to the Bakken. You highlighted your ability to apply enhanced completion techniques outside of the core with the Bear Den pad and I wondered if you could add any color on how widespread those implications are to your noncore Bakken position and any further plans there versus more of a regional impressive well performance in this area.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think just again to put Elk Creek in a little bit of perspective, it still is a really \u2013 it's still a constrained area there. It's not as aerially extensive as what you would see in Hector. But what it does is it continues to confirm our ability to go in and not only predict performance but be successful at delivering against that prediction.","I think what we want to think about though is that we have two very key tests coming up in the remainder of the year. One of those is pushing further south in our Hector acreage, more to the south of that place, so we feel very good about the northern part of Hector and feel that we have essentially de-risked that and moved it into the core. But we do have a test to the south and then the other test of course will be in the Ajax area. And both of those tests will be later in the second half of the year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. You made a point in the press release and the verbal comments to highlight the lack of gas flaring on your North Dakota acreage. I don't think you've drawn attention to that issue before. Did something change policy, regulatory, anything like that that encouraged you to kind of single that out?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","No. Not at all. In fact, the reason we wanted to highlight that is just to assure folks that as we see more activity in the basin, as you know, North Dakota continues to their regulatory regime around gas capture that we kept everyone up to speed on our view of that, and that we are not only in full compliance but certainly don't see any impacts on our four development plan there. So, it's really just more competence setting. And I think it's also important too. I know that the state does put out data on flaring and sometimes that can get confused relative to actual compliance. And we wanted to be absolutely clear that we were in full compliance, no impact relative to our forward development there in the Bakken.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. In Q2, you had 13,000 boe a day of U.S. production outside of the big four resource plays. And your solds looks like 4,000 of that since. Where is that \u2013 the remainder, I guess 9,000 boe a day?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. It's kind of distributed out. There's still a bit of an element in the Gulf of Mexico. We still have a couple of small assets in the Gulf that are largely contributing to that bottom line in the North \u2013 in the remaining kind of North America production.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And are you \u2013 is it safe to say that you would be looking to kind of continue cleaning that up?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think we're kind of in the nits and nats at this point in the U.S. They're smaller, if you will, assets but we'll continue to look to monetize those to the advantage of the shareholder just like we did in the current quarter. And it's just part, as I said in my opening comments, we never view portfolio management as being done. We're constantly looking to upgrade, simplify and concentrate the portfolio and you should expect us to continue to do so.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate it.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Pavel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamaal Dardar from TPH & Company. Please go ahead.","Jamaal Dejon Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning.","Jamaal Dejon Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just had a quick question. You mentioned looking at the free cash flow in your model in order to determine maybe the pace and execution of buybacks. I just wanted to get a sense though at current strip ballpark what you all are seeing in terms of free cash flow over that 2021 plan?","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","2021? We haven't talked about \u2013 hey...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Jamaal.","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","Jamaal, sorry, this is Dane Whitehead. Yeah. We really don't forecast out to 2021 but we want to think about the rest of 2018. I think the fact that we generated $250 million of organic free cash flow in Q2 and a commodity price environment that is very similar to what we're looking at for the balance of the year right now, it's kind of reasonable to think that we will generate that kind of ratably for the rest of the year.","Jamaal Dejon Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. That sounds good. And just moving operationally, you saw some really good results here in the oily Woodford play that we haven't seen in a while from you all. Just kind of want to get an update on the size of the opportunity set there. We haven't been updated on the resource in some time and I guess the data disclosure was that maybe that was a little lower working interest. So I just kind of want to get an update there.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. Jamaal, this is Mitch. I might refer you to slide 12 where we kind of highlight the near-term activity in Oklahoma. And you'll note a number of multi-well infill pads down in the SCOOP area, in the general area of the Lightner. We have been talking about for the last couple of quarters this pivot from STACK leasehold protection to a focus on infill development drilling in high confidence areas in the overpressured STACK and SCOOP. We think we've got plenty of running room in and around the Lightner. You see the near-term activity there. I think that Lightner is a really good indicator of the type of deliverability and returns that we would expect from that area.","We would expect some variability in oil cut. As we highlighted the Lightner came in above expectations on oil cut but from a returns and deliverability perspective the activity that we've highlighted there for the remainder of 2018 in terms of infill drilling pads should expect similar kind of economic results as we saw in the Lightner.","Jamaal Dejon Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. That makes sense. Great results there. So, just want to see if we could \u2013 that will be repeatable. I appreciate the time, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Jamaal.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, and good results in the quarter. Congratulations. I was thinking through and comparing other companies in the Delaware. Many pointed to higher OBO spending driving higher CapEx. I was just wondering if you guys are seeing the same trend in OBO that could impact your budget for the remainder of the year?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Dave. This is Lee. Just \u2013 you know, I'll maybe address OBO just in general. It's an element of our business that's particularly relevant in both Oklahoma and Northern Delaware. It's also notoriously one of the more challenging ones for us to predict and build into our modeling as well because you're somewhat reliant on the feedback that you get from the other operators. And of course their plans change, their capital allocation may change, their timing and pace may change. But I think in general what I would say is that we've had to, like many, watch very carefully the OBO spend.","And we treat OBO spend just like we would our own operated spend, we're returns-driven. And if we don't see adequate returns, then we will not support those investments. So, with activity increases, there will be a natural bias up in not only operated activity, but also non-operated activity. So, it's just like any element of our business. We're managing it. We're managing it based on returns, and it's fully contemplated in our $2.3 billion capital budget.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I'm not trying to read between the lines. Does that say that you've got plenty of free cash flow? So, it really is just purely returns. You're not drawing a hard line on $2.3 billion. Like, commodity prices are up. So, I'd expect returns would be good.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So, just in Oklahoma and Delaware, that biased your budget a little higher just given activity level.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I would say within the $2.3 billion obviously there's been puts and takes throughout the year. OBO is just one element of that but we are going to support higher return opportunities whether they'll be non-operated or operated. And but it has to come in and compete for capital allocation just like any piece of our business. So, no, we're not going to artificially constrain and make poor business decisions.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. I didn't think so. Thanks, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Devin.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask on the resource play exploration strategy. You've acquired a large position in the Austin Chalk at this point. As you noted, an attractive low cost of entry. As we think about how that strategy there plays out over the next several years and the overall spending profile for resource play exploration. Is it now going to focus more on the exploration and appraisal in the Austin Chalk? And that's where that spending will largely be bucketed or are there other opportunities that you continue to look at beyond that as we move toward getting more information on Austin Chalk over the next several years.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, certainly the REx opportunity set is much broader than just Austin Chalk. There are numerous opportunities that that team has actively engaged in today. I would point out though that Austin Chalk and Louisiana, it is a unique opportunity in terms of its scale and the entry point there. And so elements of that will be somewhat difficult to replicate in some of the other opportunities, so it is unique in that sense. So as difficult as it is to forecast this part of our business, I would say that the pace of spend certainly that we saw in the first half of the year which was largely dominated by Louisiana Austin Chalk that was a pretty unique opportunity set.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And the other question I had is actually shifting over to international, Equatorial Guinea you highlighted in the context of potentially being a regional hub for growth in that area, I was wondering if you just add a little bit of color on what the opportunities that is that you see there, if that's an asset where we could see growth over time and just how you're framing that.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think that our starting point is we have a \u2013 we are very uniquely positioned in EG with that integrated gas infrastructure that we have there. We also know that there is not only the opportunity that we're currently pursuing which is the Alen field and bringing it in as backfill gas. But we know that there's regional gas in the area that ultimately we'll need to find a monetization route.","Some of that within EG. Some of it maybe even outside of EG. But geographically this is a very well-positioned asset and infrastructure. We know that the EG government is very keen to continue to progress their role in regional gas development and we're going to support that initiative.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess if we could. Hey. If we could come back a little bit the question was asked earlier about share repos. I believe on the last conference call you kind of gave an idea of the amount of cash you would want to have on hand. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to what you'd like the balance sheet to look like before you considered increase shareholder returns whether it's a share repo or a dividend increase.","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Roger, this is Dane again. We feel like as Lee said earlier, we feel great about where the balance sheet is right now from a leverage perspective, net debt to EBITDA is trending sub 1 time which is I think kind of top of the peer group. And we don't have any current maturities, next one's in 2020 and it's $600 million, so easy to handle one way or another.","From a managing the business perspective, we've been pretty consistent saying it's nice to have that $750 million in cash on hand. Interim month, we see some fairly significant swings as receivables come in, as payables go out, and we also want to have a little bit of flexibility to do bolt-ons or other REx activity from time to time with short notice.","So that's sort of the minimum operating level we'd like to maintain. We're feeling \u2013 obviously we're in a better position right now than that from a cash perspective which gives us the flexibility to do the things that Lee mentioned in his opening comments. I mean, we can balance our approach with adding future inventory at low cost that can generate high full cycle returns and also give you consideration of return of capital to shareholders.","And so we feel pretty good about that and as we continue to generate free cash for the balance of the year that will give us additional flexibility.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I guess a follow-up on that. So obviously, the move here into the Austin Chalk, relatively attractive lease costs. As you think about acquisitions, is there anything on the larger scale at this point that looks interesting or attractive or it's really we should think more of the smaller, I guess you described bolt-on type positions?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, Roger. This is Lee. Absolutely, we are focused squarely on the smaller bolt-ons. Larger-scale acquisitions simply are not on our radar screen. We feel that there have been \u2013 there are some really unique opportunities in and around our core basins that are in that kind of small bolt-on category. You'll recall that we did one in 4Q in the Northern Delaware.","And so, that's the type of opportunity that we're going to continue to look at to \u2013 what we'd like to do of course is to continue to take advantage of the amazing execution being delivered by our teams in these core assets and it's going to be hard pressed for others to demonstrate that they can drive more value but we want those, even those smaller acquisitions to come in and compete for capital allocation from a full cycle basis. So, that's the criteria that even those will have to meet to get in through the door.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And if I could just throw in one last one and it's into the weeds, but on the OBO issues where you're not funding, you're choosing not to go forward with that, any \u2013 SCOOP\/STACK you highlighted, but is that the leading resource play where you're seeing that or is it spread across Eagle Ford, Permian, Bakken, et cetera?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","So first of all, I want to be really clear. We do not expect to be in a non-consent position on a lot of opportunities. That's not our expectation. I mean, we expect operators are going to bring forward their best opportunities just like we are. But the areas where we have the larger non-operated exposure are Oklahoma and Northern Delaware. Both of those teams have an economic criteria that they test all opportunities against, and then we make a decision on that basis. And also bear in mind that leases may have different terms associated with them too around participation. And so, all of that will factor into our forward-looking decision.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Regarding the Austin Chalk, when will we hear test results? Will that be more beginning of the next year, Lee?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","John, we're \u2013 as you know, very, very early days here. We're looking to spud the initial well in later this year. Meaningful results are going to be later in 2019. Clearly, this is an exploration play, and I want to remind everyone of that. So, it's going to take us a bit of time to get our arms around what the data is really telling us. And it is going to be a relatively limited data set even at that point in time. In parallel, we're also participating in a multi-client seismic survey, which is also going to support whatever well results we get. So, the integration of all of that data is ultimately what will decide whether or not this is something that we want to take into more of a development mode.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. Assuming it does go ahead, how's the infrastructure there in terms of access in, you know, midstream, et cetera?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, clearly there in some areas of the Chalk in Louisiana there has been I would say more conventional development that kind of goes back into the kind of the 1990s. But I would say that infrastructure will be one of those areas that we have to focus on initially and ensuring that we get out in front of that. But from a geographic location standpoint I like being close to the Gulf Coast. I like the fact that this is an area where there has been hydrocarbon development in the past. So in that way it's very similar to places like Oklahoma and South Texas where even though we brought in the unconventionals there was a conventional business there that kind of came in before us. And of course we're going to certainly enjoy having indexing more to an LLS basis than somewhere else.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hello. Can you hear me? Hello?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Go ahead, Vin. We've got you, I think.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. It's Paul Sankey here.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Oh. Hi, Paul. How are you doing?","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","I jumped on to Vin's line and maybe we should get him \u2013 force him to ask the question but I don't think he's expecting to. I'm always fascinated by your position right across the U.S. unconventionals. It seems to me it must be very challenging to plan given the scale of changes that we're seeing whether it's in differentials, whether it's geologic performance. And of course I was wondering as well how cost is changing in the different regions. Could you talk a bit about all of those things? It feels perhaps like the Bakken is much more attractive now based on transport differentials. It feels like Oklahoma might be dropping off a bit geologically. And then your perspective on drilling and completion costs as well. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Certainly the multi-basin model in our opinion offers a lot of advantages but it does require a level of planning and optimization that is different than if you were in a single basin mode. There are a lot of different factors that go in. Obviously, you're getting new performance data each and every day. You're getting new cost data. You're getting new realization data each and every day.","So, our planning processes, we have completely overhauled them to reflect the realities of the unconventional plays which means capital allocation is no longer a once a year exercise. It's something that we do in real time. And so, you should expect to see us continue to adjust and flex as we see developments in each of the individual basins. And whether that's some type of dislocation from a realization standpoint or some kind of dislocation even on a cost standpoint, we do have the ability to reflect that in our allocations going forward.","There's little doubt though that when you look at somewhere like a Bakken where you've had the combination of both productivity gains, strong realizations, and continued reduction in the cost structure that those barrels are going to be extremely competitive even within our multi-basin model and that's why you see us driving a lot of capital that direction in this year's plan. So, that was our perspective when we started the year. I think the \u2013 probably the pleasant surprise for us has been the sheer outperformance of what had traditionally been these non-core areas like Hector and seeing them compete head to head with the Tier 1 inventory that we have across all of our basins.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Right. And then of course, I've seen that the Tier 1 has a cost disadvantage because of the larger amount of activity in those area.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think it varies. I think a lot of kudos to our supply chain group and the operations team's working with them that they have continued to find innovative ways to control our cost structure whether that is looking discreetly at things like local and regional sourcing of materials, including sand. I think the month of June we sourced all of our sand locally in the Permian for instance.","So we're looking for instance at continuing to assess ways to broaden our vendor population and open up our services to a broader cross-section of vendors. And we're even considering potentially terming up some element of our activity to ensure that again we not only have the security of well-trained, strongly executing crews but also can potentially lock in some favorable commercial terms.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Interesting.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn it over to Guy Baber, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Guy Baber","Thank you, Brandon. Thank you to everyone for joining us this morning on the call. Yesterday after the close we issued a press release, a slide presentation and an investor packet that address our third quarter results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO; Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations; and Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy. As always, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who'll provide his opening remarks.","We will then open the call up to Q&A.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Guy. And thank you to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter once again featured exceptional execution across all aspects of our business. This consistent differentiated execution against a transparent framework for capital discipline is driving compelling bottom line financial outcomes for our shareholders that compete not only against our independent E&P peers, but more importantly, against the broader market as well.","We continue to consistently and comprehensively deliver against our framework for success, which defines our brand of capital discipline. We are driving our corporate returns higher, generating sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing, prioritizing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and improving our capital efficiency, cost structure and resource base, including the just announced addition of over 1,000 operated locations, all through differentiated execution.","Our strong operational and financial performance continues to be powered by a transformed multi-basin portfolio and a top-tier balance sheet, the foundations for our continued success.","Turning to third quarter highlights. I will start my commentary by addressing the strong financial outcomes we have now delivered for multiple quarters that serve as proof points for our business strategy and that define our investment case. It starts with our returns-first orientation.","On a year-to-date basis, our annualized cash return on invested capital is 20%, consistent with the prior year, despite a 12% decline in WTI prices and meaningful weakness in NGL and gas pricing. This underlying corporate returns improvement is an outcome of our success across multiple dimensions: portfolio management, concentrated capital allocation, more efficient operations, high-margin oil growth, lower cash costs and well cost reductions. Additionally, it is this returns-first mindset that drives our comprehensive framework for ongoing resource capture and enhancement. More on that in just a moment.","Second is our commitment to sustainable free cash flow generation at conservative pricing. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of post-dividend organic free cash flow generation and our now well-established track record on this front remains unique in the sector.","We generated $81 million of post-dividend organic free cash flow during 3Q bringing our year-to-date organic free cash flow to approximately $300 million. Since the beginning of 2018, our cumulative post-dividend organic free cash flow totals over $1.1 billion. This translates to an annualized organic free cash flow yield of approximately 6% on a year-to-date basis and 9% since 2018, leading our E&P peer group and competitive with the S&P 500.","Third, we continue to return significant capital back to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased $300 million of our own shares, funded entirely with post-dividend organic free cash flow.","Since the beginning of 2018, cumulative repurchases now total $1 billion, representing approximately 7% of our outstanding share count and again funded entirely by post-dividend organic free cash flow. And over the same time period, we have returned 25% of our cash flow from operations back to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases.","We have a $1.45 billion repurchase authorization outstanding and continue to believe that a balanced approach to share repurchases governed by organic free cash flow offers a great return to our shareholders. Our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions is further underscored by a return of capital metric within our executive compensation scorecard.","Finally, differentiated execution is the engine that powers delivery against all of our commitments. And third quarter was again a quarter long on execution proof points. High margin U.S. oil production exceeded the top end of our guidance and we are now guiding to full year U.S. oil growth of 13% versus 12% previously.","Development CapEx during third quarter was in line with expectations and our annual $2.4 billion development capital budget remains unchanged. Completed well costs per lateral foot remain on a declining trend in all basins. Unit production costs in both the U.S. and International segments are at record lows, since we became an independent E&P in 2011. And success across all elements of our returns-focused resource capture and enhancement framework is delivering on its promise adding about three years of drilling inventory.","This success coupled with our extensive portfolio transformation and differentiated position in four of the best U.S. resource plays, means large-scale M&A is not a consideration.","Lastly we continue to take proactive steps to enhance our already peer-leading balance sheet. We executed three separate transactions that are leverage-neutral, extend maturities and generate cash savings. Importantly, we are investment-grade at all three primary ratings agencies.","Briefly touching on the asset-specific third quarter operational highlights, that are underpinning our enterprise financial success. In the Eagle Ford, we continue to deliver compelling financial returns and meaningful free cash flow. During third quarter, we achieved a new record for oil productivity as measured on an average IP30 basis an impressive accomplishment after eight years of operating in the play as our team continues to harness learnings from our 1700-plus horizontal completions in the Eagle Ford.","Beyond another productivity record with our focus on all drivers of capital efficiency we are making great progress in reducing well costs with third quarter completed well costs per lateral foot 10% below the 2018 average.","Further, we continue to organically add and upgrade the economic quality of our inventory most notably through a successful redevelopment test in core Karnes County taking advantage of understimulated our early generation completion designs.","In the Bakken, we continue to build on our hard-earned reputation as a best-in-basin operator. Capital efficiency continues to impress with our average completed well costs down to just $4.9 million during third quarter a 20% reduction relative to 2018. We also are seeing encouraging early results from another South Hector core extension test, marked by strong initial oil rates and a basin-leading average completed well cost of only $4.5 million.","Extended production data continues to validate the economics of 2018 delineation tests in both South Hector and Ajax with average well payouts of about 10 months on actual costs and pricing. In Oklahoma, we have reduced our activity down to four rigs as part of a concentrated program in the more oily and more economically competitive areas of the play as we protect our returns in a challenged gas and NGL pricing environment and maintain our focus on free cash flow generation.","In the over-pressured STACK we continue to deliver consistently strong and predictable performance along with some of the lowest completed well costs in the play. In the oily SCOOP Springer early productivity from our first three operated wells this year is, outperforming type curve expectations affirming the confidence we have in the additional 9 Springer wells, we will bring to sales during fourth quarter. ","Turning to Northern Delaware. We continue to protect our leasehold, delineate our position and improve our margins all while driving capital efficiency improvement particularly in the Upper Wolfcamp and our Malaga area, where third quarter delivered a 35% increase in well productivity coupled with a 20% reduction in well costs relative to 2018.","Looking ahead fourth quarter activity will shift to include more delineation work in the attractive Red Hills area of our footprint. Internationally, we closed on the sale of our U.K. asset during third quarter simplifying our international portfolio to our free cash flow generating integrated business in EG.","Our integrated EG asset delivered approximately $100 million of EBITDAX during third quarter with unit production costs of less than $2 per BOE. The third-party Alen backfill gas project remains on schedule with first gas expected in the first half of 2021.","We believe there is inherent strength in a portfolio of quality assets that span the development cycle from exploration through the full field development and EOR. We have previously shared our comprehensive framework for resource capture and inventory replacement and this quarter we are providing aggregate results that demonstrate the success and impact of this approach.","This framework is designed to continue improving an already robust resource base through a sustainable multifaceted effort, all fully consistent with our returns-first orientation. Importantly we are generating success across all three elements of this strategy: organic enhancement resource play exploration or REx and the bolt-on acquisitions and trades.","The combined success the result of disciplined capital allocation and a constancy of purpose has been transformative resulting in the addition of over 1000 company-operated locations to our inventory equivalent to roughly three years of company-wide drilling.","Complementary to these additional locations. the economic returns of hundreds of existing Eagle Ford and Bakken drilling locations have been significantly upgraded. Given the importance, I would like to spend a few moments on each of the three elements of this framework.","Our success starts with what we call organic enhancement or core extension through productivity uplift, enhanced recovery, cost reduction and efficiency improvement. In the Bakken and Eagle Ford alone organic enhancement has resulted in the addition of over 500 new drilling locations to our plan of development since the beginning of 2018, more than replacing the last two years of inventory consumption for both assets. ","At the same time we have meaningfully enhanced the economic returns of nearly every remaining drillable location in the Bakken and Eagle Ford with hundreds of existing locations upgraded to top tier. As a result, the vast majority of our approximate decade of inventory in both plays offers compelling economics. And while, the bulk of both our future Bakken and Eagle Ford inventory has been meaningfully upgraded on an economic basis, we continue to believe ","And while the bulk of both our future Bakken and Eagle Ford inventory has been meaningfully upgraded on an economic basis, we continue to believe there is more resource to unlock, through additional core extension in the Bakken, through redevelopment opportunities in the Eagle Ford and even through enhanced oil recovery with our Phase 2 EOR pilot in the Eagle Ford demonstrating encouraging early results.","Additionally, our organic enhancement workflows, the product of years of disciplined work are fully transferable to our less mature assets in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware, another example of the power of our high-performing multi-basin model.","The second element of our resource capture enhancement framework is our resource play exploration program or Rex, the objective of which is to drive outsized full cycle returns through low-entry costs, high-quality exploration at scale. We are pleased to announce we are now advancing exploration and appraisal activity in two oil plays of scale, including a new Texas Delaware oil play with potential for over 400 extended lateral locations.","This new oil play spans over 60,000 net acres of contiguous oily leasehold perspective for both Woodford and Meramec oil targets. The play exhibits outstanding reservoir characteristics with the Woodford over 350 feet thick, more than 700 feet of separation between the Woodford and Meramec intervals and two excellent source rocks.","After securing our initial acreage position in 2018, we have since drilled and completed two exploration tests this year. Early results from these first two Woodford exploration wells are robust, demonstrating all the attributes we were hoping to prove in the play: strong oil deliverability, low water-oil ratios and shallow decline profiles.","We kept this promising early exploration well performance very tight, which allowed our team to move swiftly and surgically to fully capture what we had identified as the sweet spot of the play through targeted acquisitions that we expect to close in the fourth quarter.","With our focus on full cycle returns, we established our position at a low entry cost of less than $2400 per acre. We expect to deploy a full rig line for appraisal and delineation in 2020 as we continue to progress our understanding of this exciting new opportunity.","Separately in the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we continue to advance our exploration program. We welcome Equinor as a new 25% non-operating working interest partner in the play. On a cash basis, our partnership helps fund the incremental REx acquisition spending during fourth quarter related to coring up our new Texas Delaware oil play.","Just as a reminder, our Louisiana acreage is focused in what we characterize as the western fairway of the play in the over-pressured volatile oil and condensate phase windows. Our core position has largely never been drilled. And in fact, a material portion had never been leased for oil and gas operations and is on trend with historic Austin Chalk wells that have delivered prolific cumulative oil production even though developed by short laterals with no modern stimulation. Results from our first Austin Chalk exploration well are expected early next year with additional activity planned for 2020.","The third and final element of our resource capture and enhancement framework includes bolt-on acquisitions and trades to further bolster existing core positions. To that end, we are pleased to announce an Eagle Ford bolt-on that satisfies all of our key criteria: contiguous, largely undeveloped with inventory upside, industrial logic with meaningful synergies and accretive financial return.","This acquisition includes approximately 18,000 contiguous net acres adjacent to our existing Northeast Eagle Ford leasehold in Lavaca County. While largely undeveloped the asset comes with cash flow from existing production as well as valuable midstream assets that are synergistic with our existing acreage. We expect to close on this transaction by the end of January.","The acquisition effectively cores up a high-return, 70-well development area with upside potential that has demonstrated strong well performance from modern completions. With a cash transaction price of $185 million and our demonstrated execution capability in the Eagle Ford, we are confident in our ability to drive a strong, full cycle return from this opportunity.","To summarize, this level of comprehensive delivery across all three elements of our framework requires a returns focus, a constancy of focus, financial commitment, differentiated execution, technical excellence and top industry talent, the same factors that make this approach sustainable into the future.","To close out my prepared remarks, I will provide a high-level preview of our 2020 plan, which remains a work in progress that will be shared in final form next February. Rest assured, our framework for success will not change. We will put corporate returns first. We will build on our track record of sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing. We will prioritize return of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and we will maintain our focus on differentiated execution across all aspects of our business.","Our focus as a company into 2020 is less E&P and more S&P. For almost two years now, we have delivered financial outcomes, corporate returns, free cash flow and organically funded return of capital that few E&Ps in our peer space have matched. And while we will continue to work hard to retain and build upon our competitive advantage versus direct E&P peers, we are just as focused on effectively competing with the broader market on a financial basis and doing so in a volatile commodity price environment.","To this end, our 2020 budget planning basis will remain at $50 per barrel WTI, although our enterprise free cash flow breakeven will be below that level despite the headwinds of NGL and gas pricing. Total and development capital spending will be down year-over-year in 2020. And as a result our U.S. oil growth is expected to moderate from the double-digit growth levels that have characterized the previous two years.","We will drive sustainable broad market competitive growth on both an annual and exit-to-exit basis in 2020 as well as into 2021 with the final growth level simply an outcome of our rigorous and disciplined capital allocation process that prioritizes corporate returns and free cash flow generation. The optimization and shape of the production profile is critically important to assure sustainability across both 2020 and 2021. And as such, we expect average-to-average and exit-to-exit growth rates to be comparable.","Our fourth quarter U.S. production guidance reflects our intentional transition to this more moderate growth trajectory that further enhances our free cash flow capacity in both 2020 and 2021. While our wells to sales will decline in the fourth quarter fully consistent with our initial plan, which always had 4Q marking the low point on quarterly wells to sales, we are running above the high end of the guidance range for wells to sales for the full year, have strong exit-to-exit U.S. oil growth and just raised our 2019 full year U.S. oil growth guidance by 100 basis points.","We are confident in the operational momentum and capital efficiency we are carrying into 2020, and most importantly, in our ability to deliver on all elements of our framework for success.","More specifically, relative to the U.S. resource play capital allocation split that has characterized our development program for the last couple of years approximately 60% to the Eagle Ford and Bakken and about 40% to Oklahoma and Northern Delaware, we will allocate a greater share of our development capital to our highest return assets the Eagle Ford and Bakken. This will drive oil production growth for both assets in 2020 supported by the tremendous resource base enhancement success we have realized in both plays that has only further enhanced capital allocation optionality across our multi-basin portfolio.","Finally, with a focus on establishing line of sight to outsized full cycle returns our REx program will transition from one heavily weighted toward acreage capture to one more focused on exploration, appraisal and delineation drilling in our new Texas Delaware oil play and in the Louisiana, Austin Chalk.","In summary, we are proud of the results we have delivered and we are excited about our outlook. While we are frustrated by market volatility and by our sector's equity performance, we believe in our strategy and our framework for success. Within that context, we will remain focused on what we control, which is our execution and the consistent delivery of compelling bottom line financial and operational outcomes quarter-after-quarter. In time, it is this superior financial performance that will ultimately be rewarded by the market.","Thank you all for listening. And with that I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And from JPMorgan, we have Arun Jayaram. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning, Lee. I wanted to maybe clarify\u2026","Lee Tillman","Good morning.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could maybe elaborate on your commentary regarding 2020 as well as the outlook comments you made on 2021. Is it -- did I understand this correctly that you anticipate MRO to deliver year-over-year U.S. oil growth in both years as well as on an exit-rate basis for both years? And does that contemplate lower spending than the $2.4 billion development CapEx budget that you had this year?","Lee Tillman","Yes. On your first part, Arun, absolutely, you've interpreted it correctly. We think it's -- first of all, it's vitally important that your starting point is from a position of driving returns and sustainable free cash flow generation. And to that end, we will optimize our production profile as an output of that. And we believe, it's very important from a sustainability standpoint to ensure that that profile holds true for not only average-to-average growth, but also for exit-to-exit growth particularly when you look across a kind of a multi-year time line.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just wanted to -- my follow-up is regarding how should we think about REx spending in 2020 and 2021, as you transition more from a leasehold capture mode into testing the concepts. And I was also wondering if you can maybe elaborate on the level of infrastructure that is in the Texas Delaware oil play that you highlighted last night?","Lee Tillman","Okay. Great. I'll take the -- maybe the REx spend question and maybe let Pat comment a little bit about the new Texas Delaware oil play including the infrastructure. On your first question, Arun, around the REx spin we do anticipate spend in 2020 and 2021 to be consistent with the kind of longer-term run rate guidance that we have provided in the past, which is the nominal $200 million mark.","We believe that we can continue even with this transition to more of an appraisal and exploration drilling program to live within that type of budget. And maybe with that I'll let Pat make a few comments about the new Texas Delaware oil play.","Pat Wagner","Sure. Good morning Arun. Just there is existing shallow production and ongoing development on these leases that is above the Woodford and the Meramec. In fact we have our gas production from these two wells already on pipe and we'll have all of our oil production on pipe by the end of the year. These are very large leases with favorable surface ownership and we don't anticipate any problems with development plenty of infrastructure. I'd also say we're only 20 miles from the Wink terminal, so we're very close to the markets and we feel really good about this.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And is the rig line that you anticipate Pat in the Texas Delaware oil play, is that going to be within REx or within the broader budget?","Pat Wagner","It will be within REx.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I would say Arun given the nature of the type of drilling, bear in mind that even though we have two very encouraging wells, one of them has about 100 days of production, the other about 150 days of production. We're still in the very early phases. And this is a very large acreage position, which is completely undeveloped. So we really still are in an exploration and appraisal mode even as we go into 2020. But we do have very good confidence though that we are seeing in these two wells the types of results that we were expecting.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Arun.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And with that from RBC Capital Markets, we have Scott Hanold.","Scott Hanold","Yeah, thanks. Just a little bit more on this new area in the Permian you all found. Can you give us a sense of how you built this concept? I mean, obviously, there are a lot of companies running around in the Permian Basin and this is not out on the beaten path. So what did you find differently than others are seeing? And how confident do you feel on success going forward?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Maybe I'll make a few general comments and then again I'll hand over to Pat to maybe talk a little bit specifically. I want to maybe remind everyone again just about the concept that is inherent in our REx activities. And I mentioned this in my remarks, this is really the pursuit of these low entry cost opportunities that have appropriate scale that we believe can generate truly outsized full cycle returns. It's a very different model. It's a very different organizational structure.","The talented members of this team are compensated a bit differently than the rest of the organization. So it's a very different approach that we have taken within the REx program. And, of course, in this case the Texas oil Delaware play is one that really we've been working since 2018. So it has been a work in progress. But maybe I'll let Pat share a little bit more about the journey and how we find ourselves where we are today.","Pat Wagner","Sure. Good morning, Scott. Lee kind of hit on the organizational structure and kind of the way we've set up this team, which I think has been very important in -- to the success.","The team has been very focused on looking for oil resource that has multiple targets and they've been very surgical in the way they look at that. There is this play that we have identified that we're revealing today that has Woodford, has Meramec and potentially other zones in between.","We initially leased 20,000 acres, drilled the two wells and we're very enthusiastic about the results. So then we quickly went out and grew the play to 60,000 acres. We feel like now we've captured the core of the position and we feel very good that it's set up well for development and we're ready to move into delineation and further appraisal.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And as my follow-up question on the new -- in the Eagle Ford on the new acreage do you plan on allocating some activity in 2020, 2021? And how much to that area?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. We'll get into more specifics on relative capital allocation. But you should assume Scott that this acreage will fold into the current optimization that we're doing across the enterprise right now to develop both our 2020 and 2021 execution level plans. And this will just be part of that broad enterprise optimization.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Thanks. Look forward to it.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Hi, good morning everybody. I wondered, if I could just pivot, Lee to the international just for a second and ask you if you could give us an update on how you see the longevity of EG at this point. I know I've touched on this before, but clearly a big part of your go-forward proposition is your significant free cash flow on a couple of your plays onshore, but also from EG. So where do we stand today in terms of any efforts you see to continue to enhance that following the Noble transaction for example and just how you see the longevity of that free cash flow? And I've got a follow-up please.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Yeah, thanks Doug. Yeah, first of all maybe just a statement just about, which of the assets are generating free cash flow. Although EG is certainly a low investment, a high free cash flow asset I want to make it very clear that we are getting strong free cash flow support from our U.S. portfolio as well, particularly obviously in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford.","With respect to EG specifically, I would -- I talk about EG in terms of there are two value propositions within EG. There is the Alba gas condensate field, which is on a -- it basically is a long life, low decline asset. And then there is the value associated with this unique and differentiated world-class infrastructure that we have there sitting on Bioko Island, which of course is a gas plant, methanol plant and LNG facility with storage and offloading. That is a very unique piece of kit.","We've already leveraged that to bring in the Alen volumes and we expect again those molecules to show up in the first half of 2021. But we also recognize that both locally and regionally this is a gas prone area and we are the natural aggregators of gas. We have a very well-run world-class facility here that does have allege that will come available. And we want to make sure that we place that asset in a position to compete for those other regional and local gas volumes. And that's a big element of that go-forward value proposition for Equatorial Guinea.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate your answer. And obviously, we'll continue to watch how that evolves. My follow-up is probably on the \u2013 predictably on the new play. I \u2013 it's maybe a little bit of an obtuse question but clearly you haven't really given us a lot of detail for the obvious reasons. But I'm wondering, if you can speak to how this stacks up pardon the pun relative to the existing Delaware position in terms of oil maturity in terms of acreage continuity and whether there is any thought to the future relative capital allocation whether this might jump above the existing Delaware position in the queue. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I think it's probably a bit premature right now to talk about relative capital allocation from a development capital standpoint. But certainly, Doug, we feel strong enough about the competitive nature \u2013 the potential competitive nature of this acreage by talking about a full rig line running there in 2020 with a view toward getting that play ready to compete for capital allocation in the development capital budget.","From a continuity and contiguous nature standpoint this is a very contiguous acreage position. As Pat already mentioned, we have large blocks. We also have 100% working interest today in the basin or in the acreage that we've acquired and so we believe this to be a very complementary asset to our already strong Northern Delaware position.","Doug Leggate","That's helpful. Thanks, Lee.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Brian Singer. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. When you think of the more S&P part of the going-forward strategy can you add some color on whether that means the first priority is free cash flow and how you broadly think about the desired ranges on more of a mid-cycle basis of free cash flow yield dividend yield and top line growth?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Certainly, from \u2013 when we talk about more S&P what we mean by that is returns first and sustainable free cash flow that is sustainable across a broad range of commodity price outcomes. We want to ensure that our model is robust at kind of the low end of the commodity price range and is competitive. But then we also want to make sure that the higher end if we do see price support that we can generate outsized full \u2013 basically free cash flow yields. We believe that presents an investment case that can gain traction because we're offering upside potential to offset some of the implicit volatility of the commodity. But the number one objective as we do our capital allocation and set our budget will be wrapped around corporate returns and generating that sustainable free cash flow yield.","Once, we obviously have that plan in place just as we've done for really almost now the last two years, we will then make prudent decisions about how best to share that free cash flow with our shareholders. We have a dividend today that is competitive with our E&P peers. And in fact, if you look at similarly sized S&P industrials it's also competitive. It's still a conversation that we have quarter in and quarter out, but today we still believe that a disciplined repurchase program in today's environment and based on where equities are trading today offers the best return to our shareholders. But those financial outcomes that we just went through Brian those are the objectives of our business plan. Again for us, volumes and production outcomes are just at their outputs from that process.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to bolt-on acquisitions other acquisitions and then the interplay between that and returning capital to shareholders. First, when we look at the opportunity here in the Eagle Ford $185 million, how available are additional opportunities throughout the portfolio that could add scale to your existing assets? And when you think about saving up \u2013 potentially saving up cash for inorganic opportunities acreage or not how does that influence your return of capital to shareholders?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I would say that, we're constantly scanning the market for opportunities. It's a challenge that we talked about the characteristics of the Eagle Ford bolt-on the fact that it was synergistic that it was returns-accretive that it essentially offered largely an undeveloped position with upside. Once you start putting that kind of filter on the full opportunity set whether that be Eagle Ford Bakken or anywhere else that really narrows the field. And so we have to be very disciplined about how we evaluate and ultimately how we might transact even on small bolt-ons like the one that we just announced. But I think once you start applying the criteria that playing field gets reduced very, very significantly. And so we're always in the market. We always want to be opportunistic. And the financial flexibility that we have created with our balance sheet strength is something that we get to lean on when those opportunities do in fact come up. That also allows us to pursue those opportunities in a way that's not mutually exclusive to continue to return free cash flow back to our shareholders. Again, our return of cash to shareholders is governed by our free cash flow generation, and we can leverage our balance sheet to take on some of these more opportunistic things in the marketplace.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","From SunTrust, we have Neal Dingmann. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, Lee and team. Lee real one quick question. I could not help but notice in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you did increase your activity on your two highest margin plays the Eagle Ford and Bakken. I'm just wondering, could you speak to how you see the returns on these especially compared to your Northern Delaware position? Again, we know how good that is so I was interested to hear your comments throwing out the Eagle Ford and Bakken potentially even better returns than this?","Lee Tillman","Yes. And I want to be really clear too that as we look ahead when we say increase, we mean increase on a relative basis. Again, the development capital program is coming down. It's the relative allocation that's going up. And it shouldn't be that surprising. Again, this is one of the advantages of the multi-basin portfolio. With really the dislocation of NGL and gas pricing right now that tends to drive you to your more oily assets. And so for us, that coupled with the fact that we have been so successful in the organic enhancement activities in both Eagle Ford and Bakken in this current pricing environment, it gives us the opportunity to lean on those a bit more.","We're still progressing activity in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware. Those returns and those more concentrated programs are still very competitive. But as you look at the near-term kind of pricing environment, there's no doubt that the Bakken and the Eagle Ford because of their oil weighting are superior from an economic return standpoint. I mentioned in my opening remarks that in some of the extension work that we did last year in the Bakken, even on actual pricing and actual costs, those wells pay out in 10 months. I mean, these are very impressive economic returns, but it all has to come to roost in your enterprise level return.","So we're going to design our program in such a way that it will ensure that we continue this underlying rate of change in our corporate level returns too. We don't want to get -- half-cycle returns are great as we do our internal relative capital allocation, but we're going to judge our investment program on how is it moving our enterprise level returns, certainly even on a price-normalized basis.","Neal Dingmann","Thanks for the clarification. And then looking at slide 14 maybe following up on the Bakken. You've all done a nice job of just continuing to expand that and extend that play physically down South. Could you talk as you sort of sit today, how you think about total core inventory and maybe where the focus is going to be for 2020 in that play?","Mitch Little","Yes. Sure Neal. This is Mitch. I think slide 14 that you're referencing there and the slide earlier in the deck where we really have highlighted organic enhancement helps characterize and gives you a good visual on how much we've extended the core. We certainly would say the majority of Hector and Ajax have been proven up through our organic enhancement trials. To put some context to that, if you look at Hector over the last two years, we've doubled well productivity while shaving 30% off of well costs. That's a game changer for economics in the Bakken.","And as Lee mentioned in his remarks, we've significantly upgraded the returns of hundreds of locations across both those basins to where the vast majority of our remaining inventory in both basins is top-tier. I also want to make it really clear the 500 adds that we talked about in the release, those are absolutely new sticks that weren't in our prior life of field plans of development. So we'll see a good mix of Hector and Myrmidon next year on the upgraded returns.","I don't have the exact split between those right now as we're still finalizing and tweaking the plans, but we'll certainly have activity in both areas. And we will continue our efforts across all these basins to drive further enhancements from the organic enhancement efforts that are targeting, not only well productivity, but also well cost. And we certainly see additional running room for future adds in both of those basins.","Neal Dingmann","Perfect. Thanks, Lee, thanks Mitch.","Operator","From Susquehanna, we have Biju Perincheril. Please go ahead.","Biju Perincheril","Hi, good morning. Lee going back to the relative allocation of capital next year. I suppose the success that you're seeing in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford is a direct function of your understanding of that -- of the rock there. And when we -- in the Northern Delaware looks like you have sort of a methodical delineation program. So can you give us some goals or milestones you're looking for in that delineation before you can -- either before that asset can come to a more -- a higher proportion of your CapEx?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I'll maybe say a few things and then also ask Mitch to chime in as well. You're right. We have been very methodical in our approach to Northern Delaware. You have multiple STACK plays across a very broad geographic area. We mentioned for instance in fourth quarter that we're actually moving over into the Red Hills area to continue our delineation there. So that work is really still ongoing. And in parallel with that delineation and appraisal work, we're also continuing to work on other aspects of the business in Northern Delaware to ensure that we're maximizing our margins. And that's everything from getting oil and water on pipe to ensuring that we have the absolute lowest lease operating expense there as well.","So we're doing all of the things that we need to do to be prepared, to take that asset into a more I would say aggressive growth mode that we get it to more of a scale in our portfolio. But we can be methodical. We can be patient. This is again the beauty of the multi-basin model. We don't have to get in front of our headlights. We can make sure that we truly are optimizing the field development plan. And that's what's going to be our focus and certainly, we have a lot of work left to do in that area in 2020.","Mitch Little","Yes, Biju I'll just add a little bit of additional color. I think Lee has covered the medium term outlook really well. Speaking specifically about 2019, about half of our activity was in the Malaga area in Eddy County and about half in Red Hills and we would characterize the Red Hills activity as more heavily weighted towards delineation.","You see across our more mature basins the type of productivity we're driving and those workflows translate to all basins we operate. And if I highlight the Upper Wolfcamp activities in Malaga where we've had enough activity in that area to move into development mode, you see similar kind of performance improvement there with 35% increase in productivity per lateral foot and 20% well cost reductions.","But this is a multi-bench play, lot of column to work with. I think we had tested six different intervals over the course of 2019 and we'll have more delineation as part of the program in 2020. So, there's an efficient pace at which to move forward on these. Some areas are moving into development and other areas we're still in delineation mode.","Biju Perincheril","That's very helpful. And my second question was in the new play in the Woodford. In the slide deck you showed two landing zones. Can you say if the first two wells tested those both of those zones? Or were they both in one zone?","Pat Wagner","This is Pat, Biju. We're not going to disclose exactly where we landed the existing wells, but both of those wells did test the Woodford.","Biju Perincheril","Understood. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Biju.","Operator","From Stifel we have Derrick Whitfield. Please go ahead.","Derrick Whitfield","Good morning all and thanks for taking my questions. Shifting back to the Bakken in Slide 13 specifically. You've done an exceptional job of taking capital costs out of the business and arguably have the lowest well cost in the basin. Could you comment on the drivers for the design savings and on whether or not you've tested or evaluated in-basin sand?","Mitch Little","Sure Derrick. This is Mitch again. Let me back up to kind of a high level and then I'll walk you through some of the specifics. I'm sure you can appreciate I'm probably not going to give you the full play-by-play of our success, but I can share the mindset and the approach we're taking and then I'll address your regional sand question.","What I would say is our corporate returns focus has really resonated well throughout the organization and deep into the organization. We started on this organic enhancement journey with a focus on well productivity which was really driven by high-intensity completions. But as we've evolved that approach, it's evolved to a relentless focus on not only well productivity, but well costs.","And so the way we attack that is we've evolved our proprietary workflows that -- we deployed targeted data acquisition. We integrate that with data analytics, advanced simulation techniques, and empirical results that really allow us to optimize from spud all the way through flow back.","We addressed well construction, reservoir targeting, pump schedule, cluster design, stage spacing, use of diverters, use of artificial lift; it's a very comprehensive list of things that we're attacking, and showing great improvement on.","Is there more room to grow or to go in the Bakken? We certainly believe so and our team certainly believes so. The last two quarters we've driven program completed well cost at new records. And in our Herbert pad which is the Southernmost Hector test to-date, we delivered $4.5 million completed well costs versus $4.9 million average for the Bakken.","We have looked at regional sand a number of times. We're not currently deploying it. We're always looking at alternative sourcing models. But we have seen some gains just in the contracting structures and strategies that have driven our proppant costs down in the Bakken as well.","Derrick Whitfield","Okay, that's very helpful and comprehensive. As my follow-up perhaps building on Doug's earlier question on the Texas-Delaware oil play could you comment on the pressure gradients for the Woodford and Meramec intervals and speak to the range of oil yields you're expecting across the trend?","Pat Wagner","Sure Derrick, this is Pat. I won't give you the exact pressure gradients but both the Meramec and the Woodford are over-pressured. I didn't catch the last part of your question.","Derrick Whitfield","Sure. The last part was just speak to the range of oil yields you're expecting across the trend.","Pat Wagner","Sure. Yes. It's about 65% average oil cut across the entire leaseholds.","Derrick Whitfield","Thanks guys. That's very helpful.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we have Nitin Kumar. Please go ahead.","Nitin Kumar","Good morning guys and thank you for taking my question. Maybe just going back to the 2020 and 2021 thought process. Could you quantify the maintenance CapEx that you're seeing for those years as you're bringing activity down and growth? I imagine that maintenance amount of spending is coming down, but if you could quantify that?","Dane Whitehead","Yes, we're not going to quantify maintenance capital. Obviously, we're still in the process of optimizing our business plan. We'll get more into the details of the plan in February. But suffice to say I think and Lee was talking about maintenance capital that even though we're setting our basis at $50 WTI, we expect the enterprise breakeven the point at which we're generating organic free cash flow to be below that in both of those years.","Nitin Kumar","Got it. And then just you mentioned the REx spending earlier about $200 million. What is the impact of Equinor? Like should we be thinking about the $200 million as a net Marathon number.","Nitin Kumar","Great. Thank you, so much.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Jeanine Wai. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Hi good morning everyone. Thanks for fitting me in here.","Lee Tillman","Good morning Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai","My question is on 2020. So, in terms of your decision to spend less year-over-year and lower the U.S. oil growth rate, do you have any kind of ballpark estimate on how much this enhances your either free cash flow capital efficiency or corporate breakeven relative to what your initial plan was which I think called for an increase in development activity next year?","Lee Tillman","Yes. First of all Jeanine, I would say, our objective was not to spend less. Our objective was in fact to enhance returns and drive free cash flow generation. And that model is what is as an output is generating a more moderate growth profile in 2020 and 2021. We're going to provide much more details more aligned with the last part of your question Jeanine as we get out into February.","Similar to this year's plan we expect to quantify the plan not only in terms of operational outcomes but also in terms of financial delivery as well based on our $50 planning basis. So I would just say stay tuned on that. But obviously we believe, that the optimized plan will strike the correct balance here between returns free cash flow generation while also achieving a more moderate oil growth rate here in the U.S.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks a lot. I look forward to February. And my follow-up is on the organic inventory expansion. You've made really good progress on that with the over 500 locations added in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. Can you provide a little bit more color on this? So for example are the additions more heavily weighted in one play versus the other? I know from the slide it looks like it could be pretty even. And how much of the additions are related to 2019 improvement? And lastly what is your economic cutoff for moving locations into this bucket?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I would say that your assessment is correct and that probably the split is generally pretty even maybe a little bit biased toward Eagle Ford. Again we talked about replacing a couple of years of inventory at current run rates. Obviously the run rate in Eagle Ford is a bit higher than the Bakken so you could kind of pro rata that to probably back into what that split is. We still obviously believe that there's a lot of remaining running room to chase there. I believe that the teams have done a good job. We believe it's a sustainable process as we look ahead and as we do with all three elements of the inventory enhancement framework.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","And from Raymond James, we have Pavel Molchanov. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. To EG, it's obviously going to be a similar portion last year [Technical Difficulty] relatively speaking. So can you talk about the [Technical Difficulty] that you're planning at the LNG facility in 2020?","Lee Tillman","We lost a good part of that Pavel. You're really breaking up. I know the question pertained to EG, but ex that it was very difficult to hear your question.","Pavel Molchanov","Yes. I was asking if, in 2020 any significant [Technical Difficulty] or maintenance cycles in EG?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Got you. That's much better Pavel. Thank you. I'll turn over to Mitch for that.","Mitch Little","Yes. Sure Pavel. Again, we'll disclose more specifics in February when we release our capital budget. But there are some maintenance activities at a couple of the onshore facilities in 2020.","Lee Tillman","And we'll give a bit more disclosure on that in February, so that it can be rolled in to everyone's modeling for the EG asset.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And as your balance sheet continues to kind of delever, what's your latest thinking just broadly skiing on hedging?","Dane Whitehead","Yes. This is Dane. Thanks for asking a question. I can answer. Right now, for the balance of this year, we're about 40% hedged on oil with three-way structures with about a $56 floor and ceiling I call north of $70. About half of that volume as we head into 2020 is currently hedged with three ways at like $55 to $65. We have a great balance sheet, very low breakeven price, so lots of financial flexibility. So we think of hedging in that context and are very patient not to rush into a flattish to macro-dated curve and add positions. We've been pretty opportunistic as we leg into it and expect us to continue to do that, just be very patient, but mindful that it's nice to have some downside protection as we move through '20 and into '21.","Pavel Molchanov","All right. Appreciate guys.","Dane Whitehead","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now turn it back to Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee Tillman","All right. Well, we recognize that investors have choices and we appreciate your interest in Marathon Oil. Execution excellence leads the way in our company. And again I want to personally thank all of our dedicated employees and contractors who deliver on that mandate 24\/7 quarter in and quarter out. Thank you very much and that concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman, President and CEO and Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Slide two contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and subsequent forms 10-Q and 8-K cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Please note in the appendix to this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2011 and 2012 first quarter and full year 2013 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.","We\u2019ll now move to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Clarence Cazalot to review 2012 operational results.","Clarence Cazalot","Thank you, Howard and good afternoon. 2012 was a very successful year for Marathon, characterized by strong operating results that met and in several cases exceeded our targets. As shown on slide three since the beginning of 2010, our quarterly E&T production available for sale has grown approximately 32%. This growth excludes Libya because of the civil unrest there in 2011. You\u2019ll specially note the growth over the past two quarters which was driven by our lower 48 onshore production.","Slide four demonstrates the more than doubling of our lower 48 onshore production from the third quarter 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012. The 2012 third to fourth quarter growth alone was 17%. Importantly, liquids volumes increased from 55% to 70% of total volumes from the third quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012 with a preference to oil and condensate. We estimate reaching between 165,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter 2013 and we\u2019ve again set a forward target with fourth quarter production expected to be between a 185,000 and 205,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Slide five shows that our liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes for E&P and oil sands mining excluding Libya increased 6% from 297,000 barrels per day in the third quarter to 313,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Again, this increase was driven by the U.S. resource plays, particularly the Eagle Ford as well as higher sales volumes in the UK offset by lower EG volumes. You will note that U.S. sales volumes have increased from 37% of the total in the third quarter of 2012 to 42% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Slide six shows the same comparison for actual fourth quarter 2012 to estimated first quarter 2013 sales volumes and the U.S. sales volumes are expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the total. You\u2019ll also note that we expect to take our first listings from Angola in the first quarter.","Slide seven shows our international E&P cost structure per BOE by category over the past eight quarters. Our operated international production in Norway, Equatorial Guinea and the UK have maintained excellent reliability and this effort is not only reflected in our production levels, but also in maintaining our cost structure over the last two quarters.","Slide eight, which excludes Libya, shows that as we enter 2013, we anticipate increases to the international cost structure. This is a combination of the projected decline in our Norway production as I just mentioned the start of production from the non-operated Angola block 31 PSVM development.","While we\u2019re seeing some increase here, I would point out that our overall international cost per BOE are still quite low.","As shown on slide nine, total U.S. E&P cost per BOE increased quarter-over-quarter primarily because of higher DD&A rates in the growing Eagle Ford and higher exploration expenses in the Gulf of Mexico.","Slide 10 compares the actual 2012 and estimated 2013 operating cost per BOE per U.S. E&P in the Eagle Ford. Importantly, you will note that our cash cost field level controllable and other are decreasing on a BOE basis reflecting our growing domestic production.","However, U.S. TD&A levels are increasing on a per BOE basis, largely as a result of a higher DD&A rate for Eagle Ford barrels, which are increasing from about 18% of our U.S. production in 2012 to about 40% in 2013.","In the Eagle Ford, as in most developing growth place, DD&A rates in the early years were higher, because initial reserve bookings do not reflect full life EURs and these rates come down as performance justifies additional reserve bookings.","Moving to slide 11, I\u2019ll take just a moment to comment on our execution in our three key resource place. Beginning with Eagle Ford where we have 230,000 net acres in the core part of that play. As you know, we exited 2012 with over 65,000 net BOE per day, which is in line with what we had committed and we\u2019ve averaged 70,000 BOE per day in January.","We\u2019ve increased our 2013 target from 70,000 net BOE per day to 85,000 net BOE per day. We\u2019re currently running 18 rigs and five frac crews in the Eagle Ford, and we continue to improve our spud-to-spud times an averaged 19 days in January.","We\u2019ll continue to see those spud-to-spud times decline particularly as we execute about 70% of our drilling in the Eagle Ford in 2013 on multi-well pads. We believe this may allow us to decrease ultimately to 16 rigs and still drill to roughly 290 plus wells that we planned for 2013. And we have our nine pilots underway and as we\u2019ve said previously we\u2019ll be commenting on the results of those pilots and certainly the impacts on our forward plans in the second half of the year.","As we turn to the Bakken where we have 410,000 net acres that we\u2019re currently producing about 33,000 net BOE per day. We have five rigs and two frac crews active and we\u2019ll drill 65 to 70 net wells in 2013. Importantly, you\u2019ll recall that we increased our 2013 target from about 30,000 net BOE per day to 33,000 and now with the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter and in January. We\u2019re looking to increase our target for 2013 to greater than 35,000 net BOE per day.","And turning to Oklahoma, our resource basins there, where we have about 220,000 net acres, we are currently producing about 12,000 net BOE per day from the Anadarko Woodford. We have two rigs operating in the Knox area of the Woodford and we will have those two rigs active throughout 2013. And as we have discussed before we have a very significant resource base that will act upon in this areas we see improvement in both NGO and natural gas prices.","And with that I will turn it back to Howard for the financial remarks.","Howard Thill","Thanks Clarence. Slide 12 provides an analysis of 2012 cash flows. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $4.5 billion, compared to $4.9 in 2011. Working capital changes resulted in a $437 million use of cash in an operating cash flow of $4 billion for 2012 compared to $5.4 billion in 2011. The decrease in operating cash flow year-over-year was primarily the result of working capital changes related to the 2012 ramp up of operations in the Eagle Ford Shale in Libya, and the timing of the tax payments.","I won\u2019t step through each of the other cash flow items, but this point out we ended the year with $684 million in cash total debt of $6.9 billion and a net debt to total capital ratio of 25%, the same as at the end of the third quarter.","Moving to slide 13, our fourth quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $398 million for the 15% decrease over the third quarter of 2012. Our international E&P fourth quarter pre-tax earnings increased $119 million, while Oil Sands mining, U.S. E&P and integrated gas saw offsetting decreases, because of the higher percentage of international pre-tax earnings, we also saw an increase in income taxes.","As shown on slide 14, the E&P segment\u2019s fourth quarter earnings increased slightly to $501 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and higher natural gas realizations, mostly offset by higher DD&A and operating costs associated with those additional volumes and higher exploration expenses.","Slide 15 shows the changes driving our fourth quarter U.S. E&P earnings. Large volume increases in the Eagle Ford and Bakken were partially offset by higher DD&A, operating costs and production taxes attributable to the new wells brought to sales. The increased exploration expense was associated with the unsuccessful Innsbruck well in the Gulf of Mexico.","Slide 16 shows the impact on international E&P earnings from the higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, price realization, and lower DD&A, partially offset by higher other costs and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we over-lifted in Libya, which has a favorable DD&A rate per BOE compared to the volumes we lifted in the third quarter, but it\u2019s also reflected in the higher income taxes shown on the slide.","As shown on slide 17, quarter-over-quarter, our E&P segment production available for sale was essentially flat, while our U.S. resource plays continued to ramp up significantly. There was an offsetting decrease quarter-over-quarter in Libya. As you may recall, we signed a gas sales contracts during the third quarter in Libya and recorded all previous volumes available for sale in that quarter. Excluding Libya, our production available for sale increased 7% quarter-over-quarter. Sales volumes increased approximately 8% as a result of over-lifting volumes in Libya and in the UK.","At the end of the fourth quarter, we were underlifted by approximately $4.7 million BOE of which approximately 4.1 million BOE was natural gas, 2.4 million in Libya and 1.7 million in Alaska gas storage.","On the liquid side, we were underlifted, 160,000 barrels in Angola, where we had first production from our PSPM development in block 31 during the fourth quarter as Clarence","previously mentioned. We were also underlifted 180,000 barrels in Europe, 145,000 barrels in EG and 100,000 barrels in Libya. During the fourth quarter, we significantly reduced our liquids underlift in Libya by a 1.9 million barrel overlift in the fourth quarter.","Slide 18 shows our Oil Sands mining segment income decreased $46 million sequentially. This was the result of unplanned downtime at the upgrader in the fourth quarter 2012 resulting in lower production volumes and lower price realizations. Net synthetic crude oil sales decreased 9% from 53,000 barrels per day in the third quarter to 48,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter","Moving to slide 19, integrated gas segment income decreased $4 million quarter over quarter to $35 million. This was primarily a result of lower LNG sales volumes with 14 liftings in the fourth quarter compared to 16 in the third quarter. Higher methanol sales partially offset the lower LNG income.","We will now move to slide 20 and I\u2019ll turn the call back to Clarence.","Clarence Cazalot","Thank you, Howard. Further to Howard\u2019s explanation of cash flows, I want to reiterate our commitment to living within our cash flows, while we grow our net production at a compound average rate of 5% to 7% from 2010 through 2017.","In 2013 alone we promise growth of 6% to 8%, excluding Libya and asset divestures. And as some of you have noted already, our production guidance for 2013 puts that range at 6% to 13%. That represents a stretched target and I\u2019ll simply reiterate our commitment is 6% to 8% growth and this is backed up by drilling inventory that we have great confidence in as I discussed earlier.","Moving to slide 21, the strong growth profile is underpinned by growing reserve base. About this time last year, we promised greater than 150% reserve replacement for 2012. And I\u2019m very pleased that our team has exceeded that expectation, delivering 185% reserve replacement, excluding acquisitions and divestitures at preliminary F&D cost estimated to be $17 per BOE, including acquisitions, which strengthened our Eagle Ford position.","We replaced 226% of our 2012 production again at an F&D projected to be approximately $17 per BOE. Over three year period, which we\u2019ve stressed as a more representative measure, our average reserve replacement has been 173% and we\u2019ve done this at a preliminary F&D rate of $23 per BOE. This has led to the highest level of proved reserve for Marathon Oil in 40 years and we\u2019re not finished. We have a portfolio that includes significant untapped resource, and through continued execution of our strategy, we plan to continue growing significant shareholder value.","Slide 22 summarizes many of the points I\u2019ve just made. So I\u2019ll just touch on a couple of additional key priorities for 2013. First is drilling a high graded exploration program that we believe provides significant upside to our shareholders. Second, our drive to continue to enhance our value through portfolio management and an increased focus on enhancing margins and overall cost competitiveness.","And with that, we will open the call to questions.","Howard Thill","To accommodate all of those who want to ask questions we ask you to limit yourself to two questions. And you can re-prompt for additional questions if time permits. Christine with that, I\u2019ll turn it over you to get people in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. I understand the operating cost guidance Clarence, thanks for that. But I guess my question is really on the as you shift your production goals towards the U.S. can you help us understand what the cash tax impact is in terms of how we should think about the deferred tax is going forward and I have a follow-up, please.","Clarence Cazalot","Let me let Doug, I have Janet touch on that.","Janet Clark","Yeah, I think because of our very high capital program in the U.S. the domestic spending is such that we would not expect to see cash taxes paid in the U.S. in the coming year. As you know our international taxes are largely all cash, and in fact deferred tax is reversing on and is incremental cash.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. The reason I asked the question, Clarence, if I may based on your current capital program based on given your production outlook it seems to us you are going to be throwing off a fair amount of cash, and update perhaps possibly on how your sales process in Canada is going as well. But when you take that together, it looks like you\u2019re going have a fair amount of cash this year. I am just curious as to what\u2019s your priority for using that cash and I\u2019ll leave you there? Thanks.","Clarence Cazalot","Well, Doug, I guess first of all, I would say that the amount of cash we drove off obviously is going to be dependent upon the commodity price environment that we face. But there is no question that certainly the growth in our U.S. production is going to drive strong cash flows from those resource plays, but at the same time you would recognize we are seeing declines in some of our legacy assets that have also been historically very strong cash flow providers like Norway. As you know, we will see about a 20,000 BOE a day decline in Norway this year from about 90,000 BOE a day to 70,000 BOE a day, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. So again obviously we do expect to continue to grow. Our cash flows, both on an absolute and a per-share basis, but I think you just have to look at all of the elements that come to bear on that.","With respect to, you mentioned Canada I would simply say that as you know and many others know, we did indicate that there had been discussions around the potential sale of a portion of our interest there. And I think what I would say to everyone is when and if that is no longer relevant or correct, we will say something. So you\u2019ll hear something either way, either in terms that we have come to a mutually acceptable transaction at some point in time or indeed \u2013 if indeed those discussions should breakdown, we would still advice of that as well.","The other sales, again, we \u2013 outside of Canada, we have said $1.5 billion to $3 billion of transactions between 2011 and the end of 2013, we continue to make progress on that and you\u2019d have noted in our earnings release today that we did announce the sale of our 34% interest in Neptune gas plant for $170 million. So we continue to make progress towards our overall goal by the end of this year.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","To really kind of get to the use of cash clearance as opposed to the sources of cash. I guess you get the punch line, are you happy with the portfolio or do you feel you have enough debts or should we expect additions of portfolio as we go forward?","Janet Clark","No, I think coming back, Doug, we have said first of all we\u2019re going to spend within our cash flows and certainly the $5.2 billion CapEx program we\u2019ve outlined for 2013, we think it fits with that. It is straight down the fairway of the guidance we\u2019ve given of $5 billion to $5.5 billion of spending going forward. With respect to additional cash that may come in from asset sales, certainly we\u2019ll look at that, I think we\u2019ve indicated in the past that for the most part, we believe that the bolt-on acquisition programs that we\u2019ve been doing, particularly in the Eagle Ford, have largely reached their end.","We believe, we\u2019re pretty much with may be one exception exhausted that opportunity set. Having spent quite a bit on acquiring and building the resource base we have, we will now set about to spend our money developing that and additional cash we would look to either as we said potentially a share buyback, strengthening our balance sheet and increasing the dividend, and no one should read into that necessarily, that\u2019s a priority. We\u2019ll assess that at the time, but clearly returning value back to our shareholders is a key driver for us and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019d look to do at that time.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. You outperformed again in the Eagle Ford. Could you talk a little bit more about how far \u2013 where do you want to driving that performance and particularly we\u2019re looking at the drilling days is exceeded our expectations in terms of how low you\u2019re going. How much further can you go with that plant. Could you talk a little bit more about how much pad drilling you\u2019re doing \u2013 just fill us more on just what\u2019s driving your success there?","Clarence Cazalot","Well, it\u2019s really easy answer, Paul. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s extraordinary people \u2013 the team we have is doing an outstanding job across the company. But, certainly in the Eagle Ford as we drill that may wells and continued to incrementally improve what we do, it all cumulatively adds up to very significant savings in spud-to-spud times. And of course, as I indicated in my remarks, we\u2019ll be aided in that in 2013 by the fact that we\u2019re moving to about 70% of our wells being drilled on multi well pads versus very few pad wells in 2012.","And as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, pad drilling significantly accelerates the spud-to-spud times and it\u2019s not necessarily representative of everything we\u2019ve been able to do, but we\u2019ve had occasions where three wells of one pad took us a total of 39 days, so roughly 13 days a well. So again, as you see more pad drilling, we\u2019re going to bring that \u2013 that the average in January of 19 down to a much lower level.","And so, as we\u2019ve talked about driving down our overall cost in the Eagle Ford, it\u2019s a combination of savings on rig time as well as savings that we\u2019re realizing in our completion cost that\u2019s allowing us to drive our overall drilling and completion cost down below the $8 million level that we\u2019ve talked about. So, I think it\u2019s all of those factors quite frankly Paul, that continue to enhance our overall performance.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks. And I know you\u2019ll encourage only one follow-up. So, if I could jump across on the subject to people, there was an abrupt resignation in the past quarter that surprised us Clarence, what is your public statements on what happened there? Thank you.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah. Paul, and look I know it came as a surprise and I know what you\u2019re referring to is Dave\u2019s resignation for the company, and I think as the release said it was to pursue other interest and obviously we wish Dave well and whatever he elect to pursue. The message I would have for investors is that we have a very strong team here at Marathon. As I was just talking about the results in the Eagle Ford, we could say the same across the rest of our business. We have a very talented, experienced leadership team and I believe the company is in the very, very good hands, and I would simply say that the development of our leadership team, of our executives and succession plans are at a very high priority at Marathon for the management team and for the board as well. And so, again I would reinsure investors that the company is in very good hands.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks, Clarence. If I could just confirm that Marathon has a mandatory 65-year-old retirement age, which without wanting to embarrass you, I think is going to fairly shortly affect you?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, actually, I\u2019m 62, Paul, but I feel 52 on some days. But to your point and it\u2019s what I was referring to just a moment ago, succession planning is a critical priority in this company and it is something that particularly with respect to CEO succession and the board spends a great deal of time and effort on. And I again will assure you is as all the shareholders that when it\u2019s time for me to step aside, this company will be in very good hands and will be able to led into the future. So, again I would simply say there is nothing for investors to worry about at that point.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much in deed sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. The question on Eagle Ford I think you guys plan to drill 275 to 320 operated wells. I know you bringing as much sales as you drill in 2012, which is as expected, but how should we think about the backlog for 2013, kind of building falling same ratios as it affect production. And then secondly I appreciate your color in increase pad drilling, can you update me kind of where you on oil cost today versus your 2013 target. Thanks.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, I think Evan I\u2019m not exactly sure, which backlog you\u2019re talking about. We and you cited the range we\u2019ve given. I think the most specific number is about 290 to 295 wells that we plan to drill this year and we\u2019ve talked about the fact that while we\u2019re at 18 rigs currently, we may able to go to 16 rigs and still achieve that program. Again, we feel pretty confident about that. We\u2019ve been asked, why don\u2019t you keep those 18 rigs and drill more wells and I think it goes exactly to your question. We are drilling at a pace and growing our production at a pace that aligns with the midstream development and the takeaway capacity.","So we avoid just that kind of backlog that you\u2019re talking about, and continue to be able to hookup our wells with in a very short time of when we got them fracked, so that we don\u2019t have a great deal of production shut in. It has helped a great deal as you know that we have invested significantly in the midstream, last year was around $350 million, this year it\u2019s about $190 million at central batteries and gathering lines that has allowed us to move off of trucks with about 60% of our barrels now on pipe that gives us again greater optionality and lowers our costs. There obviously is a CSR advantage as well in the region in terms of traffic. And we intend to move that closer to 70% by the end of the year. So continue to move our barrels on pipe.","So I would simply say, we don\u2019t have a significant backlog, we typically try to keep in terms of our fracs, about 25 wells that are out and front, so we never have our frac crews waiting on a drilling break. So if that was what you were concerned about the frontend, we\u2019ve got inventory built there and then on the backend, in terms of keeping our barrels moving, we\u2019re in good shape there.","Again I would say in terms of the overall drilling and completion costs, we\u2019ve been running about $8.5 million, we will take that down as I said just a moment ago to just below $8 million drilling completion, and then we\u2019ll have some additional facilities cost on that that will bring that up for about $8.1 million. I would simply indicate that as we look at our opportunities, keep driving cost down in the Eagle Ford. We do indeed see some opportunity particularly on the stimulation side, the frac cost side to continue to driving \u2013 drive some of our cost down there on the drilling rig side. The greatest savings is going from 18 rigs to 16 rigs and being able to drill the same number of wells. So that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting our cost.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s very helpful. Second question just on corporate expenses, they were up from 3Q, and maybe I missed it, I don\u2019t know if there were any kind of a onetime charges in there. Should we expect this to revert lower in 2013 and closer to 3Q or any guidance would be helpful? Thanks.","Janet Clark","Sure, I think if you look at allocated G&A was up from 83 and 134 and interest expense was up from 53 to 61 quarter-over-quarter. And there is about $25 million of comps and comps related expenses that are really of an unusual nature, and we not expect to see them recurring. We had about actually $10 million of IT expense in the quarter. Our IT spend did not exceed our budget, our plan for the year, but it was very much backend weighted. And so that\u2019s not a run rate that you should expect to see continuing.","In addition we have a tax sharing agreement with MPC and relatively small amount quarter in and quarter out, over time they will be income neutral. But in the fourth quarter showing up in that unallocated G&A was about at a $11 million expense associated with the MPC, tax sharing agreement which will be offset, again that will be income neutral. So, don\u2019t think of that is recurring either. When you look at interest expense quarter-over-quarter, it was up about $8 million and as you know, we issued the debt $2 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and while it was a very, very attractive interest rate. It felt was more expensive than the CP that is replaced. So, interest expenses going to be up marginally quarter over, that will be ongoing.","And then as always a little bit of noise in the G&A and interest numbers, a lots of other miscellaneous things. But I think that if you look at the third quarter and allocated G&A, it is probably closer to a reasonable run arte. Although with ramp up in activity levels, we\u2019re going to see some natural inflation in there, but I think Clarence eluded to the fact we are looking at ways that we can more efficiently operate so that we can produce greater value for the shareholders.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Clarence, just a couple international questions. I think you mentioned in the release the Kurdistan, Declaration of Commerciality. Could you just talk about next steps there? What kind of capital order of magnitude, we may be looking at. And then just on the Gabon subsalt well that I think spuds later this quarter. Is that one where the state of the block is depending on this first well or their multiple prospects? Thank you.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah. I guess, Arjun, I don\u2019t recall making a comment on Declaration of Commerciality in Kurdistan. We have had the very successful second well drilled at Atrush.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah.","Clarence Cazalot","And perhaps, may be\u2026","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I apologize, it\u2019s been filed, I think according to your release.","Clarence Cazalot","Okay.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So, maybe, nothing to clear, apologies.","Clarence Cazalot","Okay. And of course, earlier this week, I think one of the partners in that projects disclosed some independent reserve reports that they had done on the asset. But at this point, obviously we\u2019ll continue to participate there. We\u2019re very anxious to see the commerciality of how these barrels will be brought to market given some of the difficulties that are ongoing there today, particularly because the relationships between Bagdad and Rubiel.","In terms of our spending there this year, it\u2019s the Harir well that we\u2019ve indicated that first well was a dry hole. We have two wells drilling today on the Mangesh and Gara wells that are on the Sarsang block, and we\u2019ll have another well, the Mawawa well drilled later this year. And then, we\u2019ll be following up with two of our operated wells, one at Safen and one at Mawawa, which is on the same block as Harir well. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve given necessarily the full investment there, I would simply say that we have formed down, as you know, 35% interest in our two operated blocks origin and we have mitigated further I would simply say our financial exposure to the drilling. And so, we\u2019re going to get a very cost efficient evaluation of these prospects in 2013.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Then just on the Gabon presalt and one done or some more prospects there?","Clarence Cazalot","Well, I\u2019m a former exploration partner, so you never want to say when done, it is going to be a great important test because it is on a very large structure. These structures all defined by 3D seismic, there is a question mark of course is the presence of reservoir, the quality of the reservoir out there in the deep water as well as the access to source, we see the salt seal above these structures. So I\u2019d never say that one well in that larger block can completely make or break the block, but it\u2019s going to have a very significant impact certainly in our view of it. And so it\u2019s a promising well, and we look forward to it and I think the spud was originally mid-February and now it looks like it\u2019s going to slip into March, so we watch that with great anticipation.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great, Thank you so much.","Howard Thill","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Hi, thanks for taking my question. You guys touched on this briefly earlier, but I was hoping you could comment on recent North Sea production trends, but I believe about a year ago, you were expecting a 2012 production at Alpine to average about 80 a day. And it looks like it actually came in around 90. So you\u2019ve outperformed there, can you just talk about what all you\u2019ve done to improve the production there and may be give us your latest thoughts on extending that plateau and what declines could look like in 2013, 2014. So do you see some upside to that 70,000 barrels a day in 2013 that you mentioned earlier in light of some of the recent performance.","Clarence Cazalot","I wish I could answer that affirmatively, but I would say that the extraordinary work that our team has done in the past not just in raising 2012 production about what we said, but if you look back historically at what our 2008, 2009 plans said, we have really outperformed for several years here. And to your point extended the plateau and raised the plateau to a higher level of 90,000 barrels a day, in 2012 and that was a combination of additional tie-backs to Alpine, but again pretty extraordinary reservoir work and operating reliability on that asset and that\u2019s allowed us to achieve some really top quartile performance.","There is no getting away from the decline we see in the 2013. It is about a 20,000 barrel a day decline to average around the 70,000 BOE per day. We continue to advance projects like \u2013 that we\u2019ll be able to tie back to Alpine and that will help flatten the decline in the future when that project comes on I believe at the end of the 2014, but the decline will still be there. We certainly continue to look for new opportunities to tie back within the acceptable radius, but I think we\u2019ve pretty much exhausted that opportunity set. We will continue to operate the asset on \u2013 as lower costs and reliable basis as we can, because as I\u2019ve said before despite the fact that Norway is a high tax rate country, these barrels get a very premium price, obviously the lower prices and at low cost. So, it is a \u2013 still a strong margin, highly profitable though.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay. Great. And then also you raised the Bakken guidance, but one could argue that it\u2019s still conservative in light of some of the recent performance. So my question is how conservative Mike that guidance be and what type of activity levels does it imply for you all through year? Sorry if I missed that earlier. And also, what might cause you to accelerate activity there, certainly realizations have improved, prices have been strong, I assume you\u2019ve gotten some service cost release, just wanting to get a sense of what you might need to see get more active there?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, I think, first of all with the guidance or the activity levels, it will remain at five rigs. This year we do have two frac crews active. We may indeed be able to scale that back to one frac crew and that is to drill about 65 operated wells and to your point on the guidance, I\u2019ve recognized that in the fourth quarter we \u2013 we hit an essence what is our \u2013 was our guidance for \u2013 higher than our guidance for 2013. So, we\u2019re certainly simply looking at that. But I would tell you that we have to be careful because it is winter time up there. You\u2019ve noted that our January production is below, where we were in the fourth quarter and weather can have a very significant impact on that. But again our team continues to perform extremely well.","What we look at additional activity, we will. And to your point that we\u2019ve seen improvements in Bakken pricing as rail has opened up additional outlets eliminating some of the bottlenecks. We too have increased our use of rail. If you go back to January of 2012, we only railed about 5% of our barrels. Now, we\u2019re up to 40%. We\u2019ll continue to look at that as a good opportunity certainly in 2013 when we think the differentials will support that kind of activity. But we don\u2019t want to lock into long-term activity until we get a better sense of how overall infrastructure and builds out and differentials are impacted. So, we certainly will look at that possibility of ramping up if we see the right conditions.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Folks, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on divestitures maybe two specific assets if I could. One the Marcellus was noticeably absent from commentary. I was just curious if you\u2019re planning to move forward there or potentially exit? And I guess the similar question on Libya, obviously the production is ramp back pretty aggressively here. I\u2019ve read recent press report that suggests there could be upside production potential in the area which could potentially garner some interest from some of your larger peers. And I am just curious if that could potentially be an asset you would look to divest and help maybe neutralize this erratic tax rate that we\u2019ve been seeing? Thanks.","Janet Clark","Yes, Blake, I guess on the first piece, it is our intent if we are able to secure the right value to exit the Marcellus I think we\u2019ve been pretty well upfront about the fact that is not an area that is quarter less and so that certainly is something we\u2019re looking at.","With respect to Libya as sale candidate, as I have said before, Blake, we don\u2019t comment on specific assets that we haven\u2019t announced for sale, simply because we believe that weakens our hand if indeed we ever do elect to monetize an asset. And so at this point I simply would say you\u2019re right that this asset has great upside. We\u2019ve said in the past and most recently the NOC has said in the past that it\u2019s an asset capable of producing upwards of 600,000 barrels a day from the current 320,000. The key to realizing that is going to be to develop some major projects that have already been discovered and we\u2019re in the planning process. So we see strong value in this asset going forward despite its high tax rate.","And I recognize it has a high tax rate, but the nature of that contract is that no matter what the oil price is, Libya will always generate positive earnings and as well as likely positive cash. It is a very favorable contract in that regard and it\u2019s a high return asset. So, we will continue to move forward with it.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, great. My second question Clarence if you don\u2019t mind just addressing quickly the another discussion of potential MLP in the Eagle Ford with regard to the midstream takeaway capacity I didn\u2019t know if you had any updates there on where you stood?","Clarence Cazalot","No, it\u2019s really way to early at this point Blake for us to begin exploring that. I think we certainly see that as a possibility in the future, when we finally reach a stage that we have built out the infrastructure and are convinced that we are able to capture the value of our production, which is the highest priority here.","We do need to maintain control over that infrastructure to move our barrels to where we see the best value, but we still got more work to do there. And as you heard me say before we are going to have to determine ultimately what is the plateau level of production if we want to get to in the Eagle Ford. As I have said before we are not going to run to a peak and then decline.","We want to reach the plateau that we can maintain for several years, so we can build out the infrastructure to meet those needs and not end up with over capacity very shortly after reaching a peak production. So, I think for now we are going to continue to move forward building out what we need. I want to all set and done. We got some operating history in that asset. We can look at whether or not at MLP allows us to capture incremental value from it, but that\u2019s not a near-term priority.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, this is Scott Willis on for Ed. I sort of quick one on the Eagle Ford, so I mean it looks like your production is ramping pretty nicely and the proved well economics are attractive as well. I was just wondering what your expectation is for when Eagle Ford may begin to contribute to the free cash flow of Marathon as a whole and I just have one follow up.","Janet Clark","Yeah, we\u2019ve said consistently I think and the time we did the Hilcorp acquisition that we saw the Eagle Ford turning cash flow positive in 2014 and that is still the case.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then just on the Eagle Ford infrastructure, it looks like you\u2019re spending about $190 million this year. I was just wondering, how you\u2019re spending may look going forward in relation to that over the next few years.","Janet Clark","Yeah, I think this year is going to be about a half where we were last year, a little more than that and I think we would expect 2014 to be half again at that point and I probably don\u2019t want to comment much beyond that in part that\u2019s going to determine at what level again do we want to focus in on a plateau type of production that we would build out to.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then just last one on the Bakken well, do you have a pre-drill or resource expectation there.","Janet Clark","I believe we did have that in our presentation and I want to say, it\u2019s we\u2019ve said 250 million to 800 million barrels of growth resource potential above range.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Janet, I just wanted to follow up with the earlier question, I just want to make sure I understood. On the deferred tax as a company as a whole, not just in the U.S. as a company as a whole, should we assume that in this year as we turn into a positive cash flow item.","Janet Clark","Next year, yeah, and well \u2013 yeah, this year 2013, yes.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Right.","Clarence Cazalot","Already turning to a positive cash flow item.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And Clarence, it\u2019d great that you provide some data on Eagle Ford on the unit cost structure. Do you have a similar data that you may be able to share on Bakken?","Clarence Cazalot","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to show that. The Bakken has grown at a more modest and measured pace, and it has not had the kind of impact on our overall U.S. aggregation that we\u2019ve seen in Eagle Ford. We\u2019re trying to not get into a place, Paul, where we end up giving detailed numbers on all of our major assets. But Eagle Ford we felt we needed to do it because at the rate that it\u2019s growing and the impact that it\u2019s having not just on our U.S. business but the corporation as a whole, we felt we needed to give investors\u2019 guidance on that asset because it\u2019s fairly unique in our portfolio at this point.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Clarence, in the Eagle Ford, the wells that you\u2019re going to drill in 2013, are they \u2013 what\u2019s the percentage going to be in the closing window and comparing that to 2012?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, I think Paul, it\u2019s about, let me check, I want to say about 75% or 75% to 80% of our wells are in the high GOR trend, but the bulk of the rest are in the condensate window. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll confirm that, but\u2026","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Do you have that number for 2012, so I just wanted to see that how that is being shift?","Clarence Cazalot","It was actually about the same, Paul, in 2012. So even though we have said we\u2019re going to focus as much as we can in the high-GOR window this year because of the lower NGO and gas prices. Last year with trying to hold leases and meet our obligations as it turns out, we\u2019ll have about the same proportion in the high GOR window in 2013 as we did in 2012.","Had we embarked on our original plan before we saw the collapse in NGO prices. We have a much percent in the condensate window. That was part of our plan originally was to accelerate our drilling there, but again with what\u2019s happened with NGO prices and we redirected that to the high GOR area.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good afternoon. I think got the well is of the Eagle Ford at about $8.5 million per well, where you guys are at right now. Well, how much of your wells coming in at the Bakken?","Janet Clark","Probably $8.5 to $8.8 million.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Janet Clark","We still think, Faisel, that\u2019s best-in-class up there.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Fair enough. Any more potential improvement on that number going forward to the year or is that pretty much as kind of\u2026","Clarence Cazalot","Little bit we were in 2013, most of our wells are going to be on pad drilling, but we don\u2019t see as much savings on pads in the Bakken because to a certain extent we are doing at the Bakken for access to locations topography issues and we actually end up drilling longer laterals from some of the pads that offsets some of the cost savings you get in less movement, less move days. So, we don\u2019t see a lot of improvement at this point Khan, but we continue to believe our costs are going to be the best in class.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the per unit profitability in the U.S. E&P. You\u2019ve certainly have ramped up the production in a pretty high clip in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. And just want to understand, when do we see that sort of bottom line results from all that production ramp, because when you look at the 2012 per unit cost, per unit profitability came down versus 2011. So, just want to understand how you guys are thinking about per unit profitability of this sort of assets going forward over the next couple of years?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah. I think, certainly the cash \u2013 the unit cash margins are going to \u2013 going to be strong because as we\u2019ve shown here, our cash cost whether fuel level controllables or the other costs are coming down and driven a large part by the higher volumes.","The earnings contribution is going to be a bit more muted and again it comes back to the impact that Eagle Ford has on the overall DD&A rate. So, when you look at 2012 actual and the 2013 guidance, we\u2019ve given you the 2013 DD&A rate is going up pretty significantly and that is largely due to the Eagle Ford barrels now being a larger component of our U.S. production.","So, as we see that Eagle Ford DD&A rate come down in subsequent years as we book both performance reserves as well as the higher and hopefully initial bookings as our confidence in the reservoir performance growth. We\u2019re going to see that DD&A rate come down, but in the mean time, it is going to have that impact on earnings margins while cash margins, I think are going to in a continued improve. With RF force, as I mentioned before seeing declines in our Gulf of Mexico barrels which had been very strong cash flow providers in the past.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Fair enough. And then, last question from me. On \u2013 it seems like if I read your numbers correctly on the infrastructure that you guys have spent in the Eagle Ford and what\u2019s you plan spending in the Eagle Ford that you\u2019ll have over $1 billion sort of invested capital in sort of midstream and infrastructure assets in the Eagle Ford.","In the long run, I know there was a question on the MLP, but do these assets get sold eventually, when you reached sort of that peak production level or do they have to remain part of the upstream portfolio and what\u2019s your opinion on and I believe these assets have to remain with the company or not?","Clarence Cazalot","Well, again, I\u2019m not sure that we get quite to a $1 billion. My math that didn\u2019t get me there. But it is does become a very significant investment nonetheless and I think obviously the number one priority for us in terms of that infrastructure is flow assurance and the ability to move to where we see the best realizations.","So, if we can achieve that, that\u2019s why I come back to this question around MLPs. That\u2019s not our primary interest today. Ultimately it\u2019s an MLP or it\u2019s a flat out sale of the assets someone else, who will own them and operate them and we\u2019ll pay a tariff or throughput the. We\u2019ll certainly look at that. But again, you don\u2019t want to have whatever ultimate production is out here well over 100,000 barrels a day held hostage to midstream assets. You want to be able to control that. So, you can control again the ultimate commercial \u2013 commerciality and marketing of your barrels.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kate Minyard of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on \u2013 kind of reconciling the DD&A costs especially in the U.S. and the Eagle Ford on a go forward basis for 2013 to the F&D costs. Given that you talked about preliminary F&D being about 17 per BOE, but attributed the lot of the bookings to the Eagle Ford and Bakken and Oklahoma. Just trying to look at how the F&D kind of reconciles with the DD&A expected in U.S. E&P and further there is some infrastructure costs that are loaded into the DD&A, but maybe wouldn\u2019t be reflected in the F&D costs, and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Clarence Cazalot","Well it\u2019s not a simple calculation, Kate I think there is a component of midstream in the DD&A rate, but it\u2019s not a big component. In the DD&A rate obviously are the acquisition costs that we\u2019ve incurred in the Eagle Ford, so that is the substantial component of it. The other thing is when you calculate DD&A rates, it\u2019s largely on the P1s of approved developed reserves whereas when you look at our F&D costs, it\u2019s proved develop and proved undeveloped. So you\u2019ve got a larger reserve \u2013 proved reserve figure in the F&D cost than you would have in the DD&A rate. And I think those are primary reasons.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, and then my related follow-up is whether the idea that you are not able to book the whole well EURs initially whether we could then expect to see maybe a catch up or a sudden sort of influx of significantly more efficiently added reserves, maybe in 2013 or in 2014 as you\u2019ve kind of proved performance in the place and whether that would then turned lower F&D costs in future years. Thanks.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it goes to future reserve bookings and that goes to F&D costs and they are going to go to DD&A rate and two things happen. One is as you begin to produce the well in a current year you will book as I\u2019ve said a portion of the EORs then you will book the rest over subsequent years as you see performance and as our reserve auditors get the comfort that it\u2019s more likely than not that these reserves are going to be \u2013 are going to be recovered and so you got incremental reserve bookings strong performance.","You also potentially as you go through the future years and the confidence in the EOR grows your initial reserve booking. At the time you bring that well on production will rise as well. So, all of that contributes obviously to F&D cost as well as it does to lowering the DD&A rate over time.","The way DD&A rate works if you look at just the life of a project, when you start out in the early days of production, the DD&A rate is way too high. And when the last barrel is produced the DD&A rate is way too low, somewhere in between there it really is the average. It is the right number. But that\u2019s kind of the nature of these emerging plays, where there isn\u2019t a lot of long production history that can give us a certainty to book the full reserves upfront.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Malone of Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead.","John Malone \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Yeah good afternoon. Clarence it sounds like you want to withhold comment on the Eagle Ford pilot programs until Q2. Can you speak it also I think the five distinct projects you are running that\u2019s still the numbers I think falling off and also are there any open choke well as you think is going to run some of the broad object I can prove your point it does?","Clarence Cazalot","Okay. John we have nine pilot projects underway and we\u2019re withholding \u2013 we\u2019re not withholding comment because we\u2019re trying to hide anything. It\u2019s just as you recognized. It\u2019s not until you get meaningful production performance out of these pilot projects that you can begin to draw some conclusions and as it has been suggested to me by my people where even to do so, to draw conclusions by the middle of this year, we\u2019re pressing it a bit. But nevertheless what we\u2019re looking at is pilots to test the lateral displacement of the wells, the horizontal displacement of wells within the reservoir as well as different stimulation methods including to your point, some of the wells looking at larger choke sizes. So, we\u2019re on a course to learn as much as we can, as rapidly as we can in the Eagle Ford, so that we can then make that part of our standard operating practice and as we drill 300 or so wells a year, do so in the way that gives us the highest value.","John Malone \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Okay, thanks. And then just unrelated, in Kazakhstan, anything you could say as you\u2019ve learned from the Europe well and how it in France, what they\u2019re going to do in the next wells there in South?","Clarence Cazalot","It\u2019s \u2013 we saw very good reservoir in the well that is encouraging. There appears to be perhaps a bit more structural complexity in the \u2013 at least on the harrier prospect than we may have thought the seismic quality there is not very good, so being able to image the sub-surfaces as well as we like is a bit challenging. But I would say that at this stage, the prospects we see, the other prospect on the same block and the prospect on the other block are rather unique and I think we still hold out high hope for those and we\u2019ll have those drilled pretty quickly here.","John Malone \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Arif of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Amir Arif \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks, good afternoon. In the Eagle Ford, if you keep with a 300 rig program roughly, at what point does production start to flatten out or level out, can you give us a sense of that.","Clarence Cazalot","I\u2019m sorry, did you say with the 300 well program?","Amir Arif \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah.","Clarence Cazalot","Again, I think that\u2019s the question we are going to try to resolve in the second half of this year when we have the results of the pilot program. So, I\u2019ll give you an example. We have previously I think at the time of the Hilcorp acquisition talked about peak production of 125,000 BOE a day. As you can see from the numbers we\u2019ve given for guidance for 2013, we should exit 2013 at about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Depending upon the overall size of the resource base we have here, which again is going to be determined in large part by the pilot results.","We could have a decade of drilling out here at current drilling levels. And so, exceeding 125,000 barrels a day I think is a very likely outcome, but I think as I indicated before, we don\u2019t want to build up to some peak of say \u2013 let\u2019s just say for purpose is 150,000 barrels a day only to see that decline within a year or two. Our preference would be to go to a lower level that we can sustain for a longer period of time again and so we can optimize our mid stream investment and not overbuild capacity that\u2019s going to be underutilized. So, I can\u2019t give you a number. I think at this time, I think we see tremendous upside for this play. We\u2019re going to be in this play for a long period of time and as we get, get the full data set from our station pilots, we\u2019ll be able to give better guidance on where we see this has set ultimately getting to.","Amir Arif \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I appreciate the color. And then, just in terms of the second question. You got a very active exploration portfolio going on. Which one prospect you\u2019d see the most excited in terms of the resources upside that you\u2019re testing here in the first half. Would it be that the Gabon well?","Clarence Cazalot","If I do that, I\u2019m going to put the Gregory on it. I hate to do that. That\u2019s bad luck. They are all good prospects.","Amir Arif \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reed of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger, if your line is on mute. Can you un-mute your phone. Okay. We\u2019ll move on. The next question is from the Eliot Javanmardi of Capital One. Please go ahead.","Eliot Javanmardi \u2013 Capital One","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just a quick question. First, I wanted to make sure, I heard clearly the 6% to 13% stretch target for production. Could you clarify the timeline on that and what that includes just as that totally we\u2019re looking at excluding Libya?","Howard Thill","It\u2019s\u2026","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah go ahead Howard.","Howard Thill","That\u2019s total upstream production excluding Libya out of both 2012 and 2013 and excluding the Alaska asset at both 2012 and 2013. So the way we casted early last year was, we were going to grow at 6% to 8% excluding Libya and dispositions. And so Alaska was disposed, so we\u2019ve taken that out of both years and Libya as well. So that\u2019s where you get to the 6% to 12% to 13% excluding those. But, the target we set last year was 6% to 8%. That\u2019s the target we\u2019re living by.","Eliot Javanmardi \u2013 Capital One","Sure. Absolutely, absolutely. And just a short follow up then \u2013 or even a separate question, excuse, if you have it in front of you, what is comprised of other U.S. production at this point in time. How much of that is Gulf of Mexico and what else is out there?","Clarence Cazalot","Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019ll give you that number here. Rocky Mountain, some non-operated Permian, some Oklahoma, East Texas, conventional plays, those are the majority of the other U.S\u2026.","Eliot Javanmardi \u2013 Capital One","Okay.","Clarence Cazalot","Gulf of Mexico is 18 in 2013.","Janet Clark","Well, Gulf of Mexico.","Eliot Javanmardi \u2013 Capital One","Gulf of Mexico is 18, I\u2019m sorry?","Janet Clark","Yes.","Eliot Javanmardi \u2013 Capital One","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Apologize if you mentioned this already, but did you have any negative natural gas reserve revisions last year?","Janet Clark","We did do to prices, but very minimal, not large parties.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. It\u2019s immaterial basically?","Janet Clark","Yeah.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then just a quick one on going back to the, what you mentioned about the Canadian potential sale, as you know there has been a lot of political debate in Canada over allowing foreign acquisitions particularly in the Oil Sands. Do you see that as a hurdle to potentially monetizing a portion of that asset.","Clarence Cazalot","No. I would only say that I think that the recent Canadian announcements around foreign engagement in their assets is actually been a help because if we were to do a sale of a portion of our interest in AOSP. It would be a non-operated interest in a joint venture and that is something that they\u2019ve actually given a greater certainty around, greater confidence in being approved. So, it\u2019s actually removed an uncertainty I would say that was out there previously.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Well, I appreciated it guys.","Clarence Cazalot","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah, hi. Just a quick one on reserve bookings. I guess philosophic. You guys, are being more conservative than your peers and as you\u2019re getting into more on conventional exposure. Why don\u2019t you have comparable 5% interest. Many of your peers are in the 30s or higher.","Clarence Cazalot","John, I think well actually this year is pretty close to 30% then if you back out the oil sands which of course is essentially \u2013 and actually are more than that. I don\u2019t have all the numbers in front of me, but I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ll think of ourselves is conservative in fact we try to go straight up the middle of the fair way following the SEC guidelines, which as you know are inherently conservative.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yes, right.","Clarence Cazalot","What we think, if it is ultimate EUR is actually prove was probably because the definition of prove was first probable is as likely as not \u2013 is this likely is not that you will outperform as underperformed?","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, Janet. Most of your larger peers are in the 40s, and I don\u2019t think you were quite that high even though just to get out, but thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

I am Howard Thill, Vice President of Corporate, Government and Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; J. R. Sult, EVP and CFO. As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with our earnings release. You can find those remarks and the associated slides at marathonoil.com.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and our comments and answers to questions will contain forward-looking statements, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Tillman","Well good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. Prior to opening up for your questions, I want to recognize the outstanding operational performance achieved by our dedicated employees and contractors in not only the fourth quarter, but for the full year. Since I\u2019ve joined Marathon Oil in August of last year, I\u2019ve had the privilege of getting to know the people and the assets that drive our results. We are a results driven company with a clear focus on shareholder value.","And it\u2019s not just our results, but how we achieve those results. Our firm commitment to core value, safety, health, the environment, security, business ethics, compliance and social responsibility is part of our DNA and how we run the business each and every day. It has been a remarkable 2013 for our Company and for our shareholders.","We grew year-over-year production 11% excluding Libya and Alaska, exceeding our commitment of 8% to 10%, and our U.S. resource play production increased 86% over 2012. Our outstanding Eagle Ford team set the pace with 138% increase in production over 2012, and notably during the last two weeks of the year our Eagle Ford production crossed a significant milestone averaging in excess of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","We also had an outstanding reserve replacement ratio for 2013 of 194%, excluding divestitures. As part of our rigorous portfolio management, we reached $3.5 billion in closed or agreed divestitures over the past three years and we anticipate closing the Angola Block 31 sale on or around February 11th. Additionally, we have commenced the marketing of our UK and Norway businesses.","We maintained our capital discipline by delivering our results within our $5.2 billion capital budget, excluding acquisitions. And during 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend 12% to $0.19 per share and repurchased 14 million shares of stock, returning about a billion dollars to our shareholders.","We recognize the importance of delivering on our commitments and our guidance quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year and the fourth quarter continued that theme. $1.1 billion in cash flow from continuing operations, over 98% reliability in our operated assets, 35% production increase in the U.S. resource plays and combined production in our North American international segments above the midpoint of our guidance.","With our high quality assets and ability to execute, we look for continued solid production growth and believe there is a strong investment case for Marathon Oil. Not only achieving but excelling across the seven strategic imperatives that we laid out at our Analyst Day is our corporate strategy and the roadmap for how we plan to become the premier independent E&P.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Howard.","Howard Thill","Thanks, Lee. Before we open the call for questions, we\u2019d like to remind you that, we\u2019d request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications and you can re-prompt as time permits.","With that Christine, we\u2019ll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Lee Tillman","Good morning Guy.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Understanding it was just a couple of months ago that you may be announcing about divesting North Sea assets I was just wondering if you could talk about how that marketing process is progressing. When do you expect to have a data room open? Just trying to get a better sense of timing and how quickly you all have been able to move that process along so far?","Lee Tillman","Yes, thanks for the question Guy, this is Lee. Yes, we are often running on the marketing effort. We\u2019re still committed towards a target of closing that transaction towards the end of 2014. Consistent with that we\u2019re working hard to get a data room open here in the first quarter to ensure that we stay on-track relative to that timing.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, F&D cost at $16 a barrel, [saw it as a] [ph] replacement, the lowest F&D rate for you all in a number of years. My question is just how that compared to what you had expected and were striving for internally coming into 2013? Is there any area that may have surprised positively relative to your expectations? And then relatedly do you all have any targets that you could share with respect to your goals for F&D costs on a go forward basis?","Lee Tillman","Yes, now we\u2019re very pleased with our F&D cost performance and I probably should emphasize that that is based on total GAAP incurred cost as well just as you start comparing that number perhaps out to some of our peer group. A lot of that of course is driven by some outstanding performance in our U.S. resource plays as you looked at our proved reserve adds you can see the contribution certainly from North America that is the standout and that was part of a very I would say focused effort to ensure that we had appropriately booked and accounted for the growth that we were seeing in those resource plays. And that\u2019s really the uplift that you\u2019re seeing this year that\u2019s driving that excellent reserves replacement.","As we shared at the Analyst Day there still remains an incredible amount of 2P resource and potential total resource growth in those resource plays. And again we of course have internal targets that we look at and challenge our asset teams with, but we have clear line of sight on 100% reserve replacement or greater as we move forward in the next couple of years.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you for the comments.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Guy. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. And just good morning Lee and Howard congratulations on the production growth last year and obviously a strong cash flow growth. As we look into \u201914 obviously the shale plays can continue to drive cash flows higher, but you will lose something internationally. Maybe just help us understand your view of, you\u2019ve given production guidance, but how sort of net cash margins should change into \u201914 versus \u201913 say on a flat oil price deck? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-on around deferred tax.","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well first Ed I think you point out a good component though looking forward in our portfolio which is, we are naturally going to move toward a higher weighting toward North America volumes and the margins that those generate. Traditionally, we have seen those to be a course higher cash margin than what we\u2019d experienced in some aspects of our international portfolio. So we see that as a net positive.","That I think coupled with our continued focus on high liquids content at both our production as well as our reserves we think are going to contribute to very profitable growth moving forward. So, a lot of that mix effect, I think we will be able to take advantage of moving forward.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And the follow-up is on deferred tax and you obviously you gave some details on it in the release. But just looking forward I mean it seems like it was smaller than perhaps I was modeling, perhaps other people on the call. Maybe just give us a breakdown of how much deferred tax was in the U.S. and how much was international and maybe how that will pan out into \u201914 given that you are probably cash tax payor in [our time] [ph], but get some benefits in the U.S.?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Well I\u2019ll maybe handover to J.R. just to address maybe the tax question more on a holistic basis, because we are driving our kind of statutory tax rate down over time, but J.R. if you want to comment on some of the timing effects that we saw at the end of 2013.","J. R. Sult","Yes. Good morning Ed, how are you? Lee is right as we outlined at the Analyst Day we do see our overall aggregate effective tax rate continue to decline as the mix of our production shifts more and more to North America. When I look at Q4 Ed nothing really stands out in terms of being individually significant. As you know there is always two factors that impact Q4 when you look at our overall tax provision including our deferred taxes. Number one is, in Q4 we always ultimately true-up our deferred taxes and all our tax accounts to the filed statutory tax returns in all of our jurisdictions, U.S., sovereign, foreign as well, state and local so that\u2019s one element that\u2019s always going to be running through Q4.","Just as well as finally truing up our final effective tax rate, as you know we go out throughout the year and we estimate what we think that rate is going to be over the next 12 calendar months. And ultimately have to true-up that based on the final mix of our earnings. And I think it\u2019s a little bit of both of those component pieces Ed in terms of true-up to the final tax return just as well as getting the final mix of income by jurisdiction that might have driven a few anomalies none of which are individually significant.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","But just in terms of outlook in \u201914, do you think that you will be paying some decent tax in Norway and having some benefits in the U.S., is that how you\u2026?","J. R. Sult","Absolutely I mean in the U.S. with the capital program that we have running you will not see us be a U.S. cash tax payor for a number of years. Norway, EG, all of our taxpaying jurisdictions and it\u2019s fair to assume effectively that all of my taxes for the most part for modeling purposes are current. And so I think you should expect to see that going forward into 2014 together with the overall guidance that we gave in terms of the effective tax rate for the year.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","J. R. Sult","Thanks Ed.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Well, thanks. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.","Lee Tillman","Good morning Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I\u2019ll take my two as well if I may, so Lee in the event that you are successful in selling Norway and the UK. You are going to remove some fairly high decline assets from your portfolio. Would you be able to give us some kind of pro forma CapEx and growth rate ex the sales, because the growth rate obviously has been diluted by the decline rate, so if we really just focus on the onshore assets, ex those assets what does CapEx and growth look like? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up please.","Lee Tillman","Okay, yes, sure, absolutely. So let me maybe take on the volumes growth piece first, I believe in our Analyst Day we talked a little bit about that on a pro forma basis and the way we really couched it in a pro forma sense was to say well when you look at our 2012 to 2017 compound annual growth rate based on our current portfolio, we had committed to 5% to 7% externally.","When we in a pro forma sense, ex Norway and the UK assets, that pro forma growth moves to 8% to 10% over that 2012 to 2017 period. We haven\u2019t given any specific CapEx guidance on that but what I will tell you and I think we also shared this in the Analyst Day is that we are in relatively high investment years in both the UK and Norway.","As you are aware Doug in Norway we are in the installation phase of the boiler project this year, which will have a very high CapEx demand between the installation as well as the associated drilling. In addition to that, we are doing some development drilling in the UK also. So 2014 is actually a bit of a high investment year and we\u2019re probably north in a combined sense in 2014, north of $500 million of capital investment in the UK and Norway.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll put it under the numbers. But I guess my follow-up is kind of relatedly because assuming you secure the sales of these assets at some point and given the growth in the Lower 48, it strikes us that you are fairly flushed with cash. Obviously the buyback is part of the process, but where is your, -- where I guess is management\u2019s head out at this point. I mean bear in mind you are still relatively new to the Company. Are you at the point now where you are ready to reload the portfolio? Are you happy with the current portfolio structure meaning that incremental cash continues to buy back stock? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yes, okay, great, now good question. And probably maybe a good bridge to my previous answer Doug is when I talk about that 8% to 10% CAGR that also presumes that you are simply removing the pro forma performance of UK and Norway. It makes no assumption about how you might use those reinvestment proceeds to grow the business organically. So I think it\u2019s important to make that statement.","But in terms of if we are successful in the North Sea marketing case I think we\u2019re going to go back to the capital allocation process that we talked about and described pretty fully in the Analyst Day. Our first call on capital is going to be looking for those long-term accretive organic investments in the business. From there we\u2019ll take a look at how can we do an effective job of resource capture, whether that\u2019d be through business development or through our exploration program.","After that we\u2019re going to ensure that we deliver our dividend commitment to our shareholders and as I mentioned that\u2019s running just around $500 million a year at current rate. Of course and all the while ensuring that we\u2019re protecting our investment grade balance sheet. And I think once we work through those calls on capitals, we\u2019re going to look very carefully at opportunistic share repurchases as well as an option to bring value to our shareholder. But that\u2019s the strategy that you will see us apply and of course we have to do that in the context of the business environment at that point in time that we find ourselves from a commodity price standpoint et cetera.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks for the answers Lee.","Lee Tillman","","Thank you, Doug.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good morning guys and thanks for taking the question allocations. First I know utilization\u2019s impact to the quarter and really given uncertainty and volatility in the spreads and particularly Brent LS as it relates to your Eagle Ford volumes I mean do you have any greater interest or see the potential to term-up volumes with the refiner to provide surety around that forward spread?","Lee Tillman","I\u2019ll maybe start the answer and then invite Howard and J.R. to jump in there. Because that\u2019s clearly a big feature of the release this quarter as the realizations and I think you bring up a great point which is our Eagle Ford volumes are really driven from a realization standpoint to LLS. And through a lot of activity the LLS Brent spread was under some challenge. We also of course saw some challenge in the Bakken as well on the spread. And then finally on Western Canada select we also saw some challenges there. So the spreads and realizations are very important too at this quarter.","On the positive, those had generally moved back in line with where we had been earlier in 2013, but maybe I\u2019ll ask Howard just to comment specifically on some of the factors we saw impacting the Eagle Ford LLS impact and then perhaps J.R. could comment a bit on our overall I would say risk management strategy around commodity risk.","Howard Thill","Sure. Thanks Lee and thanks for the question Evan. To Lee\u2019s point what we saw was from the third quarter where LLS and Brent were essentially imparity we saw that really widen to about an $8 differential between LLS and Brent and of course there is a lot of the crude that you wouldn\u2019t typically think of besides just the Eagle Ford that has an LLS component to it the Bakken being one of them because of rail and other pricing mechanisms that saw that drive those prices lower.","To Lee\u2019s point in January we\u2019ve already seen that discount close from that $8 down to about $4 and so it continues to narrow that was really from what we\u2019ve seen that was really driven by the opening up of the southern leg of Keystone XL as well as reversal of the Ho-Ho line into Houston.","And so what you had was that that bottleneck really moved from a WTI pricing Cushing to a Gulf Coast price LLS and as that\u2019s been absorbed then you\u2019ve seeing that those differentials as I\u2019ve said really start to close and maybe not back to normal but getting back to more of where we were on a pre-fourth quarter basis.","Lee Tillman","Yes, thanks for that Howard. J.R.?","J. R. Sult","Yes, I mean Evan two quick things Evan not to pile on to listen to three folks answer your single question but number one is we are also looking at additional commercial solutions that would give us additional outlets for our crude to increase our optionality around what markets we ultimately go to. The other thing I would say so that\u2019s more of a commercial focus, on the financial focus of course we have had in the past and we will continue to look for opportunistic financial hedging potential.","We just had some fairly successful positions in 2013. I would tell you that given the strength of our financial position however I think we have a lot of optionality in terms of how we manage our aggregate risk from a cash flow standpoint. But again we watch very carefully and confidentially those forward markets and we\u2019ll take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. My second question thanks for that full response. My second question is related on the commercial side on crude oil exports, and has Marathon filed for an export permit or swap which sounds more right, with commerce and if not I guess why not and what is your strategy there to help break that potential supply log jam in the Gulf Coast?","Lee Tillman","Well, clearly it\u2019s encouraging to us as a Company to see the crude export issue being out there and discussed openly now. I mean if you rewind back not so long ago that was not the case we were hard pressed to get any traction around that, but now I think there is some traction in the political circle. Bur I still think it\u2019s a challenge to move it all the way to a full opening of exports but some of the swaps and some of the export permits that folks are talking about we\u2019re monitoring that we\u2019ve not entered into any swaps or any export permits at this time.","We\u2019re really spending our time with ensuring that we communicate the significant advantages that an export option will generate for the U.S., both on the producers, the refiners as well as the consumers side. And so we\u2019re spending our time with the influence leaders, the policy makers to ensure that they have the facts, they understand how that will positively impact the overall situation here in the U.S. whether you take a look at it from a consumer position and price at the top or whether you look at it from a balance and trade standpoint. But certainly with the growth and the economic growth that is being generated in the North America resource plays we need to continue to enable that and to me it\u2019s a natural next step for us to move into a commodity situation we\u2019re in the world open market that benefits the producers that benefits the consumers it doesn\u2019t in any way damage our energy security but rather I think creates opportunities for further growth here in the U.S.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks guys.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Evan.","J. R. Sult","Thanks Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yes hi. Two quick ones, that are unconventional. Could you split your Anadarko Base and acreage between the SCOOP, the Cana Woodford and the [misspa\u2019s]? And is it fair to say if you do monetize your North Sea assets that capital will flow towards this region as well?","Lee Tillman","Okay. Yes, I mean I would just maybe answer the question a bit generally we typically have not split out our acreage. And we\u2019ve shown some maps I think in our Analyst Day which gives you a feel of the general acreage spread between SCOOP as well as the Southern Mississippi trend the core kind of Cana Woodford and then also even the Granite Wash as well. What I will tell you is that we are essentially doubling and have doubled the rig count in our Oklahoma resource basins. You might recall from our Analyst Day we talked about ramping-up across all of our resource plays to a 28 rig program.","I am pleased to confirm that we are at that 28 rig count today, so we have ramped-up a very effectively early in 2014. We\u2019re looking very closely at the SCOOP. We\u2019re doing some work there on some extended reach wells where we\u2019re looking at much longer horizontal sections to continue to drive those wells to be economically competitive with our best wells in the Eagle Ford as well as the Bakken. We absolutely see the Oklahoma resource basin as an area of future growth and future capital allocation and competition. So we see it very much as a growth opportunity for us.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, thanks Lee. Next one is on the Bakken. You have been completing a lot of Three Forks wells, how they have been performing?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I know that there has been a little bit of chatter out there on Three Forks\u2019 performance, so let me be really clear on this. We have got a considerable amount of our production today that\u2019s in the Three Forks first bench about 20% of our production today is there. We have a very aggressive Three Forks development program in 2014 that includes not only first bench, but also second bench piloting. In our particular acreage areas which we believe to be very high quality, we\u2019re seeing excellent performance and tight curves from the Three Forks first bench and we look forward to testing what the second bench can deliver as well.","I think what you are hearing is that there is a natural variability across the plays which whether you are talking about the middle Bakken or the Three Forks first bench depending upon where your acreage is located, there is going to be a natural variability in the quality and based on the type curves that we have seen thus far particularly in the Three Forks first bench we have no concerns there.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Thanks for taking the question, so obviously some kind of discouraging results initially in Ethiopia and Kenya. As you look to your next prospect, can you give us a sense of the capital at risk in both countries?","Lee Tillman","Yes, well of course we have a relatively robust exploration program in 2014, it\u2019s running right now. Our capital budget is right around 500 million for our global exploration program. In Ethiopia and Kenya you are right I would say we have had mixed results there. What we\u2019re currently doing in both basins though as you know in these rift plays you have basins within sub-basins. There has been good success of course in Ethiopia and Kenya in the rift plays and we\u2019re now moving over in general to the opposite side of the rift to test fully those very large acreage positions.","But we are looking to moderate our capital exposure in those areas until we can confirm working hydrocarbon systems and prospectivity. We\u2019re doing that in really a non-operated position with our partners there with two very reliable operators Tello and Africa Oil. So, we remain hopeful. These are extremely large acreage positions that we\u2019re looking at here. They\u2019re still in our view competing favorably for capital within our exploration program. But I would just caution that it\u2019s still very early days in these plays.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay. You also remarked in the press release that even so far this year you have not had any liftings from Libyan oil terminals close but we have heard from some of other operators that in fact there has been improvement over the last perhaps three to four weeks. Are your operations kind of distinct from that or are you seeing any improvement perhaps more recently?","Lee Tillman","Yes, well I think there of course is news each and every day coming out of Libya and I know you guys read it just like we do. It remains a very fluid situation there, very unpredictable. Hence the reason we carry Libya volumes really below the line due to that unpredictability. There is positive data. There is a lot of difference though between the east and the west and where your terminals happen to be located. And of course we still today are not doing liftings. We don\u2019t have a clear view of when those liftings may or may not restart.","On the positive side we do know that the quality of the resource is such as that when we can restart we will be able to ramp-up production relatively quickly and efficiently and get back on track in Libya. That\u2019s the real shame here, is that this really is a world-class resource and if we can just get access again to our export solution. It\u2019d had some real benefits for the partners that we have there in the Waha concession.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Okay, great. I appreciate it guys.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Pavel.","Howard Thill","Thanks Pavel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Malone of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Hi, good morning gentlemen. Just sticking with international for a moment, you saw a drop in international reserves, if read correctly, can you lay out sort of what international projects sanctions are that are coming up that are pushed that back into the block?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I guess just on the reserves piece, we did have adds in the international space. If you look at the table that was provided in the press release, we did have proved reserved in our international E&P space and they were relatively significant. In addition, we did have some reserves as well in our oil sands mining.","In terms of investment opportunities, I\u2019ve mentioned one of those already which is the boiler project that\u2019s going on in Norway along with boiler there is some development drilling that\u2019s occurring also in Norway as well as in the UK which are contributing to those proved reserve adds.","Looking forward in time, we also development drilling this year in Equatorial Guinea where we\u2019re drilling one development well. And so we continue to see investment opportunities as well as very strong reservoir performance. In Norway\u2019s case and point we continue to move the needle there and overall base reservoir performance that remains the case. We\u2019re still seeing very strong performance even with water breakthrough at the all time field the overall reservoir performance there is quite strong.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Okay. Thanks. And then just specific to Kurdistan, you\u2019re looking for first all potential out of Atrush next year. Now given the current political situation, would you see having a change before you be comfortable actually exporting oil out of your assets there?","Lee Tillman","Well, again this is a discussion that\u2019s ongoing between the south and the north and clearly we\u2019re going comply with the guidance that we received not only from the Kurdistan Regional Authority but also the sovereign government of Iraq. Our field development plan that was put in for Atrush reflected essentially what we would consider to be an early production system of first phase of development that essentially would be three wells producing around 30,000 gross barrels a day.","The plan that was submitted reflected an export solution of trucking as opposed to a pipeline solution. We\u2019re of course keenly interested in an export solution via pipe from Kurdistan but we\u2019re going to let that process play out between the regional authority as well as the sovereign government there that\u2019s something we are certainly encouraging, it adds a tremendous amount of value to our blocks in Kurdistan of which we have three blocks today, where we\u2019re doing no more work and have a transition to soften block over to total.","So we have three blocks one operated, two non-operated with discoveries on all three. So, we\u2019re still very positive on our position in Kurdistan, if the export solution does come to fruition on the pipe side that\u2019s just going to add incremental value and potentially allow us to proceed at a faster pace from a phasing standpoint as we won\u2019t be limited to a trucking solution.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks Lee.","Lee Tillman","Thank you. You bet.","Howard Thill","Thanks John.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from [Jeff Rambajon] [ph] of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst"," ","Good morning guys.","Lee Tillman","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst"," ","Just my question is on U.S. ops, are there any updates to the spacing parts and progress in the Bakken or, which was taken about in terms of down spacing potential across your position or what do you like to see from offset operators some with tighter spacing there?","Lee Tillman","Okay. Yes I mean on the Bakken I think we did a pretty comprehended job of describing where we were headed in the Bakken on spacing. One of the things we talked about at the Analyst Day of course are high-density pilots where we\u2019re combining the middle Bakken as well as the Three Forks off of single-pad drilling. Those pilots are still moving forward but we are aggressively pursuing down spacing particularly in our high quality acreage, it\u2019s something where we\u2019re keenly interested and that\u2019s what is contributing to the increase in resource potential that we described at the Analyst Day.","But really I would say we haven\u2019t, we don\u2019t really have new data to share today relative to the Analyst Day that\u2019s only a couple of months and that really hasn\u2019t given us enough run time yet to come out and state definitively the impact ultimately of the down spacing.","Unidentified Analyst"," ","Okay. And on the SCOOP you guys talked about that on the Analyst Day as well regard to extend the laterals, is there any update there as far as how those are progressing?","Lee Tillman","Yes, but we\u2019re just now starting our extended lateral program there. Again, we feel very encouraged about what we\u2019re seeing as we continue to optimize completions in the SCOOP area. We see very strong incremental well economics. So, again it\u2019s really a question, now Jeffery of getting a bit of cumulative production from those wells and being able to really understand the impact not only on ITs but ultimately the EUR.","Unidentified Analyst"," ","Thanks guys.","Lee Tillman","Okay. Thanks Jeffery.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Arif of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks, good morning guys.","Lee Tillman","Good morning.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, just first question on the Oklahoma resource base and can you just give us a breakout of the roughly the 20, 25 wells you\u2019re going to be drilling this year, how much are going in each in the southern way of the SCOOP and the Granite Wash?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given specific breakdown on the well count. I would say that really what we\u2019re trying to do though in the Oklahoma Woodford is ensure that we work the capital efficiency and optimization question in the SCOOP. In the Granite Wash as well as the Southern Mississippi line, it\u2019s more a question of really understanding the resource base there. So, those two programs are really kind of somewhat complementary to one another.","But right now, we\u2019re looking at something like probably a couple of wells in the Granite Wash to against our proving up that resource four wells in the Southern Mississippi line trend to again help us really understand that resource base and ultimately position us for the development.","So, SCOOP really focused on capital efficiency, completion optimization, the extended lateral. And then in parallel, really testing the development potential that exist in the Granite Wash in the Southern Mississippi line.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then as a follow-up and for the southern miss, where you have drilled two wells could you tell us what you thought at the results, what the oil cuts were and how that compares in terms of returns to what you have in the SCOOP?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I would just say, right now, I mean we\u2019re way to early probably to talk about those results with high confidence, I would say maybe stay tuned and watch the space. As soon as we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019ve got enough production behind us, we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019ll bring out those results and talk about them in a more full-some sense.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Amir.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our next question is from Jeff Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment. Please go ahead.","Jeff Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","Good morning.","Lee Tillman","Good morning. ","Jeff Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","My first question is with regard to the Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford, I was wondering, first of all, what percentage of your current acreage is potentially perspective for these Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford combination completions? And as the second part of that how many successful tests do you require before you can begin to talk more specifically about locations in EUR uplift?","Lee Tillman","Now, good question Jeff, and again we spend of quite bit of time at the Analyst Day on the Austin Chalk, when you talk about prospectively across our acreage position. Really what we\u2019re doing with our pilots, Jeff, is really delineating that prospectively today, I mean we have our models but we really need to confirm that by stepping around our play with the bid and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing with our pilot testing.","The early results from the Austin Chalk wells though are very compelling as we shared at the Analyst Day, the type curves of the Austin Chalk wells looked very, very similar to what we have observed in our Eagle Ford wells of similar lateral length. So we remain very encouraged. Again, as we get more run time on the pilots we will bring that story forward but we are in the process of really understanding the full extent of the Austin Chalk around our core acreage position.","Jeff Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","Okay. Great, that\u2019s helpful. And my other question was with regard to the Southern Mississippi trend, I was wondering if you also have exposure to the Hunton lime if that is something you\u2019re taking a look at, I\u2019m thinking like Logan, Kingfisher County that area? Thank you.","Lee Tillman","I\u2019m sorry, I lost the first part of the question Jeff.","Jeff Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","What I was asking was I was wondering if you had any exposure to the Hunton limestone, I\u2019m thinking Kingfisher, Logan County that kind of area if that\u2019s something you have exposure to and if you might plan any testing on it?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I would probably have to get back to you, I don\u2019t have a specific answer on that one Jeff. I know the horizons we are looking at but I\u2019m not familiar if we\u2019ve really assessed the position on the lime there.","Jeff Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment","Okay.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Phillips. Mr. Philips, you may begin.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil's first quarter 2016 earnings call. I am Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations.","Joining me on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, President and CEO; J.R.

Please read our disclosures in our earnings release and in our SEC filings for a discussion of these items.","Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the course of the information package on our website.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program consistent with our plan and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance.","Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower risk, higher return U.S. resource plays. In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter stage spacing in our high-GOR oil wells while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million from last year.","In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig, but base production outperformed our expectation supported by 2015 enhanced well completions, all while decreasing production expense per oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation.","Outside the U.S. the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule and we remain on track for first production mid-year. At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts.","On that subject, our thoughts go out to the Fort McMurray community today, where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines have been temporarily suspended to support emergency response efforts.","This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first through the equity offering and second through the successful execution of our non-core asset sale program. In April, we announced $950 million worth of non-core asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year. With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means inclusive of non-core asset sales.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the UK Brae field back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma, four in the STACK, three in the SCOOP and all extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace, and in the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon.","Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering cost, workforce reduction, strengthening the balance sheet and executing non-core asset sales, has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to de-risk our business plan through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are supportive of sustained higher oil prices, and we expect volatility to continue.","As we see strengthening to $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position to be on our front foot when the time comes.","Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips, who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Brae platform in the UK and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last eight years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions and we wish him all the best in his retirement. And Chris is leaving our IR team in good hands so please contact Zach Dailey going forward for all IR related matters.","With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Lee. Before we open the call for questions we'd like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications. And you can re-prompt as time permits. With that, Sylvia, we'll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and let me also add my congratulations to Chris. It's been a pleasure, Chris, and I know we'll keep in touch going forward.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys \u2013 Lee, maybe I can just jump straight into the capital question. You've got a fair amount of non \u2013 I guess, longer-dated capital in 2016. I'm guessing some of that's going to fall away with the completion of some projects. I wonder if you could speak to your capital flexibility beyond that $50 ceiling that you mentioned or level to go to back to work and how things might change as those spending commitments roll away.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Absolutely, Doug and good morning. On the longer cycle investments that we have in 2016 that will be wrapping up, first and foremost is the operated compression project in Equatorial Guinea, which as I mentioned, we are still on track for startup in mid-year. Secondly, of course is our involvement in the non-operated Gunflint project in the Gulf of Mexico, which also will be starting up approximately mid-year. And then, finally, our non-operated participation in the Atrush project in the Kurdistan region. So, those three projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017.","So as you state, that does give us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that of course is targeting the U.S. resource plays, the short cycle investments. And about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio, of which those three long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, conventional exploration space that will have potentially an offset to that. But, largely speaking, those projects will come out and provide us a good deal more flexibility in 2017.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, basically should we anticipate that the $50 number that you mentioned as a kind of a ceiling or sorry, a starting point to go back to work, does that assume that the overall spending level stays the same next year?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well. I think when we talk about the $50 number, Doug, for us, that's really the constructive signal to start increasing our activity, considering reinvestment back into the short cycle investments. And that would be on some type of ramp. I think the capital program for 2017 remains to be developed, but you would expect that we would be directing more than that $1 billion that we had this year toward the short cycle investments in that kind of constructive pricing case.","And, we believe that at that $50 number, Doug, that we would not only have the opportunity to flatten the declines coming out of the resource plays but actually get back on a sequential quarter-on-quarter growth as we get toward the backend of 2017.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you. My follow-up, hopefully a quick one, is just in terms of capital reallocation, your SCOOP\/STACK area appears to be gravitating to the top of the relative priority in terms of capital allocation. Is that a reasonable representation as to where new rigs would go first and if so, where are you in terms of your HBP commitments? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay. I do think that as we do get a more constructive commodity price environment, start looking at that first kind of new dollar of capital allocation, that the Oklahoma Resource Basins, the SCOOP and the STACK are going to compete very strongly for that initial investment when it becomes available. Currently we're running a two rig operated program that in essence covers our HBP requirements.","We're largely held in the SCOOP currently, but most of our leasehold activity is directed at the STACK and of course our Meramec drilling. In fact, two-thirds of the Oklahoma program this year is directed toward the STACK and the Meramec and we would expect that by the time we get to year-end 2016, we should be around 70% HBP-ed with the rig activity that we currently have in place.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, Lee. Thanks again. And congrats again, Chris.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, let me also add my congratulations. Amazing to think the Brae field is still running from all that work you did many years ago. So, congrats.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Ed.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Was that a compliment, Ed?","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. That was definitely meant to be a compliment. So, a couple of quick operational ones. Just obviously, the STACK has emerged as a very competitive play, the over pressured window is becoming more delineated by yourself and peers. You've got some good maps, sort of showing how much acreage you have there, I mean how much sort of in total, net acres would you have in that sort of over pressured window, however you wanted to define it, roughly.","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Ed, great question. This is Lance. I think in general we have a \u2013 from our organic leasing, as well as our historical efforts in the area, we have a large footprint in that. Within the what we view as the core of the Meramec, we see about 90% of our core acreage is underneath or inside that window, that's over pressured from that volatile oil window to down dip. So, a substantial portion of ours is over pressured. Part of the reason we've been growing, developing the lease position is in that area to focus on that over pressured high reservoir energy acreage.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And then just switching to the Eagle Ford. Obviously, you mentioned in the first quarter results that you were seeing some encouraging results and you've given some data, 20% above on offset wells from tighter cluster spacing, the \u2013 stage spacing. The \u2013 any sort of update on EURs for those wells and the completed well cost of $4.3 million also seems quite low. So, maybe just talk a bit about how you manage to get down there?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yes, Ed. So, starting with in the EURs, I think, the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow-on to a group from the previous quarter. So, we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas, as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns on our best acreage, as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest tier of returns, so we started on that, reflecting that, if you'll recall about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window.","We've also had the opportunity now, to move that stage spacing down into the condensate window and although it's early, we're encouraged with the response from the wells; you'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature \u2013 speaking now of the oil wells, over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet, because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that I think it's important to note that we've effectively moved that stage spacing to the basis for all of our oil well completions and continuing to test even down to 150 foot stage spacing today.","And then on top of (14:30) the capital. I think the capital reflects really the focus and the team, they're continuing to drill the wells faster and be efficient and focused on that, they're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We averaged more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies come right to the bottom line are helping to drive those costs down even as we spend more, invest more in the completions. Certainly, overall I think, I'd say that we're still going to need a bit of commercial help, most of these cost changes recently are driven, focused by the efficiency drive within the team.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much. Very clear.","Operator","Next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning guys. And I'd like to add my best wishes to Chris in retirement.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My first question is on the asset monetizations. Your proceeds have already exceeded the high end of your guidance and still in motion. Any new guidance range here or maybe some color on how you arrived at the original guidance and what drove the excess, whether it be risking of the program, more assets sold or better prices?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think we've been, Evan, pretty consistent that non-core asset sales will just be part of what we do as part of our ongoing portfolio management strategy. As such, even though I think, we have been successful in completing the sales against our published target, you should not deem that as us being finished or complete from a non-core asset standpoint. We're not putting out a new target, but certainly, the continued optimization of our portfolio, is just part of what we want to be doing going forward, it's \u2013 when we began that process, we had identified a population of non-core assets, then we considered, did they compete for capital allocation, could they potentially have higher value in someone else's portfolio, that population even on a risk adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target, first target out there at $500 million, and then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark.","So, I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets, and a great example would be Wyoming. There is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools, and I think that's what's created our success this year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Maybe just the same question in a different way. The $1.3 billion sold, can you give me a percentage of what that was in your original guidance?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, I mean what I would say is that we identified well in excess of that original \u2013 of that completed $1.3 billion. And so, there is still room for continued portfolio optimization. For us, it will just be a focus on timing and how do we maximize value to the shareholder from those future transactions.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's fair. Let me ask my second question on the Eagle Ford. And, you cite the ability to drill 97% within 20 feet, maybe just some color where that was a year ago or where you think the industry average is? I'm just \u2013 how that relates to both drilling speed and well performance, as I'm just trying to dimension the impact of that, and where you think that may be going?","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Evan. I think you wouldn't be surprised if we \u2013 I can't articulate it, that that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And that there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent and been able to be focused in that target, and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of experience in the basin, a lot of practice if you will. So, they've gotten very effective at it.","We've been consistently in the mid-90%s in terms of landing a target over time. I think where we look at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years. And, they've still been able to stay within that, even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results. We expect to continue to be able to deliver those results consistently even as the efficiency will still drive upwards.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So, the \u2013 so, I guess both elements are targeted to change, both the percentage that relates more to time and I guess the size, the tightness as it relates to subsequent well performance?","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yes. To some degree but and also keep in mind, over the last two years we've really pioneered the concept of multi-horizon development in south Texas, the Austin Chalk, the Upper Eagle Ford and the Lower Eagle Ford and we're doing all of those. And that percentage reflects landing three different horizons drilled from the same pad in most cases or in more than one of those horizons from every pad in almost every case. So the team's doing a really good job of targeting multi-horizons, very complex trajectories, I think it just demonstrates their efficacy overall.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good stuff. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Hey, good morning and Chris again, congrats. You'll probably hear that many times today.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","You're welcome. Can we go to the STACK and SCOOP and maybe specifically, what is your focus for 2016, obviously you've got some HBP work that needs to be done, but when you step back and look at your asset base, what is your focus. So for 2017, if prices improve and you put some more capital to work, you can be more toward development or maybe even that's too soon for that.","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Scott, this is Lance. I think our focus this year first and foremost is that at lower activity to manage our capital spend, we're going to protect our valuable leasehold in SCOOP and STACK. And second to that, we're going to delineate the phase windows within those two basins. I think there's some key tertiary parameters we're also going to test that'll be important for us this year.","This year we're going to go from six operated wells historically in all of the last two years in STACK, to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half those wells are XLs which gives us a chance to see long lateral performance as well some of the shorter laterals we've had historically. And those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results.","Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year and so all of our wells will be longer laterals, a mile-and-half plus laterals and give us a chance to really test that value of that longer lateral. So I think those are all key objectives that we can accomplish this year, even at lower activity.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, then and just to clarify too, is the plan preparing yourselves for, I don't know if early 2017 is the right timeframe to think about more development once you've figured it out, or do we still have more time of delineating HBP?","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, I think, I was speaking of our operated acreage and we're certainly learning and preparing for full scale development with those activities. But also, we continue to leverage the OBO activity that's material for us in Oklahoma, both in SCOOP and STACK, and that gives us an opportunity this year to participate in some high density tests, some unique multi-horizon tests at scale. And so, we're learning from those and integrating that data just as if we're operating it effectively. And so, I think those things prepare us and help us get ready for that full scale development and to grow the activity.","I think, broadly speaking, in Oklahoma and in the rest of our resource play assets, we've taken this opportunity to work and high-grade our staff over the last year, but also retain capacity to respond to what Lee described. So, as we see that constructive pricing and the opportunity to return to both first flatten and then sequential growth, we've got the core technical staff still in place to do that, doing special projects or other things in the interim so we're ready to respond to that need.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's good clarity. And if I could follow up with the balance sheet looks pretty strong right now with a lot of the work that you all have done. Can you speak to again, if I were to stick on the STACK and SCOOP, do you all think you've got the acreage position appropriate in size relative to Marathon that you need to make this a really core growth engine, or should we expect you all could look at larger bolt-on opportunities? And if you could give some color on what the market's looking for M&A in there right now.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Right. Yeah. This is Lee. I think, absolutely, we feel that Oklahoma is at a scale now where it can be a key growth engine for the future. We've talked about in terms of 100,000 oil equivalent barrel per day producer for us in the future. Having said that, we continue to look for accretive opportunities to grow our core position there. Case in point, Scott, last year, we added something around 12,000 acres in Blaine County and we're going to continue to look for that type of opportunity to expand and more consolidate our position, particularly in the STACK area. We see it, as you look at not only our results as well as the industry results, what you can really say is that the vector is definitely up in the STACK in terms of the well performance, the cost reductions that are being achieved there. So, all of that for us is really just validating our very early perspective on just the potential that the SCOOP and the STACK have.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","From a big picture perspective, you talked on your last call about leverage versus liquidity, and as has been mentioned, you've done a few things here that have improved that leverage. But I wonder if you could just speak to as maybe the thought has come about moving towards ramp-up mode at some point, $50 might be the number, what we should expect and how you would expect to target both leverage and spending within cash flow or outspending and how that may change depending on the commodity environment or if it just doesn't change? Can you just talk about how we should see your strategy in a potentially higher oil price environment than the one that we're in right now?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. First, just maybe to reprise a bit, when we took the decision on the equity raise, that was a risk management decision that allowed us to de-risk our business plans out through 2017. But probably more importantly, beyond strengthening our balance sheet, it also provided us the optionality and the flexibility to be a bit more on the offense, when we do see that constructive price signal.","And we've kind of talked about the $50 or above number, as being that signal, and it has to be a signal that's also equally supported by the fundamentals of supply and demand. It needs to be something that we have confidence in; we know that we're going to be living with some near-term volatility. But we want to have confidence, as we start deploying that first amount of incremental investment. So, we are prepared. Everything we've been doing early this year and actually toward the backend of last year has been geared toward that ramp-up in activity that we can see a case for potentially in 2017. And to the extent that we do see that pricing signal, we're well-prepared, and I think Lance said it well, that we've retained the internal competencies and capabilities that would allow us to get on a good, strong ramp-up in 2017 from an activity standpoint that would get us back very quickly into sequential growth mode.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the willingness to outspend cash flow to do that is there in part, because of the proceeds that have come in?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Absolutely, I think, that it's an independent decision really on just how strongly we would want to go, I think right now, our 2016 objective is definitely living within cash flows inclusive of non-core asset sales. I think as we look at 2017, the reason we've talked about that $50 number is we believe that growth can be achieved there while still living within our means. And that's been a controllable factor. Again, we have a desire to continue to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet over time. So, 2017, again, we'd have very little appetite for outspending in that year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","And we don't see that as a limiting factor.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And, my follow-up is with regards to the Eagle Ford and the well performance that you've seen in the high-GOR area, the 20% outperformance. Can you talk to whether the production mix is the same as your expectations, and how when you layer in the combination of the high-GOR area and condensate drilling, what we should expect for oiliness in the Eagle Ford going forward?","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Brian. I think if you look back over the last several quarters, our overall crude and condensate has drifted down a little bit and I think that's been our focus of the last several quarters, we've been focused on value and I think rightfully so in a challenged commodity market. And in many cases that's been the very high pressure, high deliverability condensate wells. I think as we've lifted the returns and the performance of our oil well set, which is the majority of our future inventory, we have an opportunity to shift that mix back toward the crude oil side a bit. I don't expect it to move very much either way in the future because we have such a large base, but I think as we \u2013 first quarter has been more biased to the oil, we have some subsequent bias to that later in the year in general, we'll see it level out or perhaps trend a bit upward on the oil versus condensate side.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a short term question, and apologies if you dealt with this as much as you want to, but could you talk a little bit more about the situation in Canada for us, Lee, and...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","...sorry, before you start, Chris. Sorry, but congrats and I'll be thinking of you when the big soccer tournament happens this summer, and we have England versus Wales, but more importantly thank you for your help over the years. Sorry, back to Canada, Lee, thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. Obviously, it's a very serious and dynamic situation right now, Paul. It's \u2013 as we've gotten feedback of course from the operator shale, the current situation is that operations are suspended at both mines and that's largely being done to allow folks to focus on rendering aid to the community and emergency response. So very well justified. The mines themselves are not under any direct or immediate threat from the fires themselves but precautions, again, are being taken and it's being watched very closely.","The upgrader is still operating on existing inventory and we have a certain amount of \u2013 a finite amount of inventory there that we can leverage during this outage and really, we're just going to have to wait and see how the situation develops. But rightly so, all the focus right now is on the safety and well-being of the folks in the Fort McMurray community.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, totally understood. So the industry obviously is just turning its attention to the human crisis and \u2013 got it.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Absolutely.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","If I could ask you a strategic question, Lee, to totally change subjects. You talked about and a lot of companies have talked about the flex in short cycle. You mentioned short cycle several times. Is there a scenario for long cycle here? And if there is, what would it be for you? Would it be more Gulf of Mexico deepwater, would it be something else? Would it be more Canadian heavy oil sands? Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. For us, Paul, it really starts with what are the risk adjusted returns that we can generate. And we want our capital allocation, whether it be short cycle or long cycle directed to those projects and opportunities that offer the highest risk adjusted returns. We've been very clear for instance that we're transitioning out of the conventional exploration space, and that's being driven strictly by capital allocation. We simply did not see those opportunities competing in a relative sense within the very opportunity rich portfolio that we have here in the U.S. resource plays.","Now, we still have accretive opportunities that are more mid-cycle and long-cycle, for instance, the compression project that's wrapping up in Equatorial Guinea. But I think as we continue to transition our portfolio, you should expect to see more and more of our capital allocation going toward our very kind of deep and very economic U.S. resource play inventory.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. That's the impression I had. What do you think that the risk is of that, if there is one. I mean, it seems frankly, simply to be the right thing to do.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think, again, going back to that kind of the risk adjusted return, kind of question for me really kind of sets it and when we look within our current portfolio and we see the deep inventory, the $3.6 billion of 2P resources that we have access to, we feel very good about that. And to bring other opportunities in that portfolio, they have to compete within that space in a relative sense. So, we feel very strongly that we're headed in the right direction. It's been a true transformational shift in our company since becoming an independent back in 2011 and we are very encouraged and excited by the progress that we've made.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. If I could just round out. I guess the risk is that everyone tries to grow at the same time. What can you do to mitigate costs? And I know I have asked six questions, so I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","That's okay. We'll give you an out today, Paul. It is a question, when I think about the capacity and execution capacity question, I think of it really in two buckets, Paul. One is the internal capacity and competencies and I think Lance and I both addressed that, that we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. We've done that through redeployment to everything from special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors. So that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally it's a little bit more complicated in that the service sector has been a bit decimated at least on the labor side from this correction.","I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies, will still be in either balance sheet repair or will just simply not have this cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on a very fast ramp. So I do think that the ramp will be self-moderated in some ways ones we get on it. But I think maintaining those strong relationships with our key service providers which we have been able to do during the downturn, that's very important and we're going to leverage those relationships when the kind of the bell rings again to get back into growth mode.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Following question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons.","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning, everybody. And congrats, Chris.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you.","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Lee, you mentioned the objective to flatten declines at $50 and then eventually grow at that price. Can you give us some indications of the latest view with the productivity improvements you're realizing, the cost reductions you're seeing, how many rigs it would take or how much capital relative to current activity levels and CapEx to stabilize that unconventional production portfolio?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Guy. Let me maybe address it this way, when we talk about kind of getting to the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode, you really have to talk about it from a common starting point, where are you starting that discussion. So, if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year. And I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017, based on what we know today and again, this is not a budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource plays in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And, again, that's not just getting us back to flat; that's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017.","So, that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we \u2013 I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies that we're already creating in the business. The Eagle Ford is a great example of that because we're still operating at scale there. And, as we take those efficiencies forward, we expect that that number will even have some downward and constructive pressure on it.","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great detail. And then, I wanted to discuss, we haven't talked about the Bakken much today, but wanted to discuss the resilience of your production there. I'm struck by the fact that production is effectively flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite the meaningful activity reductions. So can you update us on the strength you're seeing in your production rates there? What you're learning in terms of decline rates and really just update us on the outlook and kind of what's driven some of that unforeseen strength, at least on our part?","Lance W. Robertson - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Guy. This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken team's done a really effective job of managing that production, the base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is, as we've had lower activity and they've been very focused on the base business, the production efficiency or uptime is really rising and that's been a focus of theirs, not just the last year, the last couple of years, and they've really improved there.","I think probably more important than that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last year and a half and the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flatten. And so, that group is a big part of driving that flatter profile. Those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial and we continue that.","I think we're \u2013 I would certainly say today, at lower activity we have less opportunity to demonstrate that, but we look forward to the future. There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken and when we get back to activity there, we expect to be able to deliver even better wells in the future than we have in the past just building on that. And I think we even looking forward to say in the second quarter earnings being able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek pad in West Myrmidon, where we'll have pumped our, what we view as our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations to-date in the Bakken. And we expect those results to be compelling.","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great stuff. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel from Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me and this goes back to the labor issue that was discussed a little bit earlier. Given the head count reductions that you've had internally, and of course, your contractors as well, is there a rig count number, or analogously, a CapEx number, that you can say is kind of the peak that you guys could achieve before running into labor availability issues?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. The way I guess I would address that is going back to my earlier comments around what 2017 might look like in a more constructive environment as we get back on a flat and even a sequential increase or growth in the U.S. resource plays, we're sitting today at right around seven rigs across all the resource plays. We've got five rigs running in the Eagle Ford, two rigs running in Oklahoma.","As we think about that kind of notional budget out in 2017 in the resource plays, that $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we talked about, that type of spend in 2017 would likely see us ramping into a rig activity that would probably be close to double where we are today. And so we absolutely have the capacity internally and we feel that the vendor and service community could support it as well, that if that scenario did in fact play out and again, this is not a 2017 budget discussion, but if that scenario did play out, we would comfortably be able to ramp into that level of activity.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, just to clarify, twice your current rig count is the \u2013 what can be realistically achieved, right, without labor pressures?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think what we're saying is that as we look at a reasonable plan under a constructive pricing scenario that's a type of ramp-up that we think would be supportable with all the other constraints that we may have around cash flows, et cetera. And so, yeah, we would be very comfortable \u2013 I wouldn't want to portray that as a peak that we think we would get to, we just think that's a realistic scenario to think about.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","And our final question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just an update on hedging if you could? Thank you.","John R. Sult - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Paul, this is J.R. You've probably seen from the materials that we put out last night that we have increased our hedge book. I think we've done that really for the purpose of protecting at least some level of our cash flows that in turn supports the balance sheet.","When I look at the second half of 2016, we've got now positions in the aggregate of about \u2013 a little bit less than 60,000 barrels a day of crude protection. Those are done through either straight two-way collars or through three-ways. When I look at kind of an average floor price, it's around, call it $49 to $50 average floor price with a sole put on the bottom of that of right around $40. So it gives us \u2013 it does put, again, I think, a floor underneath at least a portion of our production just to give us assurance with regard from a cash flow standpoint. Really nothing at this point in time beyond the 2016 timeframe, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Is the strategy changed and just remind us what the strategy is, I mean how much do you want to be hedged and where are we in that?","John R. Sult - Marathon Oil Corp.","We don't have anything hard and fast, Paul, but I would tell you anything north of say, half of our crude production we would likely not do, at least at this point in time. And so, again, what we're trying to do is at least put some level of support under the cash flows, but still allow our shareholders the opportunity to participate in as much of that upside as possible. Hence, the use of the collars and the three load (44:58).","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Thank you.","John R. Sult - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And the next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sorry to re-prompt here, guys. But, J.R., I wanted to get a comment on the cash flow during the quarter, it was a little bit light versus what we had modeled. Granted, the environment, obviously, exceptionally challenging, but was there anything non-ratable that you might highlight as we think about the outlook for cash flow generation this year?","John R. Sult - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Guy, I'm actually kind of glad you asked. I've seen the brief write-ups early this morning and needless to say, Chris and Zack have been responding to a lot of questions from folks and to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding to, it's really predominately driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reduction in realized prices on a C&C basis about 25% and of course the volumetric implications as well.","But when I then kind of just look at more the micro granular level, there is an item, to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning, the amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter \u2013 the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really \u2013 unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for inter-period tax allocation.","So how we allocate taxes, we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly that, coupled with a couple other non-recurring items likely accounts for close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think, unfortunately when you're always looking at cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try of course, we're managing total cash flow and look at it on an after working capital basis.","And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there, we had some non-qualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our late 2015 workforce reduction and as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior year's incentive compensation payment. And so all of those items actually add together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share.","Guy A. Baber, IV - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. That's very helpful, J.R. Thank you.","John R. Sult - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Chris Phillips.","Christopher C. Phillips - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you Sylvia. Thank you for the kind words at the end of your opening remarks, Lee. I have very much enjoyed interacting with the Street analysts and investors over the last eight years and of course, all of my work colleagues over the last 30 plus years at Marathon Oil. I look forward to following the progress of the company as an investor in my retirement.","With that said, I'd like to thank everyone again for their participation this morning.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Zach Dailey. Mr. Dailey, you may begin.","Zach Dailey","Thanks, Hilda, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Marathon Oil\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Joining me this morning are Lee Tillman, President and CEO; J.R. Sult, Executive Vice President and CFO; Lance Robertson, Vice President, Resource Plays; and Mitch Little, Vice President, Conventional.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Please read our disclosures in our earnings release and in our SEC filings for a discussion of these items. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the quarterly information package on our website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lee","Lee M. Tillman","Thank you, Zach, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll make a few brief comments and open the call for questions. Our second quarter headlines: strong well results, continued cost reductions, successful portfolio management. Our Oklahoma asset team delivered two outstanding STACK Meramec wells with oil cuts above 70% while continuing to balance leasehold demands with acreage delineation.","This same team also closed our PayRock acquisition on Monday, just six weeks after announcing the deal, and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business. The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched toward the accelerated close date. Needless to say, they are excited, and their focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum.","We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken, delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion designs. The Bakken asset team has truly embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for what\u2019s next. They\u2019ve dropped their production costs materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for 2017 capital allocation.","The Eagle Ford continued seeing uplift from tighter stage spacing while feeling the effects of a planned stepdown in activity and challenging base production declines. And despite their move to higher intensity completions, their completed well costs are down significantly year-over-year. Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories.","Rest assured that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams. North America E&P production costs are down almost 30% from a year ago. And we\u2019ve dropped their full year guidance by $1 per oil equivalent barrel. We\u2019ve also reduced 2016 unit production expense guidance for International by $0.50 per oil equivalent barrel. Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses, we\u2019ll deliver a 2016 capital program that\u2019s $100 million below our original budget, all while funding the incremental 2016 activity associated with our STACK acquisition, including the additional rig we\u2019ll add there this quarter. Oklahoma is getting busy. With the acquisition, we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to four rigs in total.","Not to be outdone by North America\u2019s success, in our International business, we achieved first gas from the B3 compression project in EG in July, on schedule and within budget. The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba field\u2019s production plateau by two years and the asset\u2019s life out beyond 2030. As our capital investment in the compression project falls away, EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of high-return opportunities here in the U.S. resource plays.","On the portfolio management side, our non-core asset sales program has now achieved over $1 billion year-to-date. And though we exceeded our initial target, we aren\u2019t done. Expect non-core asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowest-cost, highest-margin opportunities. On the other side of portfolio management, the 61,000 net acres we acquired in the STACK Meramec oil window ticks all the boxes: quality, scale, value, and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price.","Through this volatile and uncertain commodity price environment, we\u2019ve been resolute in executing against our playbook, strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying our portfolio, all with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Zach to begin the Q&A.","Zach Dailey","Thanks. We\u2019ll ask that you guys limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Hilda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","Good morning, a lot of excitement on the STACK. You spoke in the prepared remarks about resuming sequential growth at low to mid $50\u2019s so maybe just some opening remarks about that statement?.","Lee Tillman","Yeah, good morning, Ed. We\u2019re still committed to that, Ed. As we look out at the macro today, though we\u2019re sitting at $40 today, but as we look out to 2017 and see that more constructive pricing, we feel very confident in our ability to begin that growth sequentially again, and do it within cash flows in that low to mid-$50s kind of price range. A lot of that will also hinge on our ability to ensure that we have operational momentum coming out of 2016 as well.","Ed Westlake","And so maybe some color on the rig activity that would be embedded in that. I mean, obviously, we can do our own forecast but just interested in your color on rig ramps and buying Eagle Ford STACK, Bakken...","Lee Tillman","Yeah, absolutely, Ed. We\u2019ve talked about nominally a $1.4 billion program in 2017 that would get us back on that sequential growth track within the resource plays. And within that, the way I would ask you to think about it is, is embedded basically an almost the doubling of the rig count from where we are today to when we would exit in 2017. And that would support both that capital program as well as that volumes profile.","Ed Westlake","All right. Okay. If I could sneak one final one, debt repurchases, or blending and extending maturities, any thoughts there? Other companies are doing the same thing.","J. R. Sult","Hey, Ed. This is J.R. You know, as we\u2019ve talked, I think on previous calls, even though we\u2019re focused here on ultimately being able to get that capital program up to a level to where we can resume the growth path, the balance sheet is still going to be important. I think we\u2019ve got some maturities coming up here in October of 2017 and again in March of 2018.","Sitting here today, it would appear to be the right allocation of capital might be just to wait to be able to pay off those maturities when they\u2019re due. And that\u2019s one reason why I think we\u2019re maintaining the cash balance that we are today, to give us that option. But we\u2019ll continue to look at other opportunities to be able to reduce overall gross debt. But right now, I think we\u2019re leaning toward just repaying those maturities when they\u2019re due.","Ed Westlake","Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","We have a question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Doug.","J. R. Sult","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate","So, guys, as things post your acquisition in the STACK, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of tension going on there. Can you just give us some idea as to how you would prioritize incremental rig additions in the event that the commodity does continue to recover next year?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Yeah, Doug. Good morning. Oklahoma STACK is going to be our absolute first priority, Doug. Once we\u2019ve met our leasehold requirements and our strategic objectives in the STACK, then we\u2019re going to look at optimizing across the remaining basins to maximize economic return. I think the good news there for us is that when we look at that multi-basin optimization, we\u2019ve got a very competitive and diverse Tier 1 inventory that really now features everything from Eagle Ford oil and condensate to Bakken West Myrmidon to SCOOP.","So it\u2019s a great portfolio, but that first incremental capital is absolutely going to Oklahoma STACK. In fact, as we stated in our released material last evening, we\u2019ll be looking to add that second rig into the STACK acquisition acreage later in the third quarter, bringing us to a total of four rigs in Oklahoma.","Doug Leggate","As a follow-up, obviously, the STACK\u2019s a fairly meaningful change in your inventory where you\u2019ve got \u2013 how would you characterize your comfort level or your satisfaction, I guess is a better way of putting it, with your current acreage position up there because, obviously, relative to some of your other peers, you still have a relatively a small footprint. Do you see other additions in the future? Or what\u2019s the overall characterization of availability of acreage? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yep. Well, thank you. Yeah, Doug, I certainly wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m very happy with our footprint in the STACK as well as the SCOOP, as certainly with the bolt-on of the STACK acquisition, the PayRock acquisition, it enhanced our position materially in the STACK. But as I look across it from a overall resource standpoint and you think about the fact that we now have in excess of about $1 billion 2P resource in the STACK as well as another $1 billion or so in the SCOOP, that is a very, very material position going forward in Oklahoma. And at just over 200,000 net surface acres in the STACK, we feel very good about our position. We would never forego accretive small bolt-on positions or greenfield leasing, but we\u2019re quite pleased with where we stand right now in Oklahoma.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answers, Lee. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We have a question from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe with the PayRock deal closed, can you talk a little bit plans to integrate these assets? I mean, I guess you\u2019ve talked about rig addition there, but generally how you characterize that acreage relative to your legacy acreage and potential improvements or any changes operationally that you might look to make on things like lateral length or completions or such versus what you\u2019ve done on your acreage?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Let me maybe kick that one off, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Lance to maybe provide a bit more color. But we just closed on the STACK acquisition on Monday and took over operations after lunch on Monday, so integration is still a work in progress, though the team is well advanced. As you mentioned, we\u2019re going to be putting a second rig to work there. The two rigs are going to be initially focused on protecting that valuable leasehold, but also looking toward continuing strategic, I\u2019ll say, delineation around the play as well.","But in terms of economics and where those wells fall in our set of opportunities, there\u2019s no doubt that the STACK oil opportunities compete at the very top of our Tier 1 inventory. And that\u2019s even been confirmed yet again with the three additional wells that have been brought to sales within the acquisition between, up to close. And so maybe I\u2019ll just let Lance fill in a few more details on just how the integration is going?","Lance Robertson","Sure. Thanks, Lee. We took over the operations Monday. It\u2019s been very seamless to date. Obviously, we look at the acquired acres. They\u2019re on the oil bias side. We think it balances the portfolio across the breadth of the STACK basin very nicely for us. We\u2019re going to have the ongoing obligations there to defend the lease position. And our heritage Marathon acreage in STACK as well is ongoing in the acquired acres. We do have a bit of excess capacity there.","I think one of the things that you had recognized in our activities to date, so for example, in the results we reported this quarter, we\u2019ve been transitioning to XL wells in our over-pressured area to look at the value there. Those well results have been very compelling, and we\u2019re very excited about those. We also purchased this acquisition on the oil bias side based on the fact that they had among the very best productivity on a lateral-adjusted foot basis with very low capital costs, which together create a great value opportunity for us.","And so we\u2019re going to continue on that basis. But I think we also recognize the opportunity with about half the acres in the acquired package suitable for XL that we\u2019re going to move to also test the XL in that area to see what the best long-term result for Marathon is.","Ryan Todd","How much of your acreage across the entire, not just the acquired acreage but across your entire STACK portfolio now is conducive to long laterals?","Lance Robertson","I think in general about half of that\u2019s conducive to long laterals, perhaps a bit more as we continue to consolidate and unitize in there. But that\u2019s where we\u2019d stand today.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","We have a question from Guy Baber from Simmons.","Guy Baber","Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody.","Lee Tillman","Morning, Guy.","Guy Baber","I\u2019m just trying to understand the financial and operational framework you\u2019ve set out here for 2017. So I had a follow-up there. But I believe you mentioned the early view is that about $1.4 billion in spending or so next year would be sufficient to return the company to sequential growth, assuming oil in the mid to low $50s. I believe you also mentioned the desire to live within cash flow. So is $1.4 billion, plus your dividend, about the type of cash flow you expect to generate next year in a low to mid-$50 world? Or are you incorporating some asset sales proceeds into your forecast to support that as well?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Guy, thanks for the follow-up question. First of all, I want to be very clear the $1.4 billion I\u2019m talking about, Guy, is for the resource play element only. That would not include other capital requirements and the conventional elements of our business, although we would expect similar to what we did this year that the bulk of our capital investment in 2017 will, in fact, be allocated to the resource plays.","But in that low $50 to mid-$50 window we would absolutely expect to cover that capital demand within operating cash flows. Does not mean that we\u2019re not still pursuing non-core asset divestitures, but we\u2019re certainly not saying we\u2019re going to be reliant upon those. They give us optionality but we don\u2019t feel that we need to rely on those if we\u2019re in that price band.","Guy Baber","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up is, understanding 2017 is something of a transitional year for you during which you attempt to return the company back to sequential growth, but once you get a better commodity price environment, you\u2019ve improved the well results, the operational performance I think significantly. You\u2019ve also made meaningful improvements to the portfolio and your opportunity set. When the time comes, what type of growth rate do you think Marathon is poised to fundamentally deliver longer term? Just trying to understand that framework for longer term growth?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, no, absolutely. I think first and foremost, you said it well, we\u2019ve got this great opportunity set that very much competes for capital and the price band. A lot of that I would say growth aspiration, though, will be highly dependent upon the pricing that we see. Being a very oil levered company, of course we have a very strong response in operating cash flows as we see improvement to the oil price. So to the extent that we need to modulate between growth as well as generating free cash flows, we\u2019re prepared to do that. But the potential that we\u2019ve got in the three resource plays definitely provides us an avenue for moving to a very competitive growth metric in the future. Without getting into specifics there, we have that potential.","Guy Baber","Thank you very much.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","We have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Good morning, guys.","Lance Robertson","Hey, Evan.","Lee Tillman","Morning, Evan.","Evan Calio","My first question, your Meramec, your legacy wells are performing better than your type curve. How large of a well sample of production history do you need to raise your resource estimate? I guess the same question applies to Eagle Ford with the 200-stage spacing and Bakken wells with larger completion. I know the last time you lifted your resource estimate was September. How are you guys thinking about that?","Lance Robertson","Sure, Evan. This is Lance. So I\u2019ll start kind of in the order you asked them, perhaps, but overall it\u2019s clearly early in the STACK still. I mean we\u2019re delineating the whole acreage, us and peers. Those well results we reported this quarter, the Irven John and the Olive June are excellent well results. They\u2019re XL wells. They\u2019re performing above that type curve. They\u2019re also only about 40 days or 50 days into their total production. So I think we\u2019re going to need to let those run a while. I think we\u2019re excited that they\u2019re above that curve, and so there\u2019s certainly an opportunity for resource upgrade.","We\u2019ll also have, as you might recall, a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from our heritage acreage we\u2019ll get to talk about. So when we get the breadth of those, and they\u2019ve matured a bit would be a bit more appropriate time for that.","Turning to the Bakken, I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter. All off of the same pad, among the three best wells put in the basin in the last three years. That really demonstrates what technology application, the right landings on the right combination is. And we have inventory like that. Similarly, we\u2019d like to see those mature. But there are other wells in that area that also perform well, which is why we were aggressive in that area. So I think we need to let those mature. But I\u2019d just echo your point. There\u2019s clearly opportunity for a resource upgrade there, driven by that.","Lastly, Eagle Ford. We continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter stage spacing, particularly in the oil areas in the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford. Responding very well. We\u2019ve got a breadth of wells there now, almost 75 wells in that group. So it\u2019s maturing, which gives us more confidence. And I think we recognize there\u2019ll be a need to do a resource update in the not too distant future.","Evan Calio","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I could follow up in the Eagle Ford. I know you upspaced your Austin Chalk assumptions to 80 acre spacing. Could you walk us through what drove that change? And is that because you were getting well interference at the 40 acre spacing? I guess, are you planning on draining the Austin Chalk with your Upper Eagle Ford laterals?","Lance Robertson","Yes, Evan. So I think we went last year from unconstrained Austin Chalk very quickly to 40-acre spacing in the Austin Chalk to try to find the bounds of productivity of that reservoir. I think what we\u2019ve discovered over the last few quarters is that at 40-acre spacing when we\u2019ve had groups, really our first groups of Austin Chalk wells together that are constrained, that the reservoir quality is very high. It\u2019s got a lot of natural fracturing, which we suspected but weren\u2019t certain of. And those wells are communicating laterally a bit and that overall we\u2019re going to get the best capital efficiency in the Austin Chalk at wider spacing.","In that same timeframe, we\u2019ve also been testing the Upper Eagle Ford, really doubled the amount of our delineated acreage over that time in the Upper Eagle Ford and recognized that we could backfill some of those Austin Chalk locations with Upper Eagle Ford, but both at wider spacing. They just interact better. Ultimately, we\u2019re looking for the highest recovery of hydrocarbon out of that unit at the lowest capital input. So we\u2019re trying to optimize the returns at the drilling unit level.","Evan Calio","Is there a reasonable oil price in which you\u2019d go back to the 40-acre downspacing? Or how does that interplay work?","Lance Robertson","Sure. I think you have to take a view on price, any of this, and I would reflect that we started this density testing at north of $90 a barrel. Probably looks different at $40. So the higher commodity price, I think the more you\u2019d want to look at that ultimate density because that just drives the returns from that unit. We think where we are today, evolving, making these adjustments is appropriate for today\u2019s commodity market.","Evan Calio","Great. Good stuff. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We have a question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Lee Tillman","Hey, Brian. Good morning.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow up on the CapEx, $1.4 billion. I think you clarified on the earlier question that this is for the key resource areas, and just wanted to kind of put that into context to make sure the base is right. Is this essentially off of about a $375 million spent for those resource plays in the first half of the year? And then can you talk about the trajectory for how you\u2019re thinking about the rest of the company? I think if we look at least on a cash flow statement type perspective, you spent about $800 million overall for the company in the first half.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Certainly, in the first half of the year, Brian, there was a bit of a bias because we had a couple of long-cycle projects that were running their course that are now, of course, both started up, which are the EG compression project as well as the non-operated Gunflint project. So there was probably a bit more bias to the conventional portfolio in the first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of the year, that\u2019s going to largely be paced by the resource plays themselves, and that will really set the, I\u2019ll say, kind of that exit velocity that we achieve from a capital program standpoint as we move out of the year.","We do anticipate, based on the activity we\u2019ve described, including the additional rig in Oklahoma, as well as some additional completion work in the Eagle Ford, that we will exit the fourth quarter with some pretty strong momentum going into 2017. To your point, I guess, on the rest of the portfolio, the looking forward to 2017, you should expect us to continue to minimize the capital allocation to the conventional program, very similar to what we endeavoured to do this cycle in 2016.","Brian Singer","Great. Thanks. And then, as a little bit of a follow-up, from more of a strategic perspective, which is given your, I think, interest in the return that you\u2019re seeing from the resource play portfolio, how strategically are you thinking about the assets elsewhere? Do you anticipate additional asset sales or, as you perhaps just described, minimal levels of capital investment, try to use these assets for the free cash flow to offset potential outspending going on at the resource plays?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, Brian, our conventional business is absolutely geared toward generating free cash flow that can then be redeployed. That\u2019s the model, that\u2019s what Mitch drives the team toward. I will look at some selective investments there. Great example is the EG compression project, albeit a long cycle project it\u2019s very accretive, it\u2019s delivering very strong economics and performance in the portfolio and it\u2019s simply going to add to the ability of Equatorial Guinea to add to our cash flows.","I think a separate question, though, is more of the non-core asset question. We continue to scrutinize our portfolio and ensure that it is fully optimized. As I said in my opening remarks, we\u2019ve achieved $1 billion year-to-date of non-core asset divestitures but we believe there is more work to be done there. We don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be to the scale of, say, a Wyoming, but we still believe there\u2019s some good solid portfolio work, particularly here in North America, that we continue to drive. And again, it\u2019s all focused on that simplification and concentration of the portfolio toward the highest risk-adjusted returns.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Hi, guys.","Lee Tillman","Hey, Paul, good morning.","Paul Sankey","Good morning. A high level question, if I could. I assume that you\u2019re basically planning the company at about a $50 outlook. How would things change if we were to start assuming $40 or $60, in your mind? And I know you\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant, probably quite rightly, to commit to levels of prices at which you\u2019d start to think about faster growth and stuff, but I\u2019m trying to pin you down on it. Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Paul, I appreciate your transparency. I\u2019ll maybe take those two bookends that you just talked about, the $40 and the $60. Obviously I think at $40, similar to what we\u2019ve experienced this year, we\u2019d be looking to protect our balance sheet, to ensure that though we continue to drive those leasehold and strategic objectives in the portfolio, and then look with great discipline at some of those discretionary economic opportunities within the portfolio. We\u2019d still be bearing down on cost, we\u2019d still be bearing down on non-core asset sales. So those would be the behaviors and the objectives if we saw an environment moving into 2017 that is more in the [ph] 4- handle range.","I think, conversely, if we see more constructive pricing moving into 2017 at that $60, as we\u2019ve talked about, a $10 move in pricing for us is a big impact on our operating cash flows. And we\u2019d be looking to redeploy those pretty strongly back here into the U.S. resource place to not only get back on sequential growth, but to get on that growth quite strongly if we saw that level of price support. We\u2019ve protected the organization in such a way that we have the capacity to move to much higher activity levels. And if we saw that $60, we\u2019d move toward that as quickly as we could.","Paul Sankey","That\u2019s interesting. So on the dividend, is that still something that you aspire to return to be relatively a high dividend payer Or do you see yourself shifting as to a more of a unconventional growth story?","Lee Tillman","I think as you look at our portfolio, Paul, you look at our business model, we have made the shift. We made the shift in the dividend last year. Of course it was helpful from an operating cash flow standpoint, but it was also much more consistent with where we were headed in this very short-cycle investment, resource-play-intensive business that we\u2019re in. And we think from a competitive standpoint, given our opportunity outlook for growth and reinvestment, that\u2019s the right place for us to place our shareholder money.","Paul Sankey","Great. Thanks. And if I could just try one to Lance. Lance, we\u2019ve seen something very interesting here, which is that obviously there\u2019s been a significant improvement in cost performance, really across the industry, at lower prices. But what\u2019s also interesting is I guess the technical improvements are still being achieved even though activity is so much lower. If we did go back to higher prices, do you think technical improvements would accelerate, or would they actually deteriorate because we\u2019d be going into presumably into less high quality acreage?","Lance Robertson","Yeah, Paul, I think that\u2019s an insightful question. I think what we would focus on at today\u2019s activity, which we are, or at higher activity in the future would be in our Tier 1 inventory. As we\u2019ve taken those technical advances, and we\u2019ve lifted up the returns of some of our portfolio, we have such a breadth of it now that we\u2019re going to focus within that Tier 1 first. We\u2019ll take a portion of our activity to try to test some Tier 2 and lift it up to meet that thing. We need to stay disciplined in any price environment to make sure we\u2019re bringing our best opportunities forward, but also taking the view that we\u2019re going to bet on technology, we\u2019re going to bet on the innovation and the creativity of our people to keep bringing our portfolio up accretively over that time.","Paul Sankey","Yeah. Could I just ask a follow-up? You said that you\u2019ve retained \u2013 is it that you haven\u2019t restructured people? Or how have you retained your ability that both of you mentioned?","Lance Robertson","Yeah. Sure. As we spun down our activity, we recognized that we have a cadre of early career talented people. And we don\u2019t necessarily have the direct activity to put them into. So we\u2019ve taken them out to special projects across the company. They\u2019re out doing site supervision work on rigs and frac crews, production supervisors. So we\u2019re retaining them in very valuable functions, maturing their leadership and their technical skills and their business acumen. And then as we grow activity, we can recall them into other petro-technical-focused roles. And they\u2019re going to be even better prepared to take those on. So that early activity ramp, those people are here for us.","Paul Sankey","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Yeah. Hey, guys. Maybe I can ask you to force rank your Bakken and Eagle Ford opportunities. So you\u2019ve been very clear, SCOOP and STACK will be the first call on capital. Which one goes second?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. This is Lee. Just for clarity. At the top of our batting order is going to be STACK oil. That clearly has the superior returns, whether we look at a $40 environment, or even a $50 environment. I think then the lead table gets pretty interesting. Because of all the good work the asset teams have been doing, we actually have more diversity within our tier one inventory that will compete for capital. But the ones that we would see really rising to the top are, we\u2019re going to continue to see Eagle Ford high GOR oil. We\u2019re going to continue to see Bakken, West Myrmidon specifically, come in to the mix. And then also the SCOOP condensate area is going to be a strong performer which will also maybe amplified in the event that we see stronger gas support as well. So that\u2019s really the lead table as we see it today.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then just a point of clarification on the small drop in your full-year production guidance, is that purely the net effect of taking out Wyoming and putting in the new STACK acreage?","Lee Tillman","That\u2019s an element of it. But there is also an element, of course, of just base decline and other elements for our business, specifically Eagle Ford, which we\u2019ve already talked about.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. So it\u2019s all in. All right. Thanks, guys.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us your outlook or expectations for how the U.S. resource play production could trend in the back half of the year? And secondly, is there going to be some more knock-on effect from the Eagle Ford completions, the high density completions you highlighted in 2015 in the update?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I\u2019ll take maybe the question around the back half of the year on resource plays. And then maybe pitch it over to Lance to take on if there\u2019s any knock-on effect of the completion discussion. I think you\u2019ve seen the releases that have come out over the last few days. There\u2019s clearly more optimism in the market, particularly I think as you stretch into 2017. I think the sector in general is struggling with striking the correct balance between wanting to be prepared if they get a strong and sustainable price signal versus getting too far ahead of their headlights and losing, I think, the discipline that has been required during this downturn.","So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective, we do expect to build some momentum going in to the fourth quarter which we thing would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing. And I would say that there\u2019s probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same. There, of course, will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity. But I don\u2019t see a dramatic adjustment, just because the declines have been pretty challenging this year. And it\u2019s going to be hard, of course, to offset that completely with late-year activity. And maybe, Lance, if you want to chime in on just the question around the knock-on and the completion effects?","Lance Robertson","Sure. So specifically focusing on the Eagle Ford, I think as Lee referenced, our guidance takes into account our view on all that. So it\u2019s there in it. We have made some adjustments to the development plan. You\u2019ll see those reflected in the Eagle Ford second half of the year. Shift to focus [ph] on more, two-thirds of that activity is in the high GOR oil areas which are our highest value type curves at current pricing. And we have widened out that Austin Chalk from 40-acre to 80-acre spacing to mitigate those influences. And the three and four zone high density pads are really, we\u2019re foregoing those for the rest of this year. And so that will help mitigate those concerns. Otherwise we\u2019ve put into our guidance what we think the base decline from 2015\u2019s going to look like.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And my follow-up. Just, Lee, in terms of your comments of, earlier in the call about doubling maybe the rig count between now and year-end 2017 in order to get to that, let\u2019s call it, flattish with some growth in the U.S. resource plays. Would you anticipate a stair-step kind of linear kind of move in activity over that time period?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. There will certainly be a ramp associated with that. I mean, I mean that would not be a step change, if you will. There would be a ramp across the year. So I was trying to just kind of project out kind of where we thought we might exit out of 2017 based on that nominal $1.4 billion type investment. But there will absolutely be a ramp.","And I think, too, you have to bear in mind, that the rigs today are doing a lot more than the rigs did a year ago. And so, we absolutely are taking advantage of that efficiency. In fact, in the Eagle Ford we\u2019ve actually gone down a rig since second quarter, from five to four rigs, recognizing just the sheer efficiency of our drilling operations and the ability of our teams to continue to set a very strong pace on the drilling side of the business.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee M. Tillman","Yeah. Well, I would just like to thank everyone on the call for their questions and certainly their interest in Marathon Oil. It\u2019s been a busy and productive quarter for the company. I think the headlines speak for themselves. I won\u2019t go back through those. But we are preparing for that sustainable price environment where we can profitably grow our business within cash flows. In 2017, we can get our business back to sequential growth and live within our means with WTI in the low to mid-$50s. And as I\u2019ve stated during the call, we have the potential for even higher growth at higher pricing with an industry-leading leverage to oil.","So thank you again for the time on the call. I appreciate it and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Zach Dailey. Mr. Dailey, you may begin.","Zach Dailey - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Hilda. Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil's third quarter 2017 conference call. I'm Zach Dailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Also joining me this morning are Lee Tillman, President and CEO; Mitch Little, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dane Whitehead, Executive Vice President and CFO.

Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. First, congratulations to my hometown Astros in their victory in what can only be described as a historic World Series. Houston needed a win with all of its recent challenges, and the Astros delivered. Go 'Stros. Hopefully, there's no Dodgers fans on the call.","I'll share a few opening remarks, and then we'll spend the bulk of the time addressing your questions. All year, we've consistently executed across our portfolio, delivering outstanding new well productivity, strong base performance, cost reductions and improved efficiencies. We continued this trend in the third quarter, delivering 14% sequential oil growth in the resource plays that drove us to exceed the top-end of our U.S. production guidance range, while achieving record low unit production costs in the U.S.","We now expect to end the year toward the high-end of our updated 2017 production guidance range, which is complemented by an increased exit rate guidance in the resource plays, all while living within our means at current strip pricing. This highlights the strength of our transformed portfolio and sets the stage for 2018, as we integrate the same discipline into our ongoing budget efforts. At a basin level, our execution focus translated into outstanding third quarter results across the company.","Eagle Ford production was up from Q2 despite the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Kudos to some great work by our team to swiftly, efficiently and safely respond to what was a devastating storm on so many levels. Through three quarters of the year, Eagle Ford's 90-day cumulative well production is tracking 15% above last year's, while maintaining flat completed well cost and working to uplift the economic viability of our inventory outside of our core Karnes County position.","Bakken production grew 20% from Q2, and this year's program is performing even above the step-change improvement we saw in 2016. The five Hector wells we brought online during the quarter delivered 30-day rate averaging 2,400 boe per day, beginning to put their productivity on par with our Myrmidon area.","Our team set a Williston Basin record for the highest IP 30 oil rate with the Clarice Middle Bakken well in Hector at 2,785 barrels of oil per day. Consistent with our plan to extend this success, the next Hector pad is much farther to the East and 24-hour test rates from the first two wells were 5,900 and 2,650 boe per day.","Oklahoma grew 18% from Q2, and our STACK volatile oil wells continue to outperform expectations. We also completed an Osage well in Kingfisher County with encouraging early results. Our Oklahoma program remains focused on leasehold, delineation and infill pilot testing, as we continue to integrate data, technology and optimize completion designs on a customized basis across the STACK and SCOOP with an objective of achieving the highest full-section returns.","In our newest basin, we continue to ramp up activity in the Northern Delaware with five wells to sales, including two very good Wolfcamp X-Y results in Eddy County. We have also transitioned to a dedicated frac crew and recently added a fourth rig. Production at Equatorial Guinea grew 5% sequentially and generated over $180 million of EBITDAX in Q3. The cash flow generation capability from this world-class asset continues to support our overall strategy of delivering profitable growth within cash flows.","As I mentioned at the outset, we now expect to be cash flow neutral in 2017 at current strip prices, including dividend and changes in working capital. While it's too early to talk about 2018 budget specifics, our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We will continue to support targeted strategic objectives associated with lease protection, delineation and infill pilots, but expect to deliver a returns-focused program, while living within our means at a moderate oil price of around $50 WTI.","Along those lines, we have listened closely to investor feedback and have continuous dialogue on the metrics that matter with our Compensation Committee, and we fully expect to integrate both the returns-based metric and a per share metric into our compensation structure. These changes are consistent with others we've made since I became CEO four years ago, and we'll continue our journey to enhance alignment between management incentives and long-term value creation.","Production growth will be an outcome of our capital allocation to the highest risk-adjusted returns, and you should expect about 95% to flow to the U.S. resource plays. This will drive margin expansion, as we further shift our production mix to align with our investment focus. With an abundance of high-return investment opportunities in each basin, these choices will be informed by the extensive 2017 performance data across our portfolio.","For example, the exceptional Bakken results, particularly in the Hector area, continued profitable extension of Eagle Ford into areas outside of core Karnes County, and the anticipated step-up in activity in Northern Delaware will all compete within our four-basin optimization. All of this sends the clear signal that competition for our discretionary CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it ever has been.","You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic real-time effort as we continually optimize across our four basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment. Our drive for maximizing returns is neither static nor limited to an annual budget cycle. Underpinning our strategy and outlook is a continued focus on a strong balance sheet. The actions we took in the third quarter, reducing gross debt by $765 million, lowering interest expense by about $65 million, managing our maturity profile are fully consistent with this priority.","With both cash on hand and anticipated strong operating cash flows, you should expect us to continue focusing on reducing gross debt, as well as looking to pursue low entry cost opportunities within our resource play exploration group, opportunistically acquire small acreage packages in our core basins, fund our high-return organic investment program and support our dividend. And just as a reminder, we will receive the second OSM installment of $750 million in first quarter of 2018.","All the work we've done the last couple of years around the balance sheet, cost reductions and portfolio transformation have all been done to position Marathon Oil to deliver profitable growth within cash flows at moderate oil pricing. That is our investment case. And thanks to recent performance in cost efficiencies, we believe we can achieve that objective at a flat $50 WTI. We have moved from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the four highest-margin, lowest-cost U.S resource plays.","We expect our margins to expand, as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. The margin expansion story, coupled with outstanding financial flexibility, will drive cash flow growth per debt adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2017 and beyond. I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset every quarter.","Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have a question from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good morning and great quarter. Maybe if I could start with one on capital allocation into 2018. I know you can't provide specifics and you mentioned the overriding philosophy is spending within cash flow. But is the target, as we think about capital next year, to target a budget that's effectively in line, including the dividend, with operating cash flow at around $50? And then, if oil price were to be higher than budgeted, how would you prioritize the use of excess cash and where in the \u2013 I guess in the potential uses would cash return to shareholders fit in the list of potential uses there over the medium term?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay. Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, Ryan. This is Lee. You're right, our production growth is absolutely going to be an outcome of capital allocation to the best risk-adjusted returns, and we're going to do that while living within our means. And that means basically balancing our capital and our dividends with our operating cash flow. And we're currently basing that on about a $50 flat WTI forward pricing.","In the event that we see more price support and see better and improved free cash flow above and beyond cash flow neutrality, then again, it's going to come back to those high-level priorities, starting with making sure that we protect and support an investment-grade balance sheet through continued gross debt reduction. We want to make sure that we've got ample liquidity to protect our flexibility and certainly respond to any volatility in the market. We're going to fund our high-return organic investment.","Certainly, from a cash return to shareholders, we're going to continue to support our dividend as well. And then, we're also going to continue to look for opportunities for resource capture via our low entry cost opportunities within our resource exploration team, as well as some smaller bolt-on acquisitions, where we continue to want to build more of a contiguous position in some of our core basins. So, that's really where we would stand, Ryan, if we see some more discretionary cash flow on hand next year.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And I guess maybe as a follow-up to that, post the $750 million in proceeds from the second installment in OSM that you'll get in the first quarter of next year, it'll leave you with a pretty significant cash balance. Can you talk about how you think about managing that longer term? You mentioned gross debt pay-down. Should we expect to see you continue to pay down debt in advance of the scheduled maturities or how would you think, I guess, about managing that cash balance longer term?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. We're always scrutinizing our capital structure and ways to improve that. Directionally, our objective is to continue to reduce gross debt. That is an objective that we have. We're not prepared to get into the specifics around that today, what that might look like. But directionally, that's something that we're pursuing. We hope to leverage again some of the elements of our existing capital structure to facilitate that, and I would just say stay tuned.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is there a targeted range about where we should expect \u2013 where you'd like your leverage to be?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","I think as we look out toward next years, particularly on kind of the cash metrics, debt to EBITDA, Ryan, certainly, we would like to get below that kind of 2.0 mark and get comfortably below that. Obviously, we're very mindful as well of wanting to make sure that we protect our investment-grade rating. We're there with two of the three agencies. One of the three, obviously, took a sector position that the sector is still a little bit in the penalty box on. But we think that investment-grade rating is important in terms of the flexibility and the cost of capital that it provides.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Ryan. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have a question from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to the Astros as well.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Guy. Appreciate it. As you might imagine, there's a few tired folks in Houston today.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Right, I'm one of them. So, just to lead us off here, the production has outperformed this year obviously, while capital spending has been lower than expected. So, the capital efficiency just appears to be improving pretty meaningfully. So, if we did a look back analysis here, if you compare kind of where you are now, where you see the capital efficiency and how that compared to internal expectations entering the year, can you just touch on maybe the specific areas where you're really coming out ahead of plan that you would call out? From our vantage point, it appears the performance is pretty broad-based, but I know you guys have done that work. So, just trying to better understand if there are specific areas you would really highlight as big outperformers relative to internal plan.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think the way I would characterize it, Guy, is first of all, it's a combination of factors like on all these cases. First, we've seen very strong performance from the base production that we carried in from 2016. So, we've seen a strong support from those carry-in barrels from the capital program last year. Secondly, our new well productivity has been higher than originally anticipated when we pulled together the plan. Thirdly, I think the teams have done an outstanding job of finding ways to embed efficiencies that have allowed us to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we saw much earlier in the year when we kind of went through a little bit of hyperinflation during the initial rig ramp-up.","So, I think it's a combination of all of those things. And I think importantly, we saw some kind of, I'll call them, breakout performances in some areas that quite frankly when we built the plan, we couldn't fully anticipate. We had to kind of risk those. And specifically, I would cite, certainly, the Bakken, both Myrmidon and Hector, just the continued outperformance we've seen there. The extension in the Eagle Ford outside of the core Karnes County area and the ability there obviously to keep completed well cost essentially flat over the period, despite inflationary pressures and even more intense completion designs. The volatile oil performance not only in new wells, but the base that we carried in, in Oklahoma, all of those things collectively, I believe, have contributed to the shift in our capital efficiency, which we're very, very proud of, in the second half of the year.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","That's very helpful. And then, Lee, you touched on this in the comments, but I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on the potential revision to the compensation metrics, really what you're trying to achieve there and what your organization and you all believe the best metrics are to judge real value creation. And then, perhaps just remind us how those metrics maybe have already evolved over the course of your tenure at Marathon.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. You're right, it has been a bit of an evolution, Guy. We have been focused on the metrics that matter with our Compensation Committee really since day one. It's been something that we consider each and every cycle, and in fact, we've shown, I think, a great amount of willingness to actually make changes and make improvements to that. So, when you think about our structure today, I would say we're very happy that we do have a very strong alignment and strong linkage to pay-for-performance.","In other words, I'm not in any way saying that our current structure is broken. But we do use a variety of metrics to run our business, and not surprisingly, we need to use a variety of metrics to also drive our compensation. We don't want to get overly reliant on any one metric. And so, we keep a lot of flexibility around our metrics, the weightings of those metrics. We've even made changes in our proxy peer group to better reflect the changes that we've made in our company.","And so, I think we have shown a history of continuing to search for ways to incentivize our leaders that encourage that long-term value creation mindset. And I think this most recent dialogue around returns and per share metrics is a healthy one. It's one that we've had internally as well, and we will be featuring aspects of both of those as part of our forward compensation structure.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Evan.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Evan.","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Lee. It appears all your unconventional basins are competing for capital here, as are individual focus areas within the basins. I know you have strategic priorities in terms of holding and testing PayRock and Delaware acreage in 2018. But could you walk us through the 2018 strategic priorities and then the broad rank of basins where incremental CapEx dollars could flow?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, first of all, what I would say, Evan, is that we're still in the process of fully integrating 2017 performance data into our capital allocation optimization. Much of the data of course that we're sharing in the third quarter, we're still building in to our forward-look. And as we go through our, I'll call it, four-basin optimization, we want to make sure that we're using the absolute best, not only technical data and productivity data, but also cost data, so that our decisions are driven by a return focus, and that's really within that, I'll call it, discretionary bucket.","The strategic objectives really are pretty consistent with the ones that we talked about for 2017, and they really revolve around in those limited areas now, which are the STACK and Northern Delaware, where we have leasehold requirements. Those, of course, will be at the very top of that list. The continued work on delineation in both the STACK as well as the Northern Delaware, and then finally, the infill pilot work that is ongoing really not only in the STACK, but even starting in the fourth quarter in Northern Delaware. Those, in my opinion, are really that element of our program that's strategic in nature that we want to drive, because that's really setting the tone and the cadence for the business in the future.","Within the discretionary program, it's going to be all based on where we believe we can generate those highest risk-adjusted returns, and that's where the integration of a lot of this new data is going to be essential and vitally important, so that we make the correct calls on that development program, if you will. And you're right, all four basins are competing very strongly. That's a great problem to have, to have that type and level of opportunities. And that work really is what we're doing currently. And more to be revealed clearly next year, where we'll get into basin-by-basin capital allocation.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Maybe a follow-up there. In the Bakken, your Hector results have been excellent, you disclosed there last night. And while early, your well inventory appears much deeper than it was six months ago. And so, does that change the amount of capital you can deploy there or more generally transform it from a run it flat to a growth \u2013 or run it to a driver of significant growth region? So, i.e., run it flat for cash flow or a driver of significant growth in the future?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think it changes everything. I think the ability to continue to migrate inventory towards our internal Tier 1 kind of criteria, it does. It changes our view of Bakken. And earlier this year, that was really yet to be proven. I think with the continued success in both the Myrmidon, and now as we have marched across the Hector area, we continue to de-risk and prove up more of that top-tier inventory in the Bakken, which I do believe means it's going to compete more strongly for capital and certainly has the ability to grow as it's demonstrating this year. And just this quarter, we had exceptional growth in the Bakken from these highly capital-efficient wells that we put down.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","So, its role is going to change.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Congratulation on the results and the Astros, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have a question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Lee. Good morning, everybody.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A follow-up to Evan's question, Lee. I think in the past, you've kind of walked us away from assuming that the Southern part of your Bakken acreage was being de-risked by these tremendous wells you've got in the Hector area. Can you kind of give us an update as to what proportion of that acreage you now believe is de-risked? And maybe to get then through an addendum to that, when you look at your other options, it would seem to us with those oil rates that the returns here are probably some of the best in your portfolio. Would that be a fair way of thinking about relative capital allocation for next year? I've got a follow-up, please.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. What I would say, Doug, is that although we're really encouraged with the Hector results, we still have a limited number of pads. We did this \u2013 we shared some 24-hour IPs from this Far Eastern pad and that really stepped us across the play, but we still have some work to do in between kind of where we know we have good well control, which is where the initial pads were. Also, we still need to kind of test that further to the South as well, not just to the East.","So, there's still some work left to do, but we do believe that we're beginning to migrate a material amount of the Hector inventory toward Tier 1. So, I don't have an acreage percentage for you. But as we move through and get a little bit more well control across that full 115,000-ish acres, I think we'll be in a much better position to share more quantitative metrics with you around what does that inventory truly look like going forward.","On your capital allocation question, because of the oil weighting, because of the capital efficiency of these wells, without a doubt, they have moved considerably in the priority order for capital allocation, particularly the Myrmidon very geologically advantaged area. But the Hector results that we've seen, particularly in the pads that we've drilled, are even crowding the Myrmidon performance. So, we feel really good that those are going to be near the top of our capital allocation priorities.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I appreciate that. My follow-up is also a quick one, but it's another, I guess, relative capital allocation question as well unfortunately. But \u2013 so, you've done a tremendous job putting your mark on this portfolio. It's now basically your portfolio with PayRock and with the acquisition in the Delaware, but it also means you've paid upfront for \u2013 in terms of capital employed. So, when you think about these competitive metrics for management compensation, what pace do you need to run that to get enough earnings and revenue and cash flow from those two acquired assets in order to be competitive on a return on capital employed basis now? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. First of all, I appreciate the recognition on the portfolio transformation, and that's really a recognition for the entire team here, not just for me. It's been a great team effort to get us to this stage, where a lot of that heavy-lifting is behind us and we really have turned our full attention to executing against what I think is a truly differentiated organic portfolio. In terms of the acquisition entry points, we felt that \u2013 first of all, that we entered both of those deals with very strong value propositions, meaning that we felt that the acreage price that we paid in both of those acquisitions puts us in a very competitive spot moving forward.","There were obviously acquisition economics that assumed a given pace. We're very mindful of that as a metric internally to ensure that we capture full value from that. But inevitably, as you get new data, you continue to modify those full-field development plans. And we've seen it in the STACK area, which was a case where we integrated an asset into our existing portfolio. And we're seeing the same thing in Northern Delaware, which was more of a greenfield acreage acquisition for us. So, we're very mindful of those entry costs that we paid. If you reflect back, Doug, we talked about kind of the several things we look at when we think about an acquisition.","It starts with quality, can it compete; materiality, will it make a difference; and value, which means can we drive a full-cycle return; and finally, have we saved some upside for the shareholder. And both of those two cases of acquisitions, we feel that we ticked all of those boxes. The other thing I would just mention is that we continue to support a program and resource play exploration that is much more focused on greenfield leasing and low entry cost opportunities. And that kind of runs in the background in a little bit of stealth mode. So, we hope that it's not obviously always going to be by the wallet, that we're also going to have opportunities either near basins or outside of our existing basins, where we can generate more of those low entry cost type opportunities.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, Lee. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","We have a question from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, Lee, and...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Congratulations on the Astros. Happy for you. It's been a miserable season up here in New York. So, Lee, if we can go to a high-level question, the entire returns over growth theme is clearly taking hold of the E&P industry. And I was wondering, given some of the detail you've been through, if you could, at a high level, talk to us about the endgame for where you think Marathon Oil can get to. Some people are talking about double-digit returns on a sustained basis as being a target. Others \u2013 in fact, yesterday, we had a CEO talk about best-in-class ROIC by 2020. Where do you think you can take this thing? And it's interesting that you've got this improvement in performance operationally and a little bit of a higher base to start from in terms of your dividend. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, thanks for the question, Paul. The endgame for us is a focus, and we always have been returns-focused. But we think that we can generate profitable growth and do that not only within cash flow, but when we look out towards our five-year kind of benchmark case, we also have clear line of sight on generating free cash flow yield as well. So, we're not striving just to be cash flow neutral. I want to be very clear about that. Returns, cash returns is going to be a metric that we're very mindful of. We want to make sure that our \u2013 particularly our D&C program every year is moving that enterprise metric in the right direction, that the things that we do, every new dollar that we spend is driving that metric in the correct direction.","The other metric that we're going to be watching very closely, of course, is our cash flow, debt- adjusted cash flow per share growth. And we feel there that we have a tremendous potential as we continue to expand margins to really outperform on what I think is one of the highest correlated metrics to performance in the E&P space. So, I think the combination of ensuring that each incremental dollar of capital was moving your cash returns in the correct direction at an enterprise level, and then also coupling that with strong debt adjusted growth per share on the cash flow side, we think that's a powerful combination. And those are metrics that we're going to be watching very, very closely as we come out of this transformation and kind of get shoulder in to this execution.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I guess the question is that \u2013 there's a rate of change story obviously, which is positive, but where can you end up. Can you commit to double-digit returns as an aim or some sort of leading metric that we can directly compare you on over some timeframe?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think that as we start talking more about these financial metrics, we'll get better at how to be transparent with them. Obviously, as you know, Paul, there's going to be a high variability depending upon what your price outlook is and the capital spend that goes along with that. So, there is some challenges there, I think, as you look out over time, making sure that you've wrapped the appropriate assumptions, so that the number is actually meaningful going forward. But we're going to be using these metrics to talk about our business. That's our commitment. I think when you start looking at cash flow per debt-adjusted share and growth around that, coupled with more traditional things like production CAGR, I think we'll be able to tell a much more fulsome story about what that endgame actually looks like.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. If I could just follow up on some more specific stuff. The rate of change is really impressive. And I think the way I'm hearing it, it sounds like the Bakken and Eagle Ford have kind of maybe surprising to the upside, and maybe there's a little bit of disappointment in the STACK. And I don't know, I guess neutral on the Permian. Is that fair? And in that situation, would you potentially be in a disposal mode in order to focus down the asset base on where you are improving most rapidly? Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, thanks. Certainly, without a doubt, Bakken and Eagle Ford continue to surprise to the upside. You just have to look at the well results and the capital efficiency that's being generated within those two basins. I think within the Oklahoma Basin that we still view the 340,000 net acres that we have in that basin as a tremendous high-return growth engine for the company going forward. I think we're still just very early days. And the development of the STACK, we're still in very much a leasehold and delineation and pilot mode there. And so, we should expect some variability of results. But I wouldn't extrapolate the variability in results to mean that we don't remain very keen on the development of that and bringing it up to a similar standard of efficiency that we've observed in our more mature basins.","Northern Delaware is even further kind of upstream from a development standpoint. And there, we're really just getting started. I think we're starting though very fast there. When I already sit down \u2013 I was just out in the field a few weeks ago. When I look at the efficiencies that are already being generated on the drilling and completion side, I'm very pleased that how rapidly we're coming up the learning curve there. And I think now, it's just a question of getting some more at-bats, continuing to generate the types of results that we're starting to see this quarter. We're going to be very focused on continuing to try to further consolidate our significant position there. But we're very \u2013 very confident in the Northern Delaware as an area that's going to demand more capital certainly going forward into 2018. Case in point, we picked up a dedicated frac crew at the beginning of this quarter and \u2013 as well as just added a fourth rig there.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. It's an interesting perspective that you've got assets at different points in the investment cycle. Thanks a lot, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Paul. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have a question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Brian. Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","As a lifetime Angels fan, I'm still celebrating their one World Series victory of 15 years ago. So, I can tell you this one will stay with you for a long time.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Trust me, Brian. We're going to be talking about this one for probably 50 years is my guess.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Absolutely, absolutely. So, I wanted to pick up on your comments on the debt adjusted per share growth and wanted to explore a little bit how you guys see yourself differentiating, because there's really three aspects to that, the absolute growth, the potential for a share repurchase or falling share count, and then debt pay-down. And I just wondered, as you think about being measured on that metric or focusing on that metric, where you see more of the niche for Marathon on a relative basis?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think that when I kind of break that metric apart into its pieces, Brian, I think that we are going to have very strong and competitive production growth that will be accompanying that. The change and the, if you will, the mix of that production growth over time is going to be an important element of that. You saw this year, about 60% of our barrels are really associated with the unconventional. That number is only going to drive higher. So, there's a natural, I would say, margin expansion that's going to occur even just based on the mix effect.","That's not counting all of the efficiencies that we think we can generate within that mix effect. And then finally, I think it's continuing to work diligently on the balance sheet and making sure that we really are protecting that kind of investment-grade view of our balance sheet. On the case of the shares side, that's absolutely always a tool in the whole toolkit. But we just feel that we've got higher and better uses today to drive our business and drive that metric more effectively through other mechanisms as opposed to that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for the color. And then, my follow-up goes to some of the productivity gains that you've been talking about both in the Bakken Hector area and others. Can you just talk to where, in your four key plays, you think recovery rates of oil in place are and what you see as the scope for further productivity gains over the next couple of years?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Brian. This is Mitch. I'll take that at least at a high level. I think what is compelling about the resource plays, and to some extent, the four-basin nature of our portfolio is we're able to quickly leverage things we learn in one asset to another. And the Eagle Ford has been kind of our high-activity basin for the past several years and it's where we often pilot and trial new technologies or operational efficiency gains such as larger drill pipe, offline cementing, on the operational side, extending to the central control room, where we're not only able to operate more efficiently by operating through guided routes versus just going to every well every day, but also able to maximize the base production, the production and the barrels that we've already developed.","We're able to use machine-learning techniques to optimize that and drive higher uptime through upset periods or through artificial lift optimization. We're now transferring that to other basins. So, we should not be surprised to see continued efficiency gains going forward. The rate of change in the Bakken has certainly been the most dramatic, and in terms of extending this integrated workflow that we trialed and tested in Myrmidon in 2016, pushing that down into Hector now with the same workflows and very impressive results.","Northern Delaware has been a very high rate of change as well. We've seen that as one of the catalysts for us getting in at the time we did, and we're now able to employ our completion designs combined with our facility and engineered flow-back structures. And that is becoming evident in the types of wells that we released there in Eddy County, the two Wolfcamp X-Y wells. So, from a recovery standpoint, we're dealing with a lot of different reservoirs across these basins and still in the optimization mode. So, it's difficult for me to quantify for you a single number or a single rate of change. But certainly, from a returns focus and a value focus, which is really where we're driving our teams and our business, this is all moving towards the positive.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. Kind of a macro perspective that I would ask from you, because you are one of the most geographically diversified U.S. producers now in the four plays. We've seen, particularly in the last three, four months, a great deal of volatility in basis differentials along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere, and some of that's hurricane related, some of it perhaps is not. What's your take on what's been happening with the spreads, the dips, and is any of that changing perhaps how you think about the economics in the different areas?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, obviously, we spend a lot of time thinking about the broader topic of just commodity risk \u2013 risk management, and I think that's evident in our hedging program. We're very much a defensive hedger in the sense that we want to underwrite a certain element of our capital program, while making sure that we protect some upside for our shareholders. And I think you've seen us use that as an important tool in our tool kit not only around our commodity risk management, but as part of our delivery around living within our means. That's a key element of it.","And we have explored, looking at basis differentials as well and if there are specific risk management actions that we want to take there. I think one advantage that we do have in the four-basin model is that we do have a bit of an intrinsic hedge in the sense that we have multiple markets, multiple different product mixes. And so, we have \u2013 almost just because of the diversity of our portfolio, we do have a bit of an intrinsic commodity risk management element that's embedded in our portfolio.","I think one of the more positive observations that we've had has been the differentials that we've seen, for instance in the Bakken, which have been part of the story around the strong economics there, basically trading more or less right around WTI. I think in the Eagle Ford, the support there that we've seen with the linkage primarily to LLS and Brent, it's also been quite supportive. So, we've been able to very much selectively take advantage of those opportunities from a commodity risk standpoint.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, helpful. And then, since no one's asked about Libya, let me ask you about that one. It's become a thoroughly meaningful part of your production mix again. And I guess, is there a point at which you would actually begin to guide Libyan volumes? Are there certain milestones you want to see?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think just for absolute clarity, Libya, yeah, it's gained in production, but I think you need to kind of separate production from the fact that we're still sitting on a 94% statutory tax rate there. Very little free cash flow or cash flow is being generated from Libya relative to the rest of the portfolio. I think \u2013 and I don't have the exact number in front of me. But I think if you look at our $0.59 cash flow per share for the quarter, you're talking about $0.01 of it was associated with Libya. So, I just want to make sure that we put Libya in the correct perspective, lot of barrels, low margin, somewhat limited impact on our operating cash flows.","Having said that, there still remains a good deal of uncertainty in Libya, the political, the security situation there. And as long as we're dealing with that uncertainty, we feel it's best to hold that asset below the line. We've only really been out \u2013 we came out of two years of force majeure late in 2016. So, I'm hopeful, but even this year does not necessarily a trend make, and we just need to be very mindful that this is still a relatively charged and higher risk environment, and we're going to continue to approach it that way. But from a materiality standpoint, on cash flows, I don't think that there's any push there for us to drive that into the bottom line, because it's just not a big impact to us.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We have a question from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hey, a couple of questions. You made a point a couple of times that with some of the potential free cash flow, you'd look at bolt-on opportunities across your resource plays. I maybe reading this \u2013 into this a little bit differently, but just help me out is \u2013 are you guys actively looking at several things? So, should we be surprised as we go through 2018 if you all have made a few nice chunky add-ons to your core positions?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think, Scott, we're always going to be watching the market, particularly in our core areas. And to the extent that we can find smaller fit-for-purpose bolt-ons that provide synergy to our existing core position, then we're absolutely going to look at those. In particular, Northern Delaware is an area that still remains of high interest to continue. We like our scale, but we would certainly like to strengthen our operated positions there just from a consolidation standpoint.","So, you should expect us to continue to do everything from greenfield leasing to small bolt-ons there in Northern Delaware, as those opportunities present themselves. And those things will afford us an opportunity to drive our working interest up to convert some maybe non-operated pieces to operated. And at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we're adding those incremental net well opportunities at a cost that's accretive to the overall kind of position there in Northern Delaware.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's good color. And specifically, my angle was \u2013 and maybe I should have been upfront with this \u2013 is that it seems like the Bakken is getting a lot of attention today and the returns have been pretty good. And if you step back and look, a lot of industry has moved frankly from the Eagle Ford into the Bakken to the Permian. And are there opportunities in those basins where industry has sort of left that you all see as strategic in your portfolio?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","All of our core basins, I would say, we're always mindful of opportunities, but they have to kind of pass through the filter of \u2013 first of all, we're not looking to buy someone else's decline curve. We want to make sure that it's bringing opportunities and inventory that will come in and compete with our existing portfolio. We're not looking to acquire things that aren't going to be developed for another decade. And so, there is a relatively high bar just because of the quality and the success that we've generated in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken. We certainly aren't looking to dilute our high-quality position in either of those locations.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Having said that, if the right opportunity does come up, Scott, we would certainly take a hard look at it. We're driving an incredible amount of capital efficiency at scale in both of those assets. So, if there are, again, smaller opportunities that kind of fit our pistol, then we're going to be on it.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, great, great. And if I could slip one more in, in the STACK play and just Oklahoma in general, can you remind us, when you look at in the next 12 to 18 months, how much in maybe in rig counts or just general framework, how much work do you all need to do on delineating and piloting versus starting to look at developments in that area? So, I think if I'm not mistaken, you're around 10 to 12 rigs there right now.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. We're probably more on the order of about eight rigs in Oklahoma today, just for clarity. And maybe the way I might calibrate that a little bit for you, Scott, would be to say, as we look ahead, for instance at the fourth quarter, we still have about, I think \u2013 and Mitch will correct me if I got the number wrong here \u2013 about 40% of leasehold drilling still in the fourth quarter. And as you might recall, we talked about leasehold requirements really extending throughout most of 2018 and a little bit into 2019 in the STACK. So, that's still going to feature as a large element and component of our capital program.","Along with that, we're also going to still be doing delineation as well as pilot testing. Another great example is if you look at \u2013 again, I'm kind of focusing on the fourth quarter program, because we've described the demographics of that a little more carefully. I said 40% of that is leasehold, but there's also a large element of it when you consider both the Eve and the Tan infill pilots that is pilot directed as well. So, probably about half the program, when you look at those wells, is really geared toward continuing to move the ball forward on our pilot testing as well. So, that's the kind of mix that we're going to continue to see as we look to delineate as well as protect leasehold in STACK.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Roger.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Roger. Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Just a follow-up on the debt-adjusted per share growth. So, obviously, a lot of components to that. You can lower debt, you can raise your growth, you can reduce number of shares. I know the question has been asked a little bit here about share repos. But as you step back and look at the debt you can pay back, is that something to watch the next 18 months? After that, free cash flow is a combination of allocation to growth, which, let's face it, I don't know you need to grow any faster. So, should we think about that overall calculation as ultimately that's another way to improve the metric?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think I'll maybe offer a few comments, and then perhaps Dane wants to jump in a little bit more on capital structure. But you're right, there are a lot of moving pieces within the \u2013 kind of the debt adjusted cash flow per growth \u2013 or cash flow per share metric. Directionally, we've been very clear that investment-grade rating is important to us. We think that an element of getting that back to all three agencies and protecting where we are with the two that currently have us at IG is a continuous focus on what can we do to drive our capital structure in a direction that will support that IG rating.","The nice thing about that, and we saw this demonstrated when we did the debt reduction this year, is that when you take those actions, they also have some other very strong benefits. And in the case of our latest action, we were able to pull some $65 million of corporate cost right out. There's not many places where you can drive that magnitude of reduction in your corporate cost structure. So, we're going to be looking to find that combination of things that will allow us to continue to delever, but also afford us the opportunity to impact our corporate cost structure as well. I don't know, Dane, if you have anything you'd like to add.","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","I would just add, I think we're in very strong liquidity position right now. We've got $1.8 billion at the end of quarter in cash, and we've got another $750 million coming in on the second installment for the OSM divestiture in Q1. And so, as we look at the capital structure, I think we have the flexibility to act when it makes sense for us to act. There are elements in the debt structure that are actually callable at par today. So, we'll keep trying to drive to the benefits that Lee described and really focus on that capital structure.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then, looking at your Permian acreage, I know early days here and still on a leasehold focus. But with the cash that you do have, the liquidity you have, and to take a look at sort of the geographic spread of the acres, you definitely are going to want to get a little more contiguous acreage, I would think, to ultimately pursue 10,000-foot laterals. Where are you in that process? I guess I'm trying to think about it. Is it a daily process to make that happen or is there a single transaction we need to be focused on that brings that contiguous nature to the Northern Delaware?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Great question. No, it is a daily process that's really integrated in not only with our asset team, but also our resource play exploration team. We have a small kind of purpose-built team that sits in Midland that has their A No. 1 priority each and every day looking at swaps, trades, greenfield leasing that continue to move the needle on, just as you described it, Roger, getting more access to XL potential, higher working interest, conversion of some of our leases over from non-op to op. All of those things are going on.","It's kind of a singles and doubles kind of game. It's some hard-lifting from a land perspective to get those done. Particularly swaps and trades are always complex. No one wants to say that they've got the ugly baby in a trade. But \u2013 so, you've got to work through some of that. But we're making good progress. And I think you'll see a mix of those kinds of swaps, trades, leasing as well as some continued smaller acquisitions that again drive that synergy and help us continue to move toward a more consolidated position. So, it's a bit of an all-of-the-above strategy, but it is going to be an everyday proposition and it's going to look more like, again, singles and doubles along the way.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, Lee, and your team. Could you speak about the Osage test in the Oklahoma Resource? And this is kind of a little multi-parter here. You can answer whatever you like. Did it meet or exceed your expectation going in? Will we get more Osage tests in the area? Can the cost be competitive with the other zones and do you have any multi-zone development potential in this area of the Osage exposure?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Absolutely, Jeff. This is Mitch. I'll try to remember all of those questions, but...","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I can repeat them.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","That's right. Yeah, if I missed one, I'm sure you'll remind me. But starting off with the White well, we're certainly quite encouraged by the early performance on that well. We've, I think, talked in the past, a few quarters back, on a few other Osage tests that we've done, and we have seen some variability in there, as industry has, which is the nature of the Osage play. It's quite extensive. Certainly, it covers the vast majority underlying our Meramec oil window and even extends further to the North, where some others are doing some testing there and certainly to the East. So, we do see it as prospective and extensive. We're quite encouraged by the White, but we also recognize that it's a play with some variability, and we're still in the process of defining the true prospectivity and high-grading of that across our position.","I think it's important to note that \u2013 and we talked about this as well following the PayRock announcement that while we recognized its potential, it wasn't contributing to the value that we paid for in the acquisition. So, this is upside that we're looking to exploit and kind of selectively integrate into our program as part of the delineation effort. We will have an upcoming pad, where we'll be looking at co-development of the Meramec and Osage and likely a Woodford test in the same trial, but certainly the Meramec and Osage. So, stay tuned, there will be more to come on this, but we definitely like it. From a well cost standpoint, we'd also think it's quite competitive. A little different completion style required here, which actually drives cost a little bit below kind of our average Meramec D&C costs.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well, that was great color, and you certainly have a good memory, so thank you. And I just want to ask a last question on portfolio management. I'm just wondering...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","At this stage of the game, would you consider revisiting or selling any of your International assets? I know there's some interesting dynamics here, because we know that some of them are free cash flow generators, but you also mentioned the margin uplift from increased unconventional production. And we saw a pretty favorable peer sale in the Equatorial Guinea not too long ago.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. The way I would ask you to think about our portfolio today, Jeff, is the \u2013 it's the four core U.S. basins plus EG. And to the extent that we have other assets that lie outside of that grouping, you should think about those as being non-core and areas that, if we can generate value for the shareholder, we would certainly be looking to do so, because those assets simply don't compete for capital allocation and would likely have more value within someone else's portfolio.","So, portfolio management, a lot of the heavy-lifting is behind us on some of the big pieces. But it's just \u2013 again, similar to what we were talking about earlier, this is just part of what we do day-in and day-out, is scrutinizing every aspect of our portfolio and asking the question how can we maximize value. We kind of crossed the, I would say, the hurdle a little bit on getting our capital allocation concentrated where we want it, that 95% kind of capital allocation. But the volumes are still playing a little bit of catch-up.","We do think that things \u2013 assets like Equatorial Guinea are still very key to our overall business model delivery. But to the extent that assets, again, beyond our resource basins and EG, we need to look at those very carefully and make sure that they are playing a unique and additive role within today's portfolio. And if they're not, we need to start looking at other options. Then, as you saw from some of our commentary in the release, we did, in fact, have some transactional activity on the International front in some of our less material non-core assets. So, our expectation is that portfolio clean-up continues over time.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That was a very clear answer. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Lee Tillman for final remarks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, I very much appreciate your questions today. I appreciate your interest in Marathon Oil. Thank you very much and have a great day. That ends our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Philips. Mr. Philips, you may begin.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm Chris Philips, Director of Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; J.R. Sult, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mitch Little, Vice President International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations; Lance Robertson, Vice President North America Production Operations; and Zach Dailey, Director of Investor Relations.","As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release.

Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the quarterly information package on our website.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, good morning. Thank you, Chris.","Our priorities this year has been exercising capital discipline, reducing cost, capturing efficiencies, progressing our non-core asset sales and protecting the balance sheet, and our most recent actions have been fully consistent with those objections.","Last Thursday, we announced the decision by the board of the directors to adjust our quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share. We felt that this action was prudent, in the best interest of all shareholders and appropriately addresses the uncertainty of a lower for longer commodity price environment.","It will increase annual free cash flow by more than $425 million and aligns with our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle. The additional capital flexibility is essential to support growth from our deep inventory of investment opportunities in the U.S. resource plays, when commodity prices improved. Further, it is another step in the transformation of Marathon Oil from an integrated legacy to becoming a leading independent E&P company focused on capturing value in the U.S. unconventional resource plays.","Turning to the third quarter, we delivered operational results that reflected consistent execution, efficiency gains and lower cost. The third quarter capital investment and exploration program came in below expectations, down 7% sequentially to $623 million. We've been able to reduce our 2015 program by $200 million to $3.1 billion, primarily through a combination of U.S. resource play efficiency gains, and phasing of international projects.","Total company net production from continuing operations excluding Libya, averaged 434,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter and a 7% increase over the prior quarter. Record production from oil sands mining and higher production from Equatorial Guinea contributed to the increase from the prior quarter.","We're on pace to achieve the high end of our total company 2015 production growth guidance at 7% year-over-year and U.S. resource play growth at 20%, even with the $200 million reduction to our 2015 program.","In the U.S. resource play net production average 212,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 10% over the year-ago quarter and down 4% over the prior quarter. Our quarterly variance was driven primarily by lower sequential production from the Eagle Ford due to timing of wells to sales late in the third quarter and step out in delineation drilling tests. Our asset teams target the right balance of high confidence development activity and continued resource delineation that positions us for growth as we look through the current cycle.","In the case of Eagle Ford for this quarter the team was focused on development drilling in core Karnes County, while also testing the limits of delineated acreage. We had another quarter of solid reductions and completed well costs, faster feet per day drilled and more frac stages completed per month. We also previously announced additions to Eagle Ford 2P resource of 165 million oil equivalent barrels driven by the upper Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk.","Though our operated Oklahoma resource basins program is still dominated by leasehold activity, we brought our first SCOOP Woodford down spacing pilot on line late in the third quarter. Early results are in line with our type curve and supported of 107 acre spacing. Importantly, the learning curve improvement as we drilled and completed the well illustrate the potential for the Oklahoma to become significantly more efficient when we move to development mode. During the quarter we announced a 35% increase in SCOOP & STACK 2P resource adding 400 million oil equivalent barrels.","The Bakken team had an outstanding quarter despite reduced completion activity, delivering 61,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with second quarter volumes. Results were driven by continued outperformance from the Doll pad wells in West Myrmidon, enhanced uptime as well as consistent performance from our three down-spacing pilots.","The team continued to aggressively attack cost, lowering direct expense in the quarter from a variety of factors, reduce water handling cost and contract services, getting more of our product on pipelines and greater efficiency gains from workover rigs.","International productions and sales volumes were higher in the quarter, primarily as a result of the performance of the new Alba C-21 well, the EG wireline intervention program and high operational availability. The EG compression project achieved mechanical completion during the third quarter and is preparing for transportation from the Netherlands to site. Installation and startup is set for mid-2016.","Oil sands mining reported outstanding operational results in the third quarter, recording the highest level of production in the history of the asset as well as the lowest operating cost ever per synthetic barrel. These results were driven by increased reliability and uptime as well as an intense focus on reducing cost.","We've made great strides so far this year focusing on those elements of the business that we control by reducing activity levels and capturing capital efficiencies. We've also reduced total company E&P production expenses and G&A cost, excluding special items, by about $136 million or 28% for third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014. Similarly, on a year-to-date basis, the savings amount to over $290 million, over 20%.","Drilling efficiency remained a focus across our U.S. unconventional plays, with our best Eagle Ford rig drilling a well that averaged 3,000 feet per day in the third quarter, similar to the exceptional pacesetter performance in the previous quarter. This performance was achieved while maintaining our geo-steering accuracy to land in the target window 98% of the time. Our other two areas, the Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins, also continue to show sustained improvement in their drilling efficiency.","Portfolio management remains front and center, and we continue to make progress advancing our plan of divesting at least $500 million of non-core assets. What we've identified for sale are non-core E&P and midstream assets, operated and non-operated, that simply do not compete for capital today given the depth and breadth of our inventory in the U.S. resource plays and will likely have higher value in someone else's portfolio.","During the quarter, we announced our strategic intent to scale back our conventional exploration business as the success of our U.S. resource play has continued to raise the bar for capital allocation. Commensurate with this decision, we signed an agreement to divest our exploration acreage in East Africa.","Last week, we provided initial guidance on our 2016 capital investment and exploration program, as we continue to progress through the planning process with the overarching goal of living within our means next year, inclusive of dividend and non-core asset sales.","Based on our current outlook and preliminary plan discussions, we would anticipate a total company 2016 program of up to $2.2 billion, which would give us the flexibility to deliver 2016 annual average production in the U.S. resource plays flat to 2015 exit rate. This represents a significant reduction from our $3.1 billion program in 2015. But at least three quarters of our 2016 program is expected to be directed toward the U.S. resource play which offer our highest risk-adjusted returns. We expect our 2016 budget to be approved by the board of directors later this year.","There's no doubt that the macro environment continues to challenge the industry, but one thing remains clear, Marathon Oil is not opportunity limited. We have profitable inventory even in a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario as lower cost, capital efficiency and enhanced productivity continue to reduce breakeven prices and improve our economics.","Our priority remains balance sheet strength and capital flexibility in 2016. And we have a workforce that is responding to the challenge and positioning our company for success today and through the cycle.","I want to pause and personally thank and recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who continue to execute and deliver results while protecting our license to operate each and every day, despite the distractions and uncertainties of the current environment.","With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we'd like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications, and you can re-prompt as time permits.","With that, Sylvia, we'll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Ilya Balabanovsky - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Ilya. Evan got stuck on the refining call, so I'm going to fill in for him. Thanks for taking the questions. You put out up to $2.2 billion CapEx guidance for 2016 out there last week. What is the primary governor on your activity next year? Are you trying to keep resource play production flat, are you trying to limit spending to a certain level or, I mean, is the primary goal to reach certain specific \u2013 target-specific goals in individual basins?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Well, of course, for us, as we've stated, the objective for us in 2016, particularly in the current pricing environment, will be balance sheet protection. And, of course, balancing our cash flows and living within our means. That is our primary objective.","We're still very much in the planning cycle. The numbers we presented are preliminary. The work is ongoing. But we felt it important, as we communicated the change or the adjustment in the dividend, to also pair that up with at least an early view of 2016 outlook.","Ilya Balabanovsky - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And kind of a follow-up, I mean, what does your Oklahoma program look like in 2016? Maybe \u2013 I mean, both in terms of rig count and in more qualitative terms? I mean, how you are thinking \u2013 how you're thinking about operated activity versus non-operated activity, to what extent is it going to be driven by HBP? I mean, will we expect to see more Woodford wells because you're trying to hold the entire depth? So can you kind of give some color on that? Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thus far, of course because we're still very early in the planning process, we haven't provided quite that level of granularity down to the basin level, but that will be coming as we finalize the plan. However, what I will share that is as incremental cash flow comes available, and we think about our program in 2016, due to the returns and the growth potential in Oklahoma, we expect it to compete very favorably in the capital allocation process. So I would just say more to come on that point as we finalize our plan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Lee, I wonder if I could ask a little bit about how you're preparing the portfolio for \u2013 let's be optimistic for a second \u2013 some kind of rebound in the commodity over time. You've obviously right-sized the dividend and you've got clearly significant depth in the Oklahoma Basin in particular. So, I'm just kind of thinking, as you look at incremental capital allocation going forward, where would you see the priorities? And if I may tack on an add-on there, how do you see reallocating capital from your non-core assets? Can you maybe quantify how much capital might be associated with the non-core stuff as well? I've got a follow-up please.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay Very good. Well, thanks and good morning, Doug. Of course, our decision around the adjustment and the dividend, one of the aspects of that was in fact the capital flexibility that it provides as we think about driving more allocation into the resource plays as we see more constructive pricings.","But as we think about where that first incremental capital may be directed, Doug, the way I think about it is it's going to be driven by economics, which today says that that capital would be targeted toward incremental activity in both the Eagle Ford as well as ultimately Oklahoma, expanding our operated program in Oklahoma.","In terms of the non-core asset question, maybe let me step back and just address that in general first and foremost. We have high confidence in our $500 million target that we have put out on the non-core assets. We have, of course, shared that we had, in fact, closed the earlier announced deal in East Texas, North Louisiana. We have many of those opportunities in process today and continue to feel that there is a market out there for the right type of assets. So our confidence in that remains very high.","There will, no doubt, be implications as we are successful in those transactions from a capital avoidance standpoint, but it's probably a bit premature to get into those numbers until we actually are able to execute deals.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that Lee. My follow-up is really in your \u2013 I guess your earlier press release you talked about, the $2.2 billion holding the exit rate in the unconventional flat. I guess, I know it's a little early for 2016 yet, but one of your peers \u2013 one of your partners rather has talked about the fairly hefty maintenance you're going to have at Equatorial Guinea. So, I wonder if you could give us some \u2013 just order of magnitude as to how you see the portfolio production outlook with that level of spending going into next year, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think \u2013 let me \u2013 I believe what you're referring to, Doug, as we look out into 2016, there will naturally be associated scheduled and planned downtime as we do the installation of the compression project. That, of course, is fully accounted for in the preliminary numbers that we have shared thus far. So that work is integrated into that. So as we think about that 4Q exit that we talked about, which was really talking about the resource plays, 4Q exit to full-year 2016 average, that's really outside of the total company.","But when you think about it from a total company perspective, given that we have provided direct guidance on the resource plays, I like to think about it in really a few kind of large buckets. One is, of course, Equatorial Guinea, which will largely be flat ex the downtime that I just addressed.","Two, oil sands mining, which will have largely, again, a flat profile ex planned maintenance and turnaround, we do have some other North America onshore assets that will have relatively shallow declines. And then, of course, in our conventional GOM and mature UK businesses, which albeit relatively small volumes, we'd expect those to have typical mature declines.","So as you put that overlay on it, I just wanted to try to give a feel for what volumes might feel like in their totality in 2016.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Congrats on a lot of tough decisions so far this year for the downturn. I've got, I guess, two questions looking at perhaps further out. The first one is on the Eagle Ford. Folks are worried that \u2013 about your Tier 1 Eagle Ford inventory relative to Tier 2. So, maybe just a reminder of how much Tier 1 years of drilling you think you have, and then what sort of degradation you think there is in the portfolio as you get out towards the fringe.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Yeah. Ed, good morning. This is Lance. I think as we look at it, perhaps where I'd start with is, earlier in this quarter, we actually disclosed an unconventional resource portfolio in North America of 5,500 wells. And of that portfolio, I think we described the first five years of it, 77% of that returns better than breakeven at $50 flat oil. And of that inventory, Eagle Ford is by far the largest component. And I think we have confidence we have many years of what you describe as Tier 1, or high-quality development, left in that asset, Ed.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, switching to the SCOOP and probably on the same kind of topic. Really, it's only the XLs on the current economics that really look like they can compete with some of the best shale that's in other basins. So, where do you think you can get the D&C cost down to perhaps for the shorter laterals? I mean, how many XLs do you think you can drill as a percent of the total?","And then, where do we think we are in the completion cycle in terms of optimization to boost the EURs? I'm just trying to get sense of how much momentum there can be in that play in terms of recycle ratios and returns.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Ed, I think I'd start maybe at the last end of that question first. I think we have a lot of confidence that we're so early in the development cycle in both of the Oklahoma resource basins, both SCOOP and STACK, that we're nowhere near the highest efficiency, best completions yet. So, we expect well productivity to continue to increase over time, particularly as we get to scale and we have more opportunity to experiment in a structured way.","Similarly, maybe perhaps best illustrated by the Smith pilot that was in our earnings deck, we also expect that more mature development cycle as it unfolds for us to really be able to materially impact the capital costs. I think that example where we're down 33% from the front-end to the back-end of that pad is emblematic of what we expect on a full-cycle basis.","So I have complete confidence that we're going to continue to deliver both better costs and better productivity in Oklahoma, and that's going to help both the XL wells and the SL wells compete favorably for capital across the cycle.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","For investors who have looked to Marathon historically in part for that dividend, now, as you've made the tough decision to cut that dividend, is there an offsetting metric that you and the board are looking to improve or bolster as a result of that cut? Could be production growth, maybe corporate returns, or does the dividend cut just help you to maintain your balance sheet objectives which would potentially argue for a dividend increase if oil prices were to rise?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think, Brian, I believe our board is looking at it quite holistically. They're looking at it in an aggregate for all shareholders, what is the model based on our portfolio that will deliver the best total shareholder return. When you think about the logic, I believe, that the board went through with the leadership team, it was really looking at the dividend in the context of appropriately addressing this lower for longer environment and the uncertainty that's associated with it. It was really making certain that we could protect our balance sheet through the cycle.","And then finally, and I think most importantly, it provides us that capital flexibility going forward as we see more constructive pricings to drive more investment at a higher return into the U.S. resource plays. And of course, it gave us an increase in our free cash flows by greater than $425 million.","So, I believe the board looked at it holistically, it looked at it in the context of the preliminary plan data that we had to share with them at the time, and it was really that collective logic that went into it.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then, follow up is with regards to one of the earlier questions on Eagle Ford and on the tiering; that would be (24:24) oil as a percent of the total in the mix has come down a bit here. Can you talk to whether that is timing, based on the timing of completions, and how the oiliness looks of the remaining inventory and the remaining locations there, and how that translates to the 2016 program?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Hey, Brian. I mean, our Eagle Ford asset has a substantial oil component, a substantial condensate component, and some wet condensate, a little bit of that as well. And so in this environment, the lower for longer, we're \u2013 in a disciplined way, we're choosing the highest return opportunities at current pricing. The condensate's generally been providing those returns, and so we're seeing a small change in mix to a little bit less oil overall.","We still have large inventory in the oil and in the condensate left to develop in the future. And depending on commodity prices, we're going to consistently choose those highest return opportunities. As large as the base is, overall, we don't expect the mix to change very much over the \u2013 on the long-haul basis.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen, Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","From your second quarter update to your third quarter update in the Eagle Ford, your net wells to sales increased. Can you talk about how that, the increase for this year and kind of what the expectation is now for fourth quarter versus net wells drilled didn't change?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure. I think one of the things we've seen, David, over the balance of this year is we just continue to get more and more efficient overall, both in the completion cycle and in the drilling cycle. I think we've illustrated that in the deck. And we continue to avoid building an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells.","So what you're seeing is us manage as we get more efficient with those rigs and we do it at lower cost, we have more opportunity to invest. We're just managing that inventory in an efficient operational basis overall. No intent to build inventory or to deplete it. We want to keep it relatively constant. And so we're managing that actively, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then in your \u2013 just one quick question on EG. How much downtime will you have for the compression project? How long will that take?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President\u2014International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations","Yeah. Hey, David. This is Mitch Little. We have the installation campaign for the new compression platform that Lee spoke to earlier, and we would look at on the order of a couple of weeks to facilitate the initial installation of the jacket and topsides. We also have scheduled planned maintenance that is part of delivering our high reliability in those assets.","And so there will some partial downtime associated with that that will also occur in the first quarter. But going into the second half of the year, of course, we'll have the benefits from that compression project that will bring rates back up to above even current rates.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And just one quick one on the Meramec wells, the EG one was just a fit in. The well results, kind of thinking about rates and well design. Can you talk about \u2013 I would have thought that area would have been a little gassier. It looks a little oilier. Just, Lance, can you kind of go through thoughts on what happened in that part of Kingfisher?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure, David. I think as we're working through this early part of the Meramec, it's important to realize that we're focusing primarily on leasehold drilling. So we're covering a diverse area of several counties to convert these term leases to held-by-production. We expect to see some diversity in those early well results. We're still working on the best designs in the completion and how we manage those wells in the early days.","So, I think while our results aren't perhaps as much as we desire, we expected this diversity, it's early days. We're excited about seeing the continued momentum in the basin. The IPs continue to get better. The productivity is improving overall. And importantly, the cost improvements over the last year have been very material. And on top of that, you're seeing us continue to be opportunistic in adding acres in this area at attractive pricing as we continue to see this as a great place to invest in the future.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Most things have been asked, but I was just curious with Shenandoah. Is that an asset strategically that would be better off with one of your partners in terms of taking that cash flow or future CapEx and then dedicating it more towards the resource plays?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, great question. On Shenandoah, of course, we're still very much early in the appraisal phase. We've seen some excellent results from the last appraisal well, and I think we shared those as well as the operator has shared those. We haven't reached an investment decision, of course, around Shenandoah in the base case. Ultimately, it will need to compete for capital allocation head to head with the rest of our opportunities.","But until we see the final development plan and can make, I would say, a thoughtful decision around that, I think that's an open question.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lee.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I apologize if some of this has been asked. I did get on the call a little bit late. In the unconventionals, when you announced the dividend reduction, the initial CapEx for 2016, the expectation the U.S. unconventionals could be flattish, I think, is the right way to think about it in 2016 with the 2015 exit rate.","Is there a \u2013 and we've heard these questions asked other places. Is there a rationale to keep that flat because of the challenges of recovering once oil prices come up and you start drilling more in terms of fighting decline curves? Or should we think of it as, no, in a $45 to $50 oil environment, that really is a reasonable way to invest in terms of just the returns of those wells today?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the way we have thought about that very preliminary guidance that we provided, Roger, is really rooted in our overarching objective of balance sheet protection. And in the current environment, a sub $50 environment we are not solving for growth at that point. We are really looking at living within our means inclusive of both the dividend as well as our non-core asset program.","The preliminary guidance we provided we believe provides us a pathway to that cash flow neutrality. But as we see more constructive pricing or a more constructive outlook, certainly we'll take a thoughtful approach to how we allocate that and the number one column (32:08) in that allocation will be our U.S. resource plays. But I'd just emphasize that we're still very early still in the planning cycle.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And kind of as a follow-up to that, is there anything that you've changed. You mentioned earlier the shift towards maybe a little more of the NGL condensate side because that's where the economics are. Is there anything you've changed in the sort of initial production of your wells, the first 30 days, 90 days, something like that, in terms of choking them back to \u2013 why, in other words, sell all your production up front when the prices aren't particularly impressive? And whether or not you've considered anything on the hedging side?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Roger, I'd say operationally, we continue to bring the wells back in each basin based on the flow back parameters that drive the best well productivity. We're not managing those lower, I think in the way you're describing just to manage the production profile.","We're doing it to drive best well productivity","In some small cases basin-to-basin where there \u2013 you may have a once in a while a limitation on gas capture, for example, in North Dakota, or we may build a facility that slightly undersized to minimize our spend, and we'll peak shave. But those tend to be short term and those are the exception not the rule. So overall we're continuing to manage the chokes and the flowback to drive best well productivity.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And hedging, any thoughts on that?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Roger, this is J.R. I mean I think you should consider the fact that hedging will be an element of a broader commodity risk management strategy going forward. And as opportunities present themselves in the market we'll continue to look at ways to protect more of the downside commodity price risk in the portfolio.","Operator","And the next question comes from the Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Well, at the risk of sounding like a CNBC debate moderator, I got to push you a little bit on the dividend. Three months ago you used very, very strong language in explaining why the dividend is the first call on cash flow. And I guess I'm just curious, what in the last 90 days \u2013 what was the specific trigger for shifting from it is the first call on cash flow to cutting it 76%?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Pavel, I mean first of all I would still say even with our current dividend level, that is \u2013 remains our first call on cash flow. But in terms of the why now question, which I believe is what you're asking around the adjustment to the dividend. The way I would describe that is, first of all, it's really been a further and continued volatility and weakness in the commodity pricing environment.","I would say, secondly, it's been a growing confidence in the quality, but most importantly the depth of our U.S. resource play base, which we just added in the past quarter 600 million oil equivalent barrels of 2P resource there.","And then, I would say the third factor that really was the trigger point is that we were able to share a preliminary view of our plan at the board level. So, there was \u2013 we had the ability to put that dividend adjustment in the context of our forward outlook and plan. So, those were really the three, I would say, triggers, Pavel, in terms of the why now question.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then, kind of shifting to 2016, I know you said you haven't finalized the specific geographic components of the CapEx. But do you envision there being any kind of carve-outs from the CapEx curtailments? And I'm thinking Oklahoma perhaps, any areas that will get special treatment or protection from the overall 30% cut?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, again, we're going to follow our rigorous capital allocation process, Pavel. So that it's going to be driven by economics. But there are cases, and Lance alluded to one earlier, where there are lost opportunity aspects to some of the plays, specifically in Oklahoma, where we still have significant term lease that we need to hold. We are going to be looking to protect that as a top priority.","So, I wouldn't necessarily call that special treatment. I would just call that being smart about our business.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you for your questions and interest in Marathon Oil. I'd like to thank everyone again for their participation this morning.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Guy Baber, Guy, you may begin.","Guy Baber","Thanks, James. And I'm, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Yesterday after the close we issued a press release a slide presentation and investor packet that address our second quarter results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO, Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO, Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations, and Pat Wagner, our Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy. As always, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who'll provide his opening remarks.","We will then open the call up to Q&A.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Guy. And thank you to everyone joining us this morning. Second quarter featured truly exceptional execution, not just across our advantaged multi basin portfolio but across all aspects of our business. This consistent differentiated execution against a transparent framework for capital discipline is driving compelling bottom-line operational and more importantly, financial outcomes.","Financial outcomes that compete not only against our independent E&P peers but against the broader market as well. We are consistently and comprehensively delivering against our framework for success. We are driving significant bottom-line corporate returns improvement, we are generating sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing. We are returning a considerable portion of that free cash flow back to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we are improving our capital efficiency, cost structure and resource base through differentiated execution.","Our strong operational and financial performance is powered by a transform portfolio and a top tier balance sheet providing the foundation for continued execution success through the commodity cycle. Turning to second quarter highlights the enterprise level Proofpoint speak for themselves and signal a continuation of a trend that is now well established over multiple quarters, it all starts with our returns first orientation.","During second quarter, we realized an annualized cash return on invested capital of 20% consistent with the prior year quarter despite a 12% decline in WTI price and meaningful weakness in secondary product pricing. The underlying improvement in our corporate returns underscores our success across multiple dimensions, portfolio management, concentrated capital allocation, more efficient operations, high-margin oil growth cash cost reductions and lower completed well costs.","Second is our commitment to sustainable free cash flow generation at conservative pricing. For many, this objective remains aspirational but our track record on this front is now well established with six consecutive quarters of positive organic free cash flow post dividend. We aren't just talking about free cash flow are forecasting it for the future, we are delivering it here and now. During second quarter, we generated $137 million of post dividend organic free cash flow.","Since the beginning of 2018, we have now delivered over $1 billion of cumulative organic free cash flow post dividend for our shareholders. Our annualized organic free cash flow yield is about 5% year to date and 8% since 2018 placing us competitively, not only with our E&P peers but also with the broader market.","Our portfolio is resilient and capable of generating free cash flow below current pricing with a peer leading enterprise breakeven oil price. We also retain significant upside leverage to even modest oil price support. And rest assured any higher pricing we realize will translate directly to higher free cash flow, not higher activity through our commitment to capital discipline. Importantly, our underlying free cash flow momentum is improving over the second half of 2019 and into 2020 driven by strong productivity, declining well costs and cash cost reductions across our asset base.","Third, we continue to return significant capital back to our shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases. Year to date, we have repurchased $250 million of our own shares with $230 million executed during 2Q as we took advantage of our attractively valued stock. Almost 90% of the over $1 billion in post dividend free cash flow generated since the beginning of 2018 has been returned back to our shareholders through share repurchases, reducing our outstanding share count by over 6%.","In combination with our dividend, we have returned over $330 million to shareholders year-to-date and $1.2 billion since the beginning of 2018 equating to 25% of our operating cash flow. We have a well-established track record of returning capital to our shareholders. To underscore that commitment we are one of the only E&Ps that has incorporated a return of capital metric into our executive compensation scorecard.","And we are well positioned to build on this track record with our board's recent decision to increase our outstanding share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. We are generating free cash flow in the current environment. At a time when our share price remains significantly disconnected from its fundamental value.","We therefore believe that the disciplined repurchase of our own shares funded entirely by organic free cash flow is one of the highest return uses of our capital and represents a somewhat unique counter-cyclical opportunity. Finally, differentiated execution is the engine that powers our delivery against our commitments, both operational and financial, our culture is built on continuous improvement in our capital efficiency and our operating cost and in our resource base. And to that end, second quarter was truly a standout from an execution perspective.","High margin US oil production exceeded the top end of our guidance and was up 17% from the year-ago quarter. Our total company production exceeded the top end of our guidance range as well. I've said it multiple times and I'll say it again, our budget is not a suggestion, It is a commitment, our teams understand this. And we have spent exactly one half of our development capital at the midpoint of the year fully consistent with our plan.","We are solidly on track to deliver on our original $2.4 billion annual development capital budget, while also achieving our key 2019 objectives and ensuring operational momentum into 2020. Importantly, we are driving a declining trend and completed well costs per lateral foot in each of our basins. We also continue to drive a declining trend in our cash cost as US unit production costs were down 14% from the year-ago quarter, the lowest since we became an independent E&P in 2011.","Similarly, our international unit cost is also the lowest it has been since we became an independent following the successful divestment of our interest in Kurdistan and the UK, our 9th and 10th country exit since 2013. Our portfolio of assets has never been stronger, simplified to our high performing US resource plays and our free cash flow generating integrated business in EG and all of this is supported by a balance sheet that is investment grade at all three primary rating agencies with upgrades from both Moody's and S&P this quarter.","Turning now to the asset-specific highlights that are driving the enterprise-level success, I just highlighted. In the Eagle Ford, we are delivering financial returns and free cash flow that compete with any basin across the Lower 48. Second-quarter was highlighted by record well productivity as measured by average IP30. Despite a majority of our quarterly activity concentrated outside of Karnes County, demonstrating the strength of the expanded core and the value and acreage that just a few years ago was viewed as lower tier.","We delivered excellent results across our Eagle Ford footprint, we established a new IP30 pad record in Karnes County. We delivered tremendous results from 15 wells across the oil window of Atascosa County and we successfully applied enhanced completions in Gonzalo County a specific area last tested by us over two years ago as we continue to uplift the inventory quality across our Eagle Ford acreage. Most importantly, the bottom line, capital efficiency of the Eagle Ford continues to improve with 2019 productivity tracking ahead of the prior year, while completed well cost per lateral foot are on a declining trend.","In the Bakken, we are delivering bottom-line results that build on a well-earned reputation as best in basin. Our industry-leading productivity is well established and conclusively validated by public data. On a 90-day cumulative oil production basis, we now account for 20 of the top 25 wells and 60 of the top 100 wells in the Williston Basin. Despite accounting for only 9% of total wells drilled.","We are relentlessly focused on capital efficiency with year-to-date completed well cost down 15% from the 2018 average and half of our second quarter wells delivered at an average completed well cost of $5 million or below, a number not thought possible just a few years ago. Additionally, extended production history is validating critical prior year core extension test, highlighting the strength of our broader acreage footprint as well as our operational capability.","Turning to Oklahoma with a firmly established foundation of strong and predictable results at optimized spacing designs and supported by another quarter of productivity outperformance. Our team has been focusing on improving capital efficiency and our efforts are paying dividends. Most notably, our two most recent over pressured STACK in fills achieved industry-leading drilling and completion cost. These six wells were delivered at an average completed well costs of just $6.3 million, normalized to a 10,000 foot lateral.","Over the second half of the year, our Oklahoma activity will be overwhelmingly concentrated in the oilier areas of the plain, including the Springer formation where we plan to leverage our own operated success in addition to our learnings from others. In the Northern Delaware, we are protecting our leasehold delineating our position and improving our margins, all while delivering significant early development drilling success.","Specifically, we saw our upper Wolfcamp wells in Malaga deliver an average IP30 of 340 BOED per lateral foot. As further evidence of our improving margin profile, Our cash costs were down 10% sequentially during second quarter. 100% of our produced water was on pipe and our oil on pipe is at 70% and rising.","Stepping outside of our four US resource plays, our commitment to portfolio optimization, continued with our international portfolio now streamlined to our free cash flow generating integrated business in EG. With the two most recent country exits from Kurdistan and the UK, we have reduced our asset retirement obligation from $2 billion in 2014 to less than $200 million today.","In summary, second quarter was truly exceptional with every asset contributing to our bottom-line success. And while we are frustrated by market volatility and by our sectors Equity underperformance. We believe in our strategy and our framework for success. And within that context, we will focus on what we control, which is our execution, and the consistent delivery of compelling bottom-line financial and operational outcomes quarter after quarter.","Our challenge is less E&P and more S&P, we must deliver financial results that are competitive with the broader market and that are attractive to both generalist, as well as energy investors. While many speak aspirationally on this point Marathon Oil is already competing in this broader space with year-to-date annualized free cash flow yield of 5% and 8% annualized free cash flow yield since 2018.","And since the beginning of 2018, we have returned around $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through our peer competitive dividend and disciplined buybacks equating to over 10% of our market value and representing about 25% of our operating cash flow. All funded entirely by organic free cash flow generation. Consistently superior financial results coupled with shareholder-friendly actions will over time be rewarded in the market.","As we look ahead to 2020 and beyond our conviction in our framework for success is unchanged. There won't be any surprises, corporate returns first, sustainable free cash flow at conservative pricing, returning cash to shareholders and differentiated execution. High-value oil growth will be an outcome of our rigorous multi basin capital allocation, not an objective. Importantly, our 2019 plan already has us well-positioned for both operational momentum and capital efficiency going into 2020.","We are delivering against our framework, this is our 6th consecutive quarter of post dividend organic free cash flow. Our capital discipline and our peer leading enterprise breakeven are a powerful and winning combination across a wide range of commodity environment. Thank you all for listening and with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase. Arun, are you there? Arun is your line muted?","Lee Tillman","You can move to the next question James.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs. Brian are you there? Is your line muted? Let me -- we might have a problem here. Let me check with the next one. Scott Hanold of RBC. Okay. Let me restart the Q&A queue and perhaps that will take care of this. Okay Arun, are you there? JPMorgan Chase? And Brian Singer? Let me try one more time. Arun are you there?","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Can you hear me?","Operator","Yes, I can. Go ahead, please.","Arun Jayaram","Sorry about the gentlemen there is a little bit of technical issues on our end, so apologies about that. But let me begin with my question. Okay. Lee, it's obvious that the Board's action indicates the free cash flow will be plowed back into buybacks. I did want to get your perspective regarding public market acreage valuations in the Permian, which are now well below historical average transaction levels including your entry in the basin and just your general thoughts on portfolio enhancement, just given the wide disparity in public market valuations relative what we've seen recently in the asset market?","Lee Tillman","Yes. well, first of all, good morning and apologies to everyone for the technical difficulties hopefully we're back on track. You're exactly right, Arun. I think that the re-authorization to the $1.5 billion mark by the board signals a strong intent for us to continue to deploy free cash flow into share repurchases. And again, fundamentally it's driven by the returns that we see there based on the current valuation of our share price. It's something that we'll continue to look at over time. We continue, of course, to have a dividend yield sitting around 1.5% which is very competitive within our direct peer group.","I think on your broader question about the market and where things are valued currently, I think, first of all, you have to recognize that might be the value from a market perspective, but in terms of what might actually transact could be very, very different from that. We remain very focused, though, as we always have been in those core -- our four core areas looking for those unique opportunities that fit our acreage position hand in glove.","So we're very mindful of small bolt-ons and as well as trades that can continue to help to build out our position, make it more contiguous increase our working interest, give us more optionality for a longer laterals. So that is front and center and I think as we continue to see this dislocation in the market. We want to be opportunistic and I think that's one of the reasons that we want to continue to protect the strength of our balance sheet, such that we can be opportunistic and that we can act quickly if the correct opportunity, in fact, does present itself.","Arun Jayaram","Great, great and just my follow up. Lee, the results from the Bakken have been relatively volatile for the industry there has been some gas processing headwinds that have impacted some of the mid-gap players in the basin. It seems like you were able to successfully navigate some of these headwinds, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on what drove call it the differentiated performance and how you set up in the Bakken for the rest of the year from a gas processing standpoint.","Lee Tillman","I'll start off by just saying that first, we remain fully compliant with the gas capture requirements in the state of North Dakota and we don't expect any impact going forward on our business plans or the associated oil production. I can't comment on the issues that other operators may be having I think everyone has a unique position in the basin. It is a little frustrating for us though to perhaps be painted with the same brush.","I think we have established a pretty strong credibility in the Bakken on delivering against our commitments there. When you look at almost any metric, it's hard not to argue that we have a very unique position there as a best in basin operator.","So, we continue to see the Bakken as a key element of our portfolio. I think you saw that performance this quarter sequentially Bakken oil was up nominally low over 10%. So it's all about planning your business and getting ahead of the curve on some of these things that could in fact the bottlenecks in the future. And so, our team is very diligent about assessing our takeaway and our ability to -- again, to be fully compliant with the regulations there and I think that planning has put us in a very good stead.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot. Lee","Operator","Okay . Our next questioner is Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Brian loud and clear.","Brian Singer","All right, Great. I'm going to start in the Eagle Ford. First can you speak to the cadence that you expect in drilling completing and bringing wells online there as we go forward and the impact that that has sequentially on production. And then could you also address decline rates that you're seeing from some of your older wells beyond the first 90 day to 180 days and how that impacts your assumption on terminal decline rates in the Eagle Ford.","Lee Tillman","Let me maybe start off with just some high-level commentary about cadence in general, we generally tend to talk about that more at and a portfolio level. Brian and then perhaps I'll let Mitch just chime in with a little bit more color on the Eagle Ford itself. We are spot on our development capital budget halfway through the year.","We always communicated that we were going to be a bit front-end weighted from a wells to sales standpoint. But I also want to stress that gross Company-operated wells to sales is not necessarily a perfect proxy for development capital spend. And as we look forward into the second half of the year, we know that there are going to be some factors as we look into the second half of the year, including, of course, the fact that we're going to see a little bit longer lateral links. We're going to see a little bit higher working interest in some of our key basins. So that will be impacting it. Also, we are trending toward the -- I would say the upper end of our overall wells to sales guidance.","Additionally, even the wells to sales are down in the second half of the year, actually drilling activity is increasing and specifically, we've added a rig in the Bakken. So there are a lot of factors that go into the second half of the yea Development capital spend. I would also though from a momentum standpoint point you to our guidance from a production volumes perspective and just say when you look at our 3Q guidance now in addition to our full-year guidance, it should become I think pretty straightforward that we continue to grow strongly 2Q to 3Q and, of course, going into 4th quarter that volumetric guidance moderates a bit, but we're finishing the year very, very strong and with our activity as designed. We expect to carry quite a bit of operational momentum and capital efficiency into 2020.","Perhaps, I'll turn it over. Mitch, just to maybe make a few comments just about the performance and the Eagle Ford, which quite frankly has been pretty extraordinary this quarter.","Mitch Little","Yes, Brian, just maybe a couple of additional points. All of the things that Lee described around the portfolio in general, would certainly apply to the Eagle Ford as well in terms of both cadence and some growing working interest and longer lateral lengths as we move into the second half of the year. It's exactly as we had it planned as you're well aware, we've significantly upgraded the performance across the Eagle Ford and extending Tier 1 into the overwhelming majority of the play.","Eight years in we're delivering record IP30s including the Gonzales County wells in a significant numbers outside of Karnes, what we see and tracking year-by-year programs with more long-dated production is very similar performance on an upgraded basis and as with all of these fields as we continue to grow the base production from prior year development, we're all aware that first year declines are relatively steep in unconventionals but as the base grows and as the magnitude of that prior year program grows, it has a dampening effect over the longer term in terms of shallowing the decline.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is a bit more on the capital allocation on exploration versus inorganic opportunities and realize there is not a resource exploration update this quarter but can you talk philosophically, perhaps to how you're thinking about the budget for research exploration in 2020. Higher versus lower assuming similar commodity prices to today and whether to the degree there is something you want to be opportunistic about whether that's a nod to turn.","Lee Tillman","I think when we talk about continuing to improve and enhance our resource base. We always talk about it in terms of really there's three buckets there that we are pursuing and investing in the first of those is organic enhancement and we've talked a lot about that aspect in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. The second element is really around small bolt-ons and trade.","Some of the things that we're doing in Northern Delaware, for instance. And then the third element, like you said, is in fact our resource play exploration program, it's that program for us. Offers the ability to get in at to greenfield leasing positions at a cost that allows us to really generate those outsized full cycle returns. But it does require constancy of purpose in a commitment, both in terms of talent as well as a financial resource.","We continue to talk about the REx program is being nominally a couple of hundred million dollars a year that's going to ebb and flow as activities and opportunities present themselves. Some years we may see heavier spend and exploration drilling and seismic, other years it may be more biased toward leasing, which was exactly the case that we saw last year as we established our position and the Louisiana Austin Chalk. But it's obviously a bit early to talk about 2020 budget. But I think the guidance that we provided this year around the REx program going forward that it's a much more ratable couple of hundred million dollars a year that still consistent with our current thinking.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next questioner is Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold","Thanks, good morning.","Lee Tillman","Good Morning.","Scott Hanold","First, I want to commend you all on basically supporting your stock with buyback, especially with where your equity prices, I mean certainly that's I think a great thing to see. Lee, you had made a point that investing in buybacks right now provides a very competitive. I mean, your portfolio. And can you tell us about like your thought at this point in time, with the increased buyback authorization, would you Envision getting a bit more aggressive on short-term -- buybacks in the short term, given where the stock prices or would you still be a little bit more patient and wait for the free cash flow to support that?","Lee Tillman","Our fundamental principle and we, of course, have had this dialog with our Board as well is really wrapped around our share repurchases are going to be governed by our ability to generate organic free cash flow. We are not going to spend money on share repurchases that we have not earned. And we also believe that dollar averaging and taking advantage of that overtime is the appropriate way to execute against a share repurchase program. So you should expect us to the extent that we are generating free cash flow, that we're going to put that to work in our share repurchase program, but it is going to be governed by organic free cash flow generation.","Scott Hanold","Understood, appreciate that. And my follow-up is on EG obviously internationally, you guys really have streamlined things. And I certainly, I think as you go into 2021 and beyond. It looks like that's going to bean opportunity kind of be I guess upside optionality with the new tolling agreement. Can you give us some context of like what that can mean in terms of like the size of incremental cash flow to Marathon?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I can probably give some directional views on that, we can't give specifics today on exactly the impact that will have on EBITDAX, but what you should expect is that we're going to continue to give full transparency on the financial delivery out of the EG assets so that it's very clear what that asset is doing within the broader portfolio. And even though it is a long life, low decline asset, meaning the Alba field itself with the addition of the Atlanta arrangement, which is a combination of tolling and profit sharing. There is certainly an opportunity to continue to drive financial performance there even off the back of non-equity molecules.","And as we've stated before. We believe that the arrangement that we have with Aland [Phonetic] is simply a first step, a fully leveraging that extremely valuable infrastructure that we have sitting on Bioko Island, which of course, is a gas plant, methanol plant LNG plant storage loading etc. And we believe that it will in fact fulfill the promise of kind of a natural aggregation point for both regional and local gas in that area, which will continue to bring additional profitability to the EG asset.","Scott Hanold","Okay, I appreciate that. Look forward to hearing more on that.","Operator","Our next questioner is Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me. Lee?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Absolutely. Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Good to see you, looking forward to seeing in a couple of weeks.","Lee Tillman","Got you.","Doug Leggate","Lee, the comment you made about S&P 500 had been one of your aspirations, I guess, been able to compete against that. There a little caveat there I guess, which is visibility on dividend growth and capacity for dividend growth, you've obviously growing the inherent cash flow of the organization. But you're continuing to emphasize the buyback over perhaps sustainable dividend growth.","I'd just like to know how you think about the balance between the two. Just in terms of that relative metric because free cash flow is certainly competitive but dividend growth is the other piece of the S&P 500 metric. How do you think about that?","Lee Tillman","Well, I think you rightly point out Doug that the first step is sustainable generation of free cash flow and let's be honest we are not an industry that's been doing that on a regular basis. I mean, this is our 6th quarter of achieving that because you can't have a conversation about returning cash to shareholders unless you're actually generating free cash flow.","So the first step is having a model -- a business model in a portfolio that consistently and sustainably delivers that free cash flow yield, once you get your yield to where you are competitive, then you're simply talking about the best mechanism to deliver that cash back to shareholders. Today, we very much favor the share repurchase because of the volatility in the market and where we sit from a value perspective on our shares, relative to our, I'll say, our own internal NAV calculations.","So we truly believe that with our returns first had on that is the right answer for shareholders. That split, that mix between dividend and share repurchase is something that we will continue to assess each and every quarter and we'll look at it and make a thoughtful decision about how to continue to balance that mix.","Today again, we're sitting at about 1.5% yield on the dividend, we think that is truly competitive within the peer group, it's clearly part of your cost structure moving forward in time. So you have to be very mindful, and patient about how you continue to ramp into the dividend, but at the end of the day, I believe that our ability to essentially return over 90% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in one form or another, that's really the most important metric. And I will also emphasize that return of cash to shareholders is a metric on my scorecard as well.","Doug Leggate","That's a very good point. Maybe just a quick follow-up to that. So assuming your share price was let's be aspirational and see it go back to where we all thought it was reasonably valued your dividend yield would obviously be not competitive because it would be significantly lower, would we expect the pivot to the dividend at that point?","Lee Tillman","I think -- at that stage, I think that's a very valid consideration it's clearly going to be based on what we see in the market and, and do we have that sustainability to take that step forward in the dividend? But yes, I mean, it's absolutely on the table as part of the mix. It's just today it's -- we saw the returns are so overwhelming for us on the flip side of that equation. And then you factor in the inherent volatility of the forward curve, right now and I think it just lends itself to the share repurchase as the best mechanism to get value back to our shareholders.","Doug Leggate","But last one from me if I'm thinking, that's part one A part one B. So, hopefully -- last one real quick is you inherited a fairly onerous contracts in EG as it relates to the British Gas off take agreement, which expires in a couple of years. What -- how should we expect the cash flow from EG to evolve once you gain that control of destination if you like for the off take and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yeah, we'll certainly -- that contract and that agreement was put in place at a time --at a different time. So I don't want to go back and hindsight that but what I will say is it going forward as that agreement runs its course, we absolutely can go out and get full market exposure and we think through that we'll have the opportunity to continue to enhance the profitability of the EG asset.","Doug Leggate","Great stuff. Thanks so much.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And next is Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, guys. Great answer so far. My questions first just pertaining to your Permian. Could you speak, there has obviously been increased scrutiny there on just how people are looking at spacing not only just in terms of per zone. But I guess can you talk about multi-well, multi-zones and I'm just wondering, could you talk a bit about what you think about your development plans remainder of this year and next year in terms of multi-zone targets and spacing?","Mitch Little","Sure. Neal, this is. Mitch. Probably not going to spend a lot of time on 2020 is we haven't set our capital program for 2020. But I think we've been pretty consistent with our messaging around our focus in Permian, which is kind of strategically pacing our investments to both delineate the position and move into development in areas like Malaga where we've reported on the upper Wolfcamp continued strong productivity. We've had a fair bit of focus in that area over the past few quarters. We also revealed in the slides as we move into the second half of the year, there was a bit stronger component of delineation over into the Red Hills area.","In the backdrop of all of that, of course, we're focusing on improving our margins with getting water and oil on pipe or up to 80% of our water on pipe driving cost structure down, capturing efficiencies from various completion trials and drilling programs across that position. So it's right on track, we're executing the plan that we expected to in early, when we set the budget early this year.","And so it's going to continue to be in the near term, more of that mix between some localized development in areas like Malaga, upper Wolfcamp and then the delineation element across the position as we move towards maturing into more full-field development. We do have trials in multiple benches as part of that delineation program, but the concentration has been more in the upper Wolfcamp and some other Wolfcamp and Bone Spring zones.","Neal Dingmann","Very good. And then could you talk a bit about maybe Lee, I guess my question is sort of a broader one there has been some reallocation out of the Mid-Con by a few players. I'm just wondering, really when you look at you have obviously some very great basins. I'm just wondering, is it purely just when you look at your development plan, just purely return driven. And I guess that's one and would you consider some reallocation out of that like others or how do you sort of -- how does that Mid-Con play of your stack up versus the others?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Well, absolutely, which is going to be all about returns for us and how we allocate and just maybe as a little bit of a reminder backing up to our original budget allocation that we talked about earlier in the year just recall 60% of our development capital is going to the Eagle Ford and the Bakken about 40% to Northern Delaware and Oklahoma. Having said that, our original Oklahoma program was really designed to concentrate activity in the oilier parts of both the STACK and the SCOOP because those offer the advantage of more competitive returns.","In addition, this kind of targeted development also allowed us to really bear down on completed well cost to continue to enhance our capital efficiency and we've demonstrated that case in point. The print that we just made on the completed well costs for the last two STACK Meramec pads where we are getting these wells done for basically $6.3 million. And so as we kind of take that and even look at the second half of the year, our Oklahoma activity again is going to be overwhelmingly concentrated in the oilier areas of the play, including the Springer.","And again, that is all driven by our returns orientation in our view is those opportunities obviously compete head to head with the other aspects of our portfolio. When I don't believe anticipated some of the headwinds in the secondary products which for certain of the phase windows and Oklahoma do, in fact, have a pretty significant issue, but I just point to this and say, this is part of our multi-basin advantage if we see the need to move capital, we have a lot of flexibility to do so.","Neal Dingmann","Great details. Thanks, Lee. Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","Okay. Our next question David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Thanks a lot of time thinking about the last six quarters of building a track record and I do think that's commendable and is eliminating uncertainty for investors. As I listen to some of the earlier questions and really trying to think about the intent. I think they're trying to eliminate uncertainty around the comfort you have of your existing portfolio versus acquisition?","And can you talk about like the dividend could be locked in very simply, but it seems like you're leaving yourself flexibility, which I understand, can you just talk about your existing portfolio, your existing stock price and your thought process of how much time Marathon people spend on looking at site acquisition?","Lee Tillman","I think, David, first of all, I think with our very extensive portfolio transformation and what we believe is a differentiated position in the four best US resource plays, large scale M&A is not really a consideration for us nor is it really required for forward success. So I think that multi-basin model gives us a lot of competitive advantages that we've talked about before. So the hard work for us, particularly with the exit from the UK and Kurdistan the hard work on the portfolio is really behind us not in front of us.","And we believe the right approach as we again look to continue to enhance and grow our resource base going forward is the one that I've already addressed, which is, it really comes into looking at enhancing what we already have, which could be elevating the economics or even adding incremental sticks and our in the basins that we currently operate. But it's also looking at smaller accretive bolt-ons that fit within the our kind of core basins as well as trades, even lease sales like we participated in, in New Mexico last year.","And then finally, the third element of that is really our REx program which albeit it's risk money we have to get out there and expose some money from a lease standpoint on things that are truly exploration. There are no guarantees in it, but we think we've got the right approach there and that we will generate success there as well. So I think the bottom line is we've got a very comprehensive strategy in place to continue to replenish and improve our resource base. And that does not require really large scale M&A.","David Heikkinen","And just following on that, your slide number five shows your free cash flow. But to the right of the line is REx, CapEx and A&D net, as you think about enhancing the portfolio versus organic or total free cash flow a couple of hundred million dollars indirect year, you could use up that free cash flow pretty quickly with the accretive bolt on trades and lease sales. So how do you think about that flexibility and outlook for repeatability of building on the track record?","Lee Tillman","I think, first of all, it obviously is highly dependent upon the commodity price environment that we find ourselves in, I think that our focus on continuing to drive our enterprise breakeven down as low as we can and really having that mindset of continuing to drive that breakeven even lower. It gives us that headroom to continue to operate to meet all of those needs to generate free cash flow across a very broad range of commodity price outcomes.","And then we can redeploy that as we see fit between not only returns back to shareholders but also funding some of these accretive opportunities and Resource Capture which could be rec some years, could be bolt-on some years and it's just really striking that balance and selecting the best opportunities. So we're going to have the most meaningful impact on our business.","Operator","Our next question from Jamaal Tudor of Tudor Pickering & Holt.","Jamaal Tudor","Good morning, everyone.","Lee Tillman","Good morning.","Jamaal Tudor","As I kind of listening on the commentary for second half of the year. Mentioning kind of longer laterals and higher working interest, is there any color you could give on the magnitude of working interest increase, we could see as I look at some of the charts, it looks like Q1 and Q4 are relatively low on working interest, but it snap back a little bit in Q2. Should we expect something kind of similar to the Q2 trajectory or something higher?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, well, certainly the way I would think about, Jamal, is that directionally, certainly and in some of our basins where we do have relatively high capital allocation We are going to see materially higher working interest in those basins, so that does make a difference. And again I don't want to get into basin by basin specifics and we can certainly follow up with you on that. But that is a driver, I would also remind you that beyond working interest in lateral link the fact that we have been very efficient, and we are trending toward the higher end of our wells to sales will also be an element of that as well.","Jamaal Tudor","All right fair enough. And as I look at some of the moving pieces in the second half of the year, it looks like the Springer is going to get some attention, which is much oilier then Oklahoma region and you're moving a little bit of dip in Gonzales, which could be oilier than the average Eagle Ford as well. I just wanted to get a sense of just kind of overall, are there any moving pieces on oil cut that we should be expecting in the second half of the year.","Lee Tillman","Certainly, it's a metric that we watch very closely because of that is our high-value product. That's what's really the key to delivering our financial outcomes. So I would say, directionally we're going to continue to try to keep that if not flat certainly improving over the second half of the year, particularly in those basins, like you said, in Oklahoma, where we have a well-mix that is going to allow us to drive a little bit more oil cut.","In places like obviously the Bakken to some extent, the oil cut is relatively fixed regardless of the well mix. And Eagle Ford, however, as you pointed out, as we continue to do more and up-dip Atascosa County as well as Gonzales there is the opportunity to continue to move that toward a higher oil cut.","Jamaal Tudor","All right, thank you.","Operator","Next question is Jeanine Wai of Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning everyone.","Lee Tillman","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai","Good morning, so my question, I only have one, my question is on level loading and the consistent free cash flow that you spoke about regarding needing that to support dividend growth. So if we go back to original 2019 plan in the US, the Bakken and the dollar objectives both include a growing oil and the Eagle Ford is more in harvest mode with you doing actually more with less given efficiencies but we suspect the Eagle Ford oil growth this year as well.","But can you talk about if and when it's appropriate for the Bakken and Delaware and Oklahoma to be run with a more level loaded type program like in the Eagle Ford in which perhaps you could enhance what we already considered to be a pretty free cash flow -- pretty strong free cash flow story. So our guess is just, you know the Bakken is closest to get into this maybe level loaded type of scenario. But we just wanted to check in on the longer-term view of how you're thinking about running the assets.","Lee Tillman","Yeah, well, certainly. First of all Jeanine, we manage our assets as a portfolio, not as individual assets. All of our assets have the capability to cycle between growth and higher free cash flow generation each of them have that implicit flexibility. So we start our capital allocation process with a view of driving a rate of change in our corporate-level returns.","The next really objective is to drive sustainable free cash flow on a conservative price deck and then quite frankly the oil growth that pops out of that is an outcome, not an objective. And so I would just say that it's a bit too early for us to give specifics around 2020. But I would just emphasize that all of the basins can make that flex and it's really going to be around delivering our financial metrics on how we actually allocate capital within those 4 basins.","Some like for instance this year Eagle Ford is a great example of the year where we generally speaking managed Eagle Ford relatively flat. So it was in a very high free cash flow generation mode. In the case of Bakken for instance, it was being managed to growth but was also generating significant free cash flow. And so each of the basins will have a particular role based on what we need to drive our financial outcomes at an enterprise level. So I would say there is no -- I'd say, rule in effect on when we're trying to get a given basin to some terminal production or plateau level.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Yeah. I guess my point was that at least listening to the commentary and some of the investor feedback is that the volatility in oil prices prevents companies like oil and gas, companies like you guys in terms of having a bigger dividend growth model. And so you can control oil prices, but you can control your free cash flow and dampening the volatility oil prices is if you kind of enhance the free cash do that. So we are just kind of wondering, how you're thinking about that.","Lee Tillman","I think what I would say on that Jeanine is that what we have tried to focus on is really driving our enterprise breakeven as low as practical, such that we can operate across the broadest spectrum of commodity prices, while still generating sustainable free cash flow. I mean we're well sub 50 in terms of our enterprise breakeven this year and with that sub 50 enterprise breakeven. We're still growing our overall MRO Oil by 10% and our US Oil by 12%. So I think it's, obviously, it's an optimization process but it starts with the financial objectives first and foremost.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you that's very helpful.","Operator","And our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. In highlighting the free cash flow metrics. I'm curious if you can disaggregate where that free cash flow is coming from and in particular, if this year you guys end up doing maybe 300 million, 400 million of free cash, how much of that is coming from EG?","Lee Tillman","The way I would think about level is that when you look across our asset base -- the strong free cash flow generators are Bakken, Eagle Ford and EG all of those are contributing strongly to free cash flow generation, because Oklahoma still early in the development cycle. It is still probably a little bit of a cash-taker to neutral. And then, of course, Northern Delaware still being on the delineation and appraisal phase is at this point, still cash flow negative as we continue to build the base production and gain of scale there.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, that's helpful. Is E.G the largest contributor?","Lee Tillman","No, it is not.","Pavel Molchanov","In barrel terms","Lee Tillman","No, it's not","Pavel Molchanov","It is not. Okay. Your balance sheet you highlighted investment grade from all of the rating agencies are you happy with the current level of ratings, just kind of on the gasp of investment grade or would you like to get further up into maybe single-A territory?","Lee Tillman","Well, I'll maybe make an opening comment then let Dane jump in. First of all, we're very pleased that we were the first split rated E&P company to get upgraded. Then, we, subsequent to the Moody's upgrade, we got an S&P upgrade from triple B-minus to triple B which has strengthened our investment grade rating. Obviously, that brings benefits to it that we can now enjoy.","But for us we don't do things in order to necessarily drive ratings, we tried to do the right things to drive the business and we look at key metrics like net debt to EBITDAX that really help us determine the overall health of our balance sheet and we're also looking to make sure that we maximize the flexibility that we have. But I'll maybe let Dane jump in and throw anything else that he would like.","Dane Whitehead","Yes, thanks Lee. I'd say we're very happy with the fact that we're investment grade rated at all three agencies work really hard on accomplishing that really everything that we've talked about today. Focusing on corporate level returns, generating free cash flow, driving down costs, increasing well productivity, it's all in terms of -- its more financial strength. And so I think rather than push on some key metric accelerated to see if we can get to another notch upgrade from the ratings agencies, we're just going to keep focused on executing business exactly in the model that we've described to you and that's going to support the credit quality and the rating support with the agencies. They really like the model we're executing.","Lee Tillman","I would maybe, also add that we took a lot of balance sheet action back in 2017. I think we're a little bit ahead of the curve there. We took out quite a bit of gross debt really reduced our interest cost, etc. all of that contributes to the strength of our balance sheet as well as to our enterprise breakeven. And so we got well out in front I think of the balance sheet question because we knew that financial flexibility was going to be important in the kind of forward commodity environment.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. We turn the call now back to Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.

I too would like to welcome you to Marathon Oil Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings webcast and teleconference. On the call today with me are Clarence Cazalot, Executive Chairman; Lee Tillman, President and CEO; and Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and the call will include forward-looking information. As we\u2019ve changed the format with the prepared remarks been issued last night, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in that slide deck, along with the period of SEC filings including our 10-K, 10-Q\u2019s and other filings, which provide additional risk factors.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to ask you to block out an important date on your calendar.

And let me add my good morning and welcome again to our second quarter earnings call. Prior to opening up for your questions, I\u2019d like to share just a few thoughts as the new President and CEO for Marathon Oil. One caveat today represents my seventh official day in my new position, so my remarks should be taken in that context.","First, let me reiterate what an honored is to be assuming this leadership role for what is by every measure an outstanding company. I appreciate the confidence placed to me by Clarence and Marathon Oil Board, and look forward to earning the confidence of our employee and shareholders as well.","In 2011, Marathon Oil began a journey to become the leading independent oil and gas producer. Clarence and the leadership team put forward a compelling vision that will enhance our focus on our E&P objectives and strategy, that would create transparency for our stakeholders and our employees, that would provide clarity on portfolio management and risk tolerance, that would also establish the business imperative around agility and a bias toward action, and finally, bring a relentless focus to long-term shareholder value and competitive returns.","All of this supported by our steadfast commitment to the core values of safe, health, environment, security, business ethics and corporate citizenship, and our traditional strength and operational excellence and large scale energy project development.","We are focused on the fundamentals that will grow our volumes profitability, access the high quality material resource, selectivity, and development and capital allocation, execution and operational excellence, continuous improvement through rigorous external and internal benchmarking.","We recognize that our most critical allocation decision is the deployment of human capital -- our employees, and we must continue to attract, retain and develop the best professionals in the industry to provide the necessary competency and leadership that will drive business performance and ensure that Marathon will continue living our values. ","Our focus on core values, profitable volume growth and investing in people will delivery long term value to our shareholders. A strategy that encompasses a base with strong cash flows, growth assets that leverage our strength, high impact exploration to open new opportunities, rigorous portfolio management to ensure robust capital allocation and financial discipline all combined to provide competitive returns for the long term. We are early in our journey as an independent E&P company but the results today are compelling and set the stage for the future. ","With that, I would like to hand back over to Howard who will facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you.","Howard Thill","Thanks Lee. Before we get started, two items. Number one, the transcript that was sent out last night had a rather large font. I apologize for that and (inaudible) but you can go to our website this morning and there will be a new transcript with a normal font that won\u2019t be printed out in 50 pages. So that\u2019s number one. Number two is that I would like to remind you to please keep your questions to two with associated follow-ups and by two questions you know who I am talking to, I don\u2019t mean multiple part questions. So with that Don, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks, good morning everybody and Lee, congratulations on your appointment. Two questions if I may. First of all on the Eagle Ford, so you\u2019re going to wait until December to give us down-spacing results. But for intention purposes I guess EOG and a lot of peers are pretty much already showing us what the asset can do. I guess my question on the down-spacing scenario you have a 10-year drilling inventory. Is that an inventory that you would want to accelerate going forward or is the current drilling pace optimal in your mind? And then I have a follow-up please.","Clarence Cazalot","Hey Doug, this is Clarence and I think you are right that others are more advanced perhaps in their overall understanding of the reservoir in terms of the potential for down-spacing and recognizing that the geology does change a bit across even the core of the Eagle Ford. I think it\u2019s important for us to do our diligence, to do the right technical work should we indeed to make the right capital allocation decisions as we indicated earlier.","I will say part of what you will hear I believe in December will be spot on relative to your question which is the issue of acceleration, we all recognize the value of acceleration. But at the same time as we\u2019ve spoken to before, it\u2019s very important that you\u2019re not outrun, certainly the capabilities to process transport market, the hydrocarbons are indeed outrun the capabilities of the overall industry infrastructure. So I think what you will see from us is the plan we believe optimizes the value of the resource we have there but does it in an appropriate way and is the right pace. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I may, my follow-up is -- I guess either of you two gentlemen in terms of the portfolio, currently you are leading the company with a great deal of cash flow, tremendous balance sheet but also an international declining asset base beyond the Eagle Ford, one could argue not a great deal of visibility. So I am just kind of thinking about how -- what\u2019s the next part of the story from Marathon, is that an acquisition story in terms of\u2026","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you feel as if you have the inventory to sustain the current visibility or how do you see using that cash and I\u2019ll leave it there?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Doug, hi. This is Lee, and thanks for the kind words. In terms of looking forward, Doug, I think we want to keep the opportunity aperture wide open. I think, we\u2019ve talked already about potential acceleration and the Eagle Ford, I would also add that probably applies to the Bakken as well.","We have a lot of running room in both of those areas. I think we will be able to talk more in depth about that in the December Analyst meeting that Howard has already mentioned. All of that work will be underpinned by the sound science that we\u2019re currently doing, certainly in the Eagle Ford on the downspacing pilots.","As we look more broadly, we are looking at high impact exploration wells in some key place around the world that would have the net effect of potentially strengthening our international portfolio.","Within our international portfolio of base asset, they are still strong performing assets. If you look at the uptime and reliability performance, clearly its top tier in the industry and those barrels are some of our most profitable barrels and we\u2019ll continue to look for incremental investments in those base assets.","In addition to that we remain open to acquisitions that make sense to our portfolio and we\u2019ll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions in North America that are going to be accretive to our overall portfolio.","So I think we have a lot of levers to pull to continue to drive the portfolio. We\u2019ll also continue to look at those assets that may no longer fit our portfolio. Most recently, of course, we announced the sale of the block in Angola and I think that\u2019s indicative of us continuing to high grade our portfolio and look to develop a very competitive portfolio in our peer group.","Janet Clark","And, Doug, I would simply say, you\u2019re right, our international assets, particularly in the North Sea are declining, but you\u2019ll recognize that our overall 5% to 7% growth rate incorporates that decline. So indeed, we\u2019re managing that, as Lee said, these are assets that generate very significant cash flow that help fund, if you will, our domestic growth.","So, again, I would simply say, we recognize those declines, they\u2019re built into our projections and our projections don\u2019t include any acceleration, which indeed could enhance or increase even 5% to 7% if we believe that\u2019s the right thing to do.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys and again congratulations to you both.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. And my thanks to the new format of e-mailing out the prepared remarks the night before, didn\u2019t mind to find Howard, but regardless, I appreciate to get all that stuff at a time and just going straight to Q&A. Just a follow-up question\u2026","Clarence Cazalot","At least now, Arjun, you don\u2019t have to -- at least now Arjun you don\u2019t have to decide whether we\u2019re live or remember it\u2026","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Definitely cuts out that risk.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Just a few follow-up questions on the portfolio, you may not be able to comment on all of this, but there had been some reports about whether you continue to have an interest in Libya, if you can address that? On the Norway piece, I think the declines are meeting your expectations? Can you talk about things that you can do that can either alleviate that decline or is it just kind of normal course there? And then maybe for, Lee, comments on the oil sands which at various times have been talked about as a potential divesture candidate? How you\u2019re feeling about that asset? Thank you.","Janet Clark","Yeah. Maybe, first of all, with respect to Norway, Arjun, I think the declines thus far this year have been less than we expected and that has really helped drive stronger performance or strong results out of our international production side.","And again, I would attribute it, as Lee said earlier, very strong reliability, our teams are really outstanding in keeping those assets running at the optimum rate, but the reality is as we\u2019ve talked about before that asset is going to go into decline, it\u2019s the manage decline because we have a number of offsets satellite fields will tie-back, you know the Boyla project which is under development currently will come on-stream in the fourth quarter of 2014 all of which will begin to flatten that decline but nonetheless the decline.","But, again, as we\u2019ve discussed many, many times the Norwegian barrels are high revenue and very low cost -- cash cost and so very high strong cash margins despite a 78% tax rate but again that will be a portfolio decision we will have to make. And then I think with respect to Libya, as we have done with other assets that we are potentially reviewing we don\u2019t comment on specific assets that we may or may not. So again as we discussed that pushed us in an awkward position in terms of any negotiations we have or government approvals. So we prefer not to comment on that one.","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think it\u2019s important, Art, to know we recognize that we have delivered though on our asset high-grading commitments, we are at the upper end of the range of what we talked about in the past, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve completed that process. It\u2019s an ever-green process and as Clarence said, we don\u2019t comment specifically on Libya or oil sands but we do recognize that high-grading our portfolio is one of the tools that\u2019s available to us to continue to deliver competitive returns and we will continue to use that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Firstly, Clarence, wanted to congratulate you on a great career at Marathon. I had some questions on the buyback and I know in the prepared remarks you mentioned that the proceeds from Angola would primarily be used for buyback. So I was hoping you could give us little more clarity on how we should think about timing, do we need to actually have the deal closed before buybacks commence, should we be thinking more ratable purchases opportunistic and then if possible, any kind of real specifics on exactly how much of that will be allocated toward buybacks?","Clarence Cazalot","My questions, Blake, but I think all I would say at this point is that our expectation is the buybacks would be timed closer to when we get the proceeds. Now how it gets done, whether it\u2019s ratable or accelerated, those are all decisions that have to be made under evaluations but as we said, the largest part of the use of these proceeds will be for buybacks and so I think you should look to hear more about that in the coming months.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","My second question is on the exploration side, I know it sounds like that Sabisa had some positive indications but the delivery has moved off. Any indication of when you may get back on that target and then secondly, on Gabon, I know Total is the operator but just any indication of initial shows would be great.","Clarence Cazalot","I think on Sabisa, as you indicated that we did find indications of a working hydrocarbon system in this first well, it\u2019s the first well in this Miocene basin. So that\u2019s very encouraging. We had mechanical issues with respect to BOC, they really did analysis to get a full evaluation of that well. But rather than drill another well next to it, the decision was made to move into the center of the basin to drill the next well -- the Total well, to give us more information to assess the overall prospectivity of that basin. So again as we talked about any these rift basins, it really takes multiple exploration wells to get a full assessment of the potential and so that\u2019s what we are trying to do with this second well.","And then I think with respect to the [model] well in Gabon, Blake, I believe we said about all we can say at this point in the press release that we are at total depth and logging operations are underway in other evaluations. And again as those results are received and evaluated it will be up to the operator Total to announce those results. So that\u2019s about all I can say. To me it\u2019s a matter of weeks, not months that you will be hearing those results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","I guess two questions just on shale, first on the Eagle Ford, you\u2019ve discussed (inaudible) a decent well result. I think it\u2019s fair to say that [Austin shale] probably have the best rate in the industry just because of it\u2019s more choke in our shale decline rates, perhaps where other people have been drilling. Are there any comments you could make to help us understand why the Austin Chalk might be better with the acreage that you guys hold?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah. I guess, let\u2019s say, the comment we made back when we first entered, putting people questions some of the prices we paid, we said Eagle Ford is not the same across this entire area and that the same is true for the Austin Chalk. I think we\u2019ve talked in the past that when you look at the core data here in the primary, core part of the Eagle Ford here and you look at the Austin Chalk compared to the Eagle Ford, they look very, very similar. And certainly, I\u2019d say based on the wells we drilled so far, the production and the rates we\u2019ve gotten that seems to be the case.","They are much more Eagle Ford like in terms of their performance. It\u2019s early days. We\u2019ve got four wells. We\u2019ll look to continue to evaluate this and determine just how extensive this prospective Austin Chalk is. But when you think about the fact, these were shorter laterals than what we\u2019ve been drilling in the Eagle Ford and yet achieved pretty strong rates.","The performance so far kind of looks like the type curve for the condensate window in the Eagle Ford. So pretty strong performance, very encouraging and I think certainly upside to what we\u2019ve previously thought.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then on the Bakken, I mean, you\u2019ve got a target to go to sort of 50 to 60, you announced an intriguing Three Forks well. Obviously, you\u2019ve got some acreage that looks good and some other acreage that\u2019s further off-peak but what\u2019s the restriction on ongoing faster?","Clarence Cazalot","Well, that is certainly one of the things that Lee mentioned it earlier as we evaluated our business plans for 2014 and beyond. Acceleration is certainly an opportunity we have in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. And we\u2019ll be looking at that. Certainly, some of the past transportation bottlenecks have diminished.","We certainly see quite a bit of takeaway today, some more profitable than others. Rail is certainly no long the track that it was a few months ago. But we\u2019ll certainly look at the potential to accelerate our development of that and to your point, we have had good results in the upper Three Forks. And we\u2019ll continue to do some of the pilot work and additional valuation we need to look at the second and third ventures as well and begin to develop our plans for those additional zones.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons","Thanks and good morning.","Howard Thill","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Baber - Simmons","I understand it might be a little early for this question. But I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your early expectations for production growth in 2014. And I\u2019m basically just wondering if you see yourself able to grow with those long-term rates that you\u2019ve highlighted before to at least 5%. And how important is hitting that target for any individual year or are you just more concerned with the longer term production potential of the portfolio?","Clarence Cazalot","Guy, the 5% to 7% we gave was 2010 to 2017 and of course, we got the slide here in the deck to show what that looks like in terms of general magnitude. But for any given year, again it depends upon what projects we have coming on, how quickly we develop some of our assets.","With respect to 2014, our business planning process is getting underway now. As I\u2019ve indicated and Lee said as well, a good deal of what we do in the Eagle Ford will depend upon the results of the down spacing and again you\u2019ll hear about that in December.","And let me say this December Analyst meeting isn\u2019t just about the Eagle Ford. You\u2019ll be hearing about the entirety of our portfolio. So to the extent, we look at acceleration of the Eagle Ford, the extent we look at acceleration in the Bakken. Those would all be things that we would discuss at that time. And I would point to that, Guy, as to the time table in which we would give you guidance on 2014 production.","Guy Baber - Simmons","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up is you had some positive commentary around realizations about the Eagle Ford and was just hoping you could elaborate some of your more recent developments there about the new LLS contract, also some additional infrastructure, just maximizing net backs. So my question is, is there just more detail you could provide around your outlook for Eagle Ford realizations over the next couple of years. And any plans in place you might have to maximize those realizations?","Clarence Cazalot","Well, again I would just say we\u2019ve done a very good job, I think in terms of getting our infrastructure in place, moving our barrels off the trucks on to pipelines and allowing us to get to where we can realize the highest value for our crude. I know there has been a lot of commentary in the past about some of the weakening prices for condensate and NGLs and different gravities as we talked about before. We have about 72% of our liquids that we are realizing LLS minus $8 a barrel at the well head and about 28% that\u2019s LLS minus $12 a barrel. And that\u2019s all the higher gravities and the lower gravity we do a good job of blending as much as we can to stay below 55 degrees and again I think we are maximizing our commercial advantage in the Eagle Ford. ","The new contract we talked about is really a pipeline to sell into the enterprise line going into the Houston ship channel that frankly is LLS minus $6 a barrel at the wellhead. Our best realization to date in the basin. So our midstream teams, our commercial teams are doing a good job of staying out in front of our production growth and ensuring we are getting the best value for our barrels.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Malone from Mizuho Securities.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","It looks like you increased guidance a bit on North American operating costs. Can you just elaborate of what\u2019s behind that?","Clarence Cazalot","John, let us take a look at that and get back to you. I am not sure we -- but we will have to get back to you on that.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","And then second question, clearly you got a lot of news coming out of Kurdistan in the near future. How are your views on the politics they are involved and if you were successful and what would inform the decision between farming that down selling out of entirely versus sticking around and developing?","Clarence Cazalot","Well I think Kurdistan like all of our opportunities we are still on the very early days. We got to continue on operated blocks as well as to operated blocks, we are very early in the exploration phase. We are just getting the results. Clearly Kurdistan is a long play in terms of gaining material production out of Kurdistan. I think we need to see these latest exploration results and we will get some clarity around next step. It\u2019s a stellar hydrocarbon province and it\u2019s one of the plays that we need to be involved in. And once we get sufficient data we can take a view of how best to monetize the resource whether that is through our own operations or by some other means. But Kurdistan is still a very early days play for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Hi, this is just one for Clarence and somewhat expository, you\u2019ve been getting a lot of congratulations on the restructuring. I just have kind of a post-mortem question for you, Clarence. Clearly, Marathon today is a lot different than when it started. One, did you have revision to this type of radical transformation and specifically with upstream do you think a lot of your decisions were based on changes in technology more than resource access, could you kind of give a brief post-mortem as to that whole process?","Clarence Cazalot","You mean in terms of the rationale behind the split, John?","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","No, no, not the split, how you\u2019ve changed your E&P business. I mean it reduced your risk exposure for exploration, added a large exploitation compound or lake, I was just wondering how you envision portfolio versus when it came in, and ---","Clarence Cazalot","Well, I would simply say it\u2019s -- Lance Robertson said something to me yesterday about the last couple of years that he\u2019s watched me, he said, looks like I am having a lot more fun. And it really is. It\u2019s been a lot of fun running an E&P company and all the things we talk about is the advantages of a resource driven company in terms of lower risk, scalability, the ability to accelerate, indeed if you want the production in order to optimize value.","Frankly, that kind of detail that we\u2019re get into this call, really getting into the business, it to me is a great deal of fun. Lee has jumped in with both feed into this. You can imagine it\u2019s a little different than Exxon but it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s been absolutely right decision for the company. And I think we\u2019ve positioned the company well. We\u2019ve got a great deal of resource to the future and I would do it all over again, John.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks. Last one, a second one, how long is the Madagascar well?","Clarence Cazalot","Let\u2019s see here. We will get it for you here and will give that comment, John, on the line in just a moment.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","All right. Thank you.","Clarence Cazalot","You bet.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from Duane Grubert from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Duane Grubert - Susquehanna","Yeah. As we look forward to meeting you and your style, I was wondering if you could comment a little. If I was to suggest three buckets of style, one being a technical focus, one being the focus on numbers and one being a strategy. How do you see your style evolving at Marathon, what are your natural biases?","Lee Tillman","Well, certainly I began my career on the technical side of the business, no doubt playing in and of course, our business remains the technical business that still has to be based and driven on sound science. A great example of that is what we\u2019re doing in Eagle Ford with downspacing. We\u2019re being methodical but also aggressive in our approach to technology there.","I think though in terms of splitting that dimension versus the numbers of the financial side and the strategy side, I see needing to bridge across all three of those dimensions. You really can't separate the three. It\u2019s an integrated proposal here. At the end of day, it\u2019s really about risk management and capital allocation for us and really to do that adequately you have to have a focus on technical numbers as well as the guided by long-term strategy. So, I actually look forward to discussing all three with you in the future.","Duane Grubert - Susquehanna","Yeah. That\u2019s a great answer. And then just a related follow-up. What\u2019s your biggest ingoing surprise as an opportunity?","Lee Tillman","Well, I think, for me it just that the sheer of running room that exist in the resource play here in the U.S. It is a tremendous opportunity. We\u2019ve talked at length already about the Eagle Ford and the Bakken in the primary zones that we\u2019re chasing there, but we\u2019ve also talked about the Austin Chalk as well. There just an incredible amount of opportunity yet to be on lease, putting the downspacing even to the side, some of these stack place that exist, I think we\u2019re just beginning to understand.","I\u2019ve also been very impressed with how quickly Marathon has ramped up from an efficiency standpoint. We\u2019re still relatively early to the resource play that, as you look at the efficiencies and the reliability that our teams that driven in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, it\u2019s very impressive and certainly constitute first quartile performance and that\u2019s been a very pleasant surprise to me.","Duane Grubert - Susquehanna","Great. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Duane.","Speaker","Good answer John Herrlin's question the Madagascar well looks like about a 90-day well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Good morning, guys. Just a two quick questions for me. Something we get to talk a little bit about your Kenai drilling program and in particularly the Southern Kenai and how that fits into an acceleration case given the result you guys have seem today kind of how that, what commodity price environment you need to pick up drilling there?","And then secondly, just wanted to get an update on your views on the Lower Tertiary opportunity within your portfolio in the Gulf of Mexico? And how we should think about your drilling plans over the next year or two targeting some of those high impact prospects?","Janet Clark","Yeah. I think certainly in the, what we call the Knox area or it could be Southeast Kenai, we have two rigs operating today, that\u2019s been sort of steady stay just to cope on acreage, continue to advance our knowledge of the reservoir, continue to help drive down our drilling cost which is very important component for us, there is as we noted in the press release, one of our more recent well Fort Knox was a record for us in terms of drilling times, down to 43 days and a very strong IP rates. So it is indeed an area to go back to what we said before, we have a great deal of resource here across the Knox and Cana area proper to the north as well as other areas of Oklahoma. Right now we have a sort of go-slow strategy on, continue to advance our technical knowledge, continue to advance our drilling costs but significant opportunity to ramp up and that\u2019s what we show in our investment presentation is this is an area as we see, particularly higher NGL prices. Natural gas prices will help as well but to see NGL prices get back up into the high 40s well could be $1 a barrel type ranges would certainly be very helpful in terms of the economics of this area. But I think we can envision at some point in the future as we see better prices running double digit numbers of rigs in this area. We think the potential is quite significant. We are quite fortunate that a good deal of our acreage is HBP. So we don\u2019t have a compelling reason to be out there drilling wells just to hold a lot of acreage at this time.","And I guess with respect to Paleogene, we have a significant prospect inventories today and when you -- when we take delivery of the rig next year with Conical that we will share, that\u2019s when we will begin to execute on our operated Paleogene prospect inventories, the vast majority of which are in-board which as you know based on the [Shenadore] results the in-board Paleogene has much better reservoir properties and that\u2019s where our initial focus will be in our Gulf of Mexico drilling.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Howard Thill for closing remarks.","Howard Thill","Thanks Don. And before we close, I\u2019d just again like to remind you to please mark September 4th on your calendars for our analyst, as Clarence said for a total company review in San Antonio, Texas and we appreciate very much your interest in Marathon Oil and hope you have a wonderful day. Thank you. Good bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"13763":["Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  8, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","","Clarence P. Cazalot Jr. - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Janet F. Clark \t- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Howard J. Thill Sr. - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs","Analysts","","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Raymond James - Pavel Molchanov","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One","Roger Reed - Wells Fargo","","Howard Thill ","Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, Chairman, President and CEO and Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Slide two contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and subsequent Form\u2019s 8-K cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Please note in the appendix to this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for the periods presented as well as operating estimates and other data you may find useful.","Turning to slide three, beginning in 2013, we changed the company\u2019s reportable segments to better reflect the growing importance of our U.S unconventional resource plays. All periods presented have been recast in this new segment view. There are still three reportable operating segments, with each organized and managed based primarily upon geographic location and the nature of its products and services. The three segments are North American E&P which explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in North America and includes our in-situ position in Canada; International E&P which explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets liquefied natural gas and methanol; and Oil Sands Mining which mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil.","As discussed on slide 4, we also changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of income primarily to present additional revenue and expense details and to report certain expenses more consistently with our peers. To effect these changes, certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts were made and as a result, general and administrative expenses for the first and fourth quarters of 2012 increased by $39 million and $38 million respectively, offset by reductions in production, other operating and exploration expenses and taxes other than income. Full year 2011 and 2012, along with second and third quarter 2012 data will be added to future published documents. ","Slide 5 provides an analysis of cash flows for the first quarter 2013. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.6 billion, a 40% increase over the fourth quarter as a result of higher sales volumes, lower production cost per BOE and better U.S. liquids realizations particularly for Bakken crude. Proceeds from dispositions of $312 million almost completely offset the debt repayment of $314 million. While working capital changes resulted in a $73 million use of cash and we paid dividends of $120 million. We ended the quarter with $768 million in cash, $84 million higher than year-end 2012, while total debt was $6.5 billion bringing our net cash adjusted debt to capital ratio down slightly to 24%.","Slide six reconciles quarter-to-quarter adjusted net income. The first quarter 2013 was 7% lower than the fourth quarter 2012. Our North America E&P first quarter after-tax earnings decreased to $160 million, largely a result of a $218 million \u00a0after-tax unproved property impairment in the Eagle Ford. The first quarter 2013 effective tax rate was 73% or 65% excluding Libya. Slide seven shows the North America E&P segments first quarter 2013 earnings decreased from income of $101 million in the fourth quarter 2012 to a loss of $59 million in the current quarter. Again, this loss was primarily the result of the unproved property impairments I just discussed.","Lower natural gas prices and volumes driven by the disposition of the company's assets in Alaska were more than offset by higher production from the lower 48 resource plays and stronger crude prices in the lower 48, again particularly for the Bakken. Slide eight shows the changes driving our first quarter 2013 international E&P earnings. The segment income of $453 million in the first quarter was little changed from the $446 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2012. The first quarter saw an underlift in Libya driving a negative volume variance which was offset by lower income taxes. Higher DD&A was seen in the quarter as a result of first sales from Angola, which was offset by a positive variance in the other category as a result of higher earnings from our equity investments in EG and lower indirect cost because of employee bonus accruals in the fourth quarter 2012.","Slide nine shows quarter-over-quarter data for LNG and methanol sale. LNG sales volumes were higher as a result of an additional lifting in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, while methanol sales volumes were down slightly over the same period. Slide ten shows our oil sands and mining segment income increase $21 million sequentially, primarily because of higher volumes driven by reliability improvements. Combined production from the Jackpine and Muskeg River mines set a record at bitumen production rate in the first quarter. In addition, the upgrader availability was 100% for the first quarter, allowing the facility to maximize production of lighter synthetic crude which improved realizations and profit margins. This was partially offset by higher cost at the mine related to contract labor associated with seasonal activity.","I will now turn the call over to Clarence to discuss the operations.","Clarence Cazalot","Good morning. Slide 11 summarizes the key highlights for the first quarter. We had strong production growth and cash flow from operations. Our available for sale production was up 4% over the prior quarter and up 19% over the first quarter of 2012, excluding Libya and Alaska. We continued our focus on controlling our cash cost and this along with other factors led to a 40% increase in cash flow from operations before working capital changes. We continued our solid execution in the U.S. unconventional plays, particularly the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. And indeed, increased our 2013 production guidance in the Bakken to 40,000 BOE per day net.","We also increased our overall production guidance for 2013 for our worldwide operations to 7% to 10% growth over 2012 versus our prior guidance of 6% to 8%. Moving to slide 12. I will comment on our execution in our key resource plays and future expectations. Eagle Ford first quarter production averaged 72,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 22% increase over the prior quarter. The migration to pad drilling is ahead of schedule, with 80% of wells drilled in the first quarter drilled off multi-well pads. Our 2013 target for drilling between 215 and 250 net wells remains unchanged. We\u2019re currently operating 16 rigs and we\u2019ll continue to monitor rig efficiency in order to hit our targeted annual well count. We\u2019ve also began testing Austin Chalk and Pearsall formations within our acreage to assess their potential. ","Production in the Bakken averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first quarter. The strong performance of our asset team has allowed us to once again raise the 2013 targeted annual production to approximately 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The targeted 2013 well count of between 65 to 70 net wells remains unchanged. Approximately 45% of our oil production was transported to market via rail in the first quarter.","In the Oklahoma resource basin, our targeted 2013 well count of between 15 to 19 net wells remains unchanged. And during 2013, we will drill four wells to assess the potential resource within the Mississippian line and granite wash horizons. ","Slide 13 shows our 2013 refocused and very active exploration drilling schedule. The program has already resulted in the successful appraisal of the outside operated Shenandoah prospect in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. We\u2019re currently participating in eight exploration or appraisal wells and expect to evaluate the potential of this program over the next 12 months.","Slide 14 demonstrates since the first quarter of 2012, our quarterly worldwide production available for sale, excluding Alaska and Libya, has drawn approximately 18%. The growth wedge over this time was primarily driven by lower 48 onshore production.","Slide 15 shows that our lower 48 onshore production available for sale has drawn approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2011 to the first quarter 2013. Importantly, liquids volumes increased from 55% to 72% of total volumes over the same period. ","The 2013 first quarter production was 9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. The target for fourth quarter production is between 190,000 and 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is an increase from the 185,000 to 205,000 BOE per day range we previously provided.","Slide 16 shows the historical available for sale and sales volumes for the North America and international E&P segments, including Libya and Alaska since the first quarter of 2012. Production available for sale increased 16% and 2% over the first and fourth quarters of 2012 respectively. ","New production brought on stream in the first quarter of 2013 was partially offset by the sale of our Alaskan assets. Correspondingly, sales volumes in the first quarter were 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent, lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. However, if you exclude Libya and Alaska, sales volumes increased 19% and 4% compared to the first quarter and fourth quarter respectively.","At the end of the first quarter, we had a cumulative under lift of approximately 3 million BOE. Of this, approximately 2.2 million BOE is natural gas in Libya. On the liquid side, we are under lifted 1 million barrels in Libya and 166,000 barrels in Norway. We are over lifted 273,000 barrels in the UK, 78,000 barrels in Angola and 64,000 barrels in EG. The first quarter saw our first liftings from Angola.","Slide 17 compares total company liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, excluding Libya for the first quarter of 2012, fourth quarter 2012 and first quarter 2013. Actual sales volumes grew approximately 27% between the first quarter of 2012 and 2013, with the U.S percentage growing from 34% in the first quarter of 2012 to 42% in the first quarter of 2013.","Slide 18 shows the same comparison for actual first quarter 2013 to estimated second quarter 2013 sales volumes. U.S. sales continue to grow as a percentage of the total. Slide 19 shows our progress towards our stated goal of achieving a 5% to 7% compounded average growth rate between 2010 and 2017. The impact of the growth being delivered by our onshore U.S. plays is evident in this chart.","Slide 20 shows our international E&P quarterly cost structure per BOE. Our operated international production in Norway, Equatorial Guinea and the UK, maintained excellent reliability. DD&A per BOE in the first quarter of 2013 was impacted by our first liftings from Angola. Slide 21 depicts the international E&P cost per barrel of oil equivalent trend without Libya. By excluding the low cost Libya barrels, we see an increase in our overall cost per barrel compared to the prior slide. Slide 22 provides our estimate for the 2013 international E&P cost per barrel of oil equivalent, and this excluded Libya. The forecast reflects a combination of the projected decline in our Norway production and a continued ramp up of production from the non-operated Angola Block 31 PSVM development.","The higher operating cost per BOE also reflects the cost of turnarounds and workovers scheduled later in 2013. As shown on slide 23, total North America E&P cost per BOE increased quarter-over-quarter primarily because of higher exploration cost associated with the impairment of certain unproved leases in the Eagle Ford. But excluding the Eagle Ford impact, overall costs were lower than the fourth quarter and cash costs were lower by approximately $0.90 per BOE. Slide 24 provides the estimated 2013 operating cost per BOE for overall North America E&P and the Eagle Ford.","With that I will turn it back to Howard for the Q&A.","Howard Thill","Thanks, Clarence. And before I turn it back to Brandon, I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to two questions along with follow-ups, clarifications, so we can get everyone in the queue. And if we have time you can re-queue for additional questions. With that, Brandon, we will turn it over to you to open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) From Credit Suisse we have Ed Westlake on the line.

Just diving into a bit of the detail, and obviously we can all download data from the Texas Railroad Commission, but one of the things that you are doing is changing the completion design. I think you are operating certain frac spreads with an improved completion design and seeing some good results. As you look overall in the first quarter, can you give us some color of, say how many wells you completed? Where on the old design, how many on the design, so that we can sort of date your progress on IP rates against what you are doing in the wells. And if there is any color on longer laterals as well, that would be helpful.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, Ed, this is Clarence. I don\u2019t have that kind of detail to give you today. We will certainly look at --including some of that color as we put together or future investor presentations. But I think as you recall when we look at the investor presentations, we have been showing -- we have got a couple of slides in there that show the progress that we have seen, particularly in the Excelsior, East Longhorn and South Barnhart areas, comparing if you will, sort of our original completion design to what we have seen of late. And of course we have seen relative to the 30-day IP rates, anywhere from a 33% to a 75% improvement. And then we give greater detail by quarter in Excelsior where we show the improvement in the 30-day IPs, again where we have seen upwards of a 75%. I think we will continue to show that kind of improvement with our first quarter results. ","And I also know, Ed, you had had some questions about the state data perhaps not reflecting some of the higher rates that we have shown. We have to certainly look at and understand why the state data doesn\u2019t show certainly the results we are seeing. Part of it we believe is that the data is reported on a lease level rather than a well level. But we certainly when we look at some of our more recent wells, we\u2019re seeing rates of anywhere from 2,000 BOE per day to 3,800 BOE per day of which liquids or oil I should say ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 barrels a day. So really outstanding results, reflective I think of the improvements we\u2019re making in our completion methods. But we\u2019ll look to provide some of that additional detail and color going forward.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah, helpful color on those recent 24 hour IPs. Could you just update us on the well cost as well that you\u2019re running because I think service cost has built a little bit coming down.","Clarence Cazalot","It is and I think we are targeting a drilling and completion cost here in the second quarter of about $7.6 million per well and we see that trending down by the fourth quarter to about $7.2 million. On top of that drilling completion cost, you have about $600,000 per well of facilities cost. So we are seeing continued reduction in our costs. But  I think we\u2019ve extracted pretty good efficiencies out of our operations as well as cost improvements from some of our vendors.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Doug Leggate online. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Clarence, if I could maybe follow-up on Ed's question, over the last several quarters I guess, we've had discussions backwards and forwards about not so much the completions, but your operating philosophy as it relates to choke sizes and so on and my understanding was you're going to be experimenting with that somewhat. So I'm wondering if you can provide us an update as to whether or not you've decided to open these things up a little more aggressively in the early days.","Clarence Cazalot","Well, again I think the choke management, Doug, is one of the outcomes that will provide more guidance on when we\u2019re through with the pilot testing. The pilot testing as you know is both lateral spacing, vertical placement and certainly completion methods to include choke size. So, more detail to come on that. But I would simply say that I think we continue I would say to remain a bit on the conservative side at this point of not opening these wells up. And we continue to believe stress dependent permeability is an issue out here and we\u2019d rather constrain the early flow rates and enhance recovery as opposed to opening the wells up and getting higher initial rates. So again more detail to come on that I think as we -- in the second half of the year we provide guidance on the results of the pilot program and what it really means if you will in terms of the wells that we\u2019ll drill, the resource and how we\u2019ll best complete these wells.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. My follow-up is somewhat unrelated.  I guess you reported the first region exploration results. I'm guessing that didn't quite come in as you expected. My question is, if Norway exploration doesn't work, you've got obviously a big organization in Norway, what is the prognosis for Norway as a core asset for Marathon going forward? I'll leave it at that. Thanks. ","Clarence Cazalot","I think as you recognize we have said pretty clearly that 2013 will be the year that we begin to see the decline in our Norway producing assets. Again the asset has outperformed our expectation in the first quarter. We\u2019ll continue to do what we can to maximize its recovery. But pretty clearly it is going into decline. Having said that, we continue to look for opportunities in and around Alvheim to extend the life of this asset and we\u2019ll continue to do so. We are hopeful that the exploration we do there in the third quarter is successful and that will give us an additional future development in Norway. But as you recognized this is an asset that generates very significant cash flow for us. It\u2019s an asset that I think is pretty clearly misunderstood by the investment community. I continue to see it referred to as low margin barrels. They\u2019re not low margin either on a earnings basis and certainly not on a cash flow basis and it\u2019s a very high return asset. And so I think it is an essential part of our portfolio today. There will be a point in time, obviously, when it reaches a certain level of production that we would look to divest of it and perhaps put in the hands of someone for whom it creates greater value. But at this point in time, Norway is a key producing asset and we believe it has upside.","Operator","From Raymond James we have Pavel Molchanov on the line. Please go ahead.","Raymond James - Pavel Molchanov","Can I ask one about Poland? Obviously you are not the first U.S. company to exit Poland, but I am curious how many wells you have drilled and other analytical work you have done before making that decision.","Clarence Cazalot","Pavel, let me just check. I want to say off hand, it's about 11 wells that we have drilled -- I am sorry, 6 wells that we have drilled. And we have done some testing there. And I would simply say that we believe the results are fairly conclusive. These wells were drilled across the extent of our 11 concessions. And basically what we found was thinner section than we anticipated and lower pressures which for the most part high pressures are pretty important in these unconventional plays. And after recognizing this was initial stage of exploration but costs are pretty high. And so we have come to a conclusion that while there may be some potential here ultimately, it certainly doesn\u2019t fit our criteria and as we have said, we are mobilizing to move out of our Poland concessions.","Raymond James - Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Appreciate that. And then another one about, \u00a0kind of in front tier opportunity you guys are pursuing in Kurdistan where you have had a fair amount of success already. You know what's the sequencing for moving into development mode on any of the blocks that you are currently working on?","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, we are in the process of preparing a plan of development on the non-operated Atrush Block. That plan of development will contemplate a development of initially of around 12,000 barrels a day scaling up to a larger operation. And that\u2019s on the Atrush Block that we now have a 15% interest in. And in the Sarsang Block, we are preparing for a declaration of commerciality. On that non-operated block we have been producing the initial discovery well there on an interim basis to see how the reservoir performs and look at the commercial elements of marketing those barrels. But those are the two existing discoveries, both non-operated at this point that we are moving towards commercial development of. We are -- with our two operated wells drilling today at Mirawa and Safen, we are hopeful that we will have our first operated discovery on our existing operated acreage and will determine what's success there and what's the best way to proceed to development.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) From Capital One we have Eliot Javanmardi on line. Please go ahead.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One","Just curious if you can provide any color on the Three Forks and the Bakken. Any progress you are seeing there in testing wise. And also if you could talk a little bit about the well cost you are seeing out there.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, the well cost in the Bakken for us are about -- and just to put on the same basis, I did the Eagle Ford there, they are running about $7.9 million, drilling and completion, and an additional $800,000 for facilities and equipment. So about an $8.7 million well cost. And we will continue to do what we can indeed to drive that further down. In terms of the Bakken and the Three Forks, we continue to develop those jointly. I think as we have talked about, we see very substantial potential in the Three Forks that\u2019s been an upgrade to our overall resource assessment for the Bakken. In terms of current drilling activity I don\u2019t have any numbers on that. We\u2019ll look to get back to you Eliot with any detail we can provide on that. But certainly we are continuing to evaluate the additional zones and the additional benches in the Three Forks.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One","Thank you, appreciate that color. And also just as a follow up, just get your macro perspective Clarence on the gas pricing in the U.S for 2013 and 2014 going forward. Just curious your thoughts there.","Clarence Cazalot","Well, our position has been one of I guess a bit bearish. We continue to believe that the governor out there in terms of preventing gas prices from rising too much is simply the degree of switching back to coal and I think as we saw, gas prices get above $4 and begin to rise a bit. We saw coal come back into the mix pretty aggressively. And so once again we see gas prices back down. So we remain rather bearish and rather conservative in our views about natural gas. We don\u2019t really see recovery to $5 or better until 2014 or beyond. And obviously we put our money where our mouth is when you look at where we\u2019re spending our drilling dollars. We continue to focus on liquids in the U.S and North America in general and it\u2019s reflected in as we said before our lower 48 liquids production going from 55% to 72%. So we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019ve got an opportunity set for natural gas, particularly in Oklahoma. We\u2019ve got upside to Henry Hub prices in our EG L&G business. So we\u2019d love to see gas prices go up. But at this point our discretionary investment dollars are going to liquids, particularly crude and condensate.","Operator","From Wells Fargo we have Roger Reed online. Please go ahead.","Roger Reed - Wells Fargo","I apologize. I\u2019m on a cellphone if there\u2019s background noise, but I just wanted to ask quickly, on the Eagle Ford shale, did you discuss at all or can you discuss at all the progress to date on the down spacing, what you\u2019ve seen and any update to this point?","Clarence Cazalot","Roger, we really have said consistently and have said again today, you won\u2019t see the detailed results until the second half of this year in terms of us having enough production history and comparisons to actually then begin to come out. Not just talk about the results, but I think what you really want to hear is what are we going to do about it, how many wells are we going to drill? How much resource do we expect to recover? What does the program look like for the next 10 or 12 years? So that\u2019s information you\u2019ll see later this year. I would say we\u2019ve come out I l believe in the press release and actually said we believe 80 acres is appropriate across the entire core area. So that is what we\u2019ll develop at the very least, including in the areas that we don\u2019t see down spacing potential. But again we\u2019re increasing with drilling on 60 acre spacings now, beginning to move in that direction and continue and assess 40 acres as well. So you\u2019ll see those results and hear the impacts of it later this year.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Ed Westlake back on the line. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","This is more of a bigger picture question. Could you just maybe talk through where you are on potential disposals? Obviously you gave a book loss for some of the Niobrara acreage which was non-core. I don\u2019t know what the cash value of that would be. But I\u2019m more thinking the oil sands, any other assets around the portfolio.","Clarence Cazalot","Let me just say, Ed, I think that the Niobrara we talked about that that will be a second quarter event. So it was not in there and at this point we are not able to talk about the cash side. Once the deal closes we\u2019ll be able to disclose what the cash number is on that sale. In terms of to your point our earlier comment, we are in discussions around a potential sale of a portion of our interest in AOSP. As I\u2019ve indicated there, one way or the other we will tell you what happens there. If we don\u2019t have a deal we\u2019ll let you know and if we do, we\u2019ll let you know that as well. so at this point you can appreciate that discussions are still under way. And they are taking longer perhaps than we would have liked. It is our intent to bring this to a conclusion at quickly as possible. But, again, it takes two to tango on this but we are still in those discussions. Outside of that, I think as we have said, we have closed transactions of $1.3 billion and we are confident of meeting our $1.5 billion to $3 billion target by the end of this year.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Doug Leggate back on the line. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am also taking advantage of this somewhat lately attended call so apologies for the follow up. Two for me, Austin Chalk, Pearsall, can you give us any color as to what proportion of your acreage you believe might be potentially perspective and when can we expect to hear a little bit more in terms of your expectations of drilling plan.","Clarence Cazalot","Yeah, starting with the Austin Chalk, Doug, it's still up in the air as to how much exact acreage we have. We believe it could be as much as 20,000 net acres. But that number is subject to change. To date we have drilled three wells in Austin Chalk, we have one in progress. None of those have been fraced yet, so results yet to come. And in the Pearsall, our view is that we have somewhere around 45,000 net acres in the Pearsall We have drilled five wells to date, four of which were vertical delineation wells that we were able to better understand the reservoir. We drilled one horizontal well and we will be fracking that well next week. So early days I think both on the Pearsall and the Austin Chalk, but certainly we see upside in these reservoirs beyond what we have in the Eagle Ford.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My follow up, I don\u2019t know if Janet is on the line this morning, but my follow up is really on cash flow. The cash flow this quarter looked particularly strong so I am quite keen to see what's happening on the deferred tax line particularly in the U.S. If you could help us just on the moving parts as to why the cash flow was so strong this quarter? I am talking pre-working capital, Janet. Thanks.","Janet Clark","I can tell you this is probably the first quarter where deferred tax a source of cash as opposed to use of cash. I.e. the deferred tax in the U.S. exceeded the negative deferred tax internationally. And of course we expect that to continue to see that grow over time. You know I think, as you know, because we are spending so heavily in the U.S., we are not paying cash taxes here. And our typically our international taxes are primarily cash.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So (inaudible) a $6 billion prospect cash flow number, so any thoughts on use of surplus cash?","Janet Clark","Yeah. I think it's probably the same answer we give you every time we get that question, which is, we look at the priority uses for cash is reinvesting in the business if we have the opportunities and value accretive way to do that. And we can do it in a way that it's cost efficient. Beyond that, we continue to look at our dividend. We think it's a very, very important part of the total shareholder return, and make sure that we have a competitive and growing dividend. We need to strengthen the balance sheet. And when we look at asset sales are chunkier cash inflows, that could potentially cause us to look at stock buyback.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn it back to Howard Thill for final remarks.","Howard Thill","Thank you, Brandon, and thanks everyone for your attention to our conference call.

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning. And welcome to the Marathon Oil Corporation's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; J.R. Sult, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mitch Little, Vice President International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations; Lance Robertson, Vice President North America Production Operations; and Zach Dailey, Director of Investor Relations.","As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release. You can find those remarks and the associated slides at marathonoil.com. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments and answers to questions will contain forward-looking information subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control \u2013 cost, efficiencies, and execution \u2013 and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us positioned for the current environment, as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement.","We find ourselves in a continued low and volatile pricing environment. We've taken decisive action consistent with our business plan released in first quarter: activity in CapEx reductions, capital efficiency and productivity gains, operating and G&A cost reductions and non-core asset divestments.","We have successfully and efficiently achieved our planned activity reductions in the three resource plays to yield a program that will hold production volumes for the balance of 2015 while still progressing our strategic objectives in all three plays. Those objectives are co-development in the Eagle Ford, integration of completion and downspacing pilots in the Bakken, and protecting our valuable leasehold in both our SCOOP and STACK positions while investing in high return outside operated opportunities. Even with these planned reductions, we will still deliver on our growth targets of 5% to 7% for the overall company and 20% for the resource plays year-over-year.","We've also raised the low end of our total company E&P full-year production guidance, essentially increasing the midpoint despite the announced asset sale. Our planned deceleration in capital spend is evident in the sequential reduction in our capital program by almost $500 million and the significant decrease in wells to sales relative to the first quarter. We had already cut exploration spend by half from last year and are continuing to moderate forward commitments as we reset our strategy, including withdrawal from new country entries that do not compete for capital allocation.","For capital efficiency, we've captured greater than $300 million in D&C savings in the U.S. resource plays, or about 20%, and are driving for more. Our completed well costs continue to fall and our well productivity continues to improve. We have reduced unit operating cost in both of our E&P segments from the year ago quarter, more than 30% in North America and 25% in International ex-Libya, and have reflected this in our forward full-year guidance for unit cost, lowering them $1.25 and $1 per BOE respectively.","We were quick to address G&A cost in the first quarter as we finalized our activity plans and implemented a workforce reduction of about 400 people that is expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. Our non-core asset sales are progressing with signed agreements for approximately $100 million toward our target of over $500 million. This recent transaction confirmed that the right assets will generate a competitive process and yield compelling deal metrics even in the current environment.","All of these actions combine to give us confidence and driving toward cash flow neutrality in 2016, inclusive of non-core asset sales. We are only just beginning the budget process for 2016, but we'll focus capital allocation to the high-return U.S. resource plays as several longer cycle investments run their course by the end of this year and exploration spend continues to decline.","Our forward look positions us well below our 2015 $3.3 billion capital program. And while our 2015 quarterly exit rate will be in the range of $700 million to $750 million, we still have the ability to flex down or up as required. Additionally, we expect expense reductions and capital efficiency to continue into 2016. We are optimizing our business around a lower cost structure, holding production levels and protecting our investment in our high-return U.S. resource plays while challenging all other spend in excess of that.","Our U.S. resource plays continue to deliver solid returns at current pricing, with capital efficiency and enhanced productivity lowering breakeven prices. Our last disclosure on our five-year drilling inventory showed 70% of our inventory profitable at $50 a barrel WTI and that analysis did not incorporate our most recent completed well cost savings and productivity enhancements.","We have multiple years of high quality inventory that can deliver competitive returns in the current environment. We do not believe this is a time to be accelerating inventory and associated production from short cycle investments. We believe it's a time for discipline, continuous cost reduction, sustainable efficiency, maximizing returns and balance sheet protection. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $5.5 billion in liquidity at quarter end.","As we move into the second half of 2015, we look forward to providing more results from our co-development in the Eagle Ford, operated downspacing activity in Oklahoma and resource updates for the U.S. unconventional plays.","I want to conclude by taking a moment to recognize our Marathon Oil employees who have been the driving force behind our results in this very dynamic environment. They have stepped forward to lead our efforts in cost reduction and efficiency gains, and have kept their focus on execution despite the distraction of the macro environment. Our employees are committed to an enterprise-first view, for which I'm both thankful and proud.","With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we'd like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications, and you can re-prompt as time permits. With that, Cynthia, we'll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ed Westlake. You may begin.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Good morning. And just wanted to touch base on completions in the Eagle Ford, obviously, the whole industry has been experimenting further with completion technology and seeing some incremental results. Just wanted to get a sense of how you see completions, where you are in terms of testing, and what improvements that you've seen, particularly in the Eagle Ford?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, I would say, for the second quarter and actually the previous couple of quarters, the focus in the Eagle Ford has been to maintain the very high initial production and the high EURs we have. We have some of the highest of each of those in South Texas. Even as we have taken, for example in the second quarter, and taken more than a third of the total wells are outside of the lower Eagle Ford, in either of the Austin Chalk or the Upper Eagle Ford. We've really accelerated that co-development in multiple horizons \u2013 three, and in some cases, four horizons developed across our acreage position, particularly in Karnes County, to see how much vertical density in that total package we could create, as well as the 40-acre and in some cases, 30-acre spacing we have horizontally in that.","So, what we're really most excited about is that, even as we've materially increased the complexity of the co-development through the stack-and-frac pilots, what we've seen is that the production per well in the other horizons, specifically the Upper Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, have competed very favorably with the traditional Lower Eagle Ford. So, we're still getting great results that are competitive, in returns among the best in our portfolio from all three of those horizons, which helps our long-term inventory and really helps our capital efficiency, as we can move to develop more wells per pad across the Eagle Ford.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, yeah, that's clear and very helpful. So, there's an optimization and a science phase and then perhaps, as you go forward and you settle down, you go for more \u2013 once you've proved it, you go for more completion efficiency improvement. Is that a logical thought process?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're always looking for more efficiency, Ed, into that, and we continue to get among the most stages per frac fleet in South Texas out of each of these fleets by very carefully planning our logistics, both on the water and the proppant side, and managing those. I think in the release you saw, we indicated we're going to drill about 20 more wells this year within the same capital in Eagle Ford. We're really just going to use the balance of those wells to manage full frac fleets of activity to drive highest efficiency on the completion side, which is where we have the most cost exposure. So we want to make sure that side is very well supplied with inventory, just so they stay at maximum efficiency.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very clear. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio. You may begin.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In your prepared comments, you talked about $2.8 billion to $3 billion annual CapEx run rate, 2015 exit. I know you mentioned that it's early, but clearly the market is focused on 2016. Philosophically, how do you think about relative outspend into 2016 and kind of balancing the attractive returning assets in the current environment, your financial flexibility and the dividend? Any comments there on an outspend range, or how you're thinking about it approaching 2016?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, maybe Evan, let me maybe talk a little bit about our CapEx views as we exit 2015 and look ahead to 2016, and then perhaps I'll let J.R. maybe talk a little bit on the cash flow outspend question. But you know, as we kind of think about the current prices and look ahead to 2016, we would envision certainly a material lower budget than where we are, below that $3.3 billion and certainly, as you mention, our run rates coming out of this year are certainly south of $3 billion.","We're honestly, though, Evan, right at the beginning of our budget process for 2016, and clearly any actions that we take, our capital allocation is going to be governed in large part by what we see in the commodity price environment. But in general, our strategic approach is going to be to prioritize our available capital to those highest return investments that we have in the North America resource plays. And the balance will go to any previously committed kind of non-discretionary longer cycle requirements. I would also expect, in 2016, that our exploration CapEx is further reduced. It was cut in half this year.","And as you think about, even for a flat to reduced budget into 2016, the North America component of that will still grow in that context, because we have some long cycle investments running their course in 2015. We have further reductions, as I mentioned, in exploration spend, and we also have some non-recurring U.S. infrastructure investments this year in 2015 that are going to provide some accommodation space, if you will, for additional North America investments.","Again, our goal is going to be to target as much investment as we can to the U.S. resource plays, based on the prevailing commodity environment and available cash flows. We still have the inventory to deliver strong and long-term growth, and we're going to protect that optionality as we move into 2016.","With that, maybe I'll just offer it over to J.R., just to talk a little bit about cash flows.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Evan, this is J.R., and I think Lee really kind of, I think, summarized it really well. I mean, it is early in the process but philosophically, from my standpoint, he referred to, the balance sheet strength's going to remain a priority. Again, philosophically, I want to see 2016 be as close to free cash flow neutral, including asset sales, as we possibly can. Many variables to that equation; capital, clearly, capital activity, capital efficiency, capital spend, operating cost efficiency, and of course our success on the ongoing asset sales programs, are all variables in dialing up and down that respective capital profile.","But I think your takeaway should be that we continue to have a great deal of flexibility to manage that and to really achieve all of what we want to achieve, in terms of protecting that balance sheet, in terms of \u2013 if the commodity price environment is supportive of it, to continue to put those North American unconventionals back on a growth track going forward. The one point you did bring up that I'll go ahead and answer, you brought up the question with regard to the dividend.","And as you might imagine, in this environment, it's a question we frequently get. Evan, it's still a very important element to when you think about the total shareholder return for our shareholders, even more so in this environment. And it does, it continues to be that first call on capital in our capital allocation process. The board is very thoughtful and very considered when they address this issue each and every quarter. They are making sure that it's still meeting our long-term capital allocation objectives and they'll continue to fulfil that roll each and every quarter. But honestly, sitting here today, I feel very good. Good solid balance sheet, $5.5 billion of liquidity, $2.5 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents and I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to still continue to deliver that important element to our shareholders.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's it. That's helpful. Let me ask a second question or a segue in kind of an area which I presume would continue to get an increased allocation of capital in Oklahoma. You've added small working interest across a larger number of wells into the second half of the year versus prior spending plans in what appears to be very attractive neighborhood. Could you discuss how far away you think you are from putting Oklahoma, particularly STACK, into full development mode? And could you talk about, I guess, that shift in going to non-op and whether that's planning to leverage a fuller dataset in helping you to and\/or lease or subsequently develop that resource?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Evan, let me maybe start on that one as well. I think we \u2013 we're still in the very early days in the development in Oklahoma in both the STACK and the SCOOP but, as we've said in the past, we certainly believe with well over 1 billion barrels of 2P resource that this is a tremendously important growth engine for the company going forward. Because, again, of capital constraints in the current environment, we're running a two rig operated program there. That's designed to ensure that we protect our very valuable leasehold in both the SCOOP and the STACK.","And as you mentioned, what we're doing is we're participating at a lower interest in the non-operated part of our portfolio to really leverage our funds to continue to grow our data set in Oklahoma in a very cost effective manner. In fact, in total, we've redeployed about $60 million into the Oklahoma non-operated business. And of course, we gain the information and the data from that investment in addition to the barrels, which allows us to continue to move toward that vision of what a full field development will look like ultimately in the SCOOP and the STACK.","But I'd just emphasize that we are early days, but we're making good progress. Already you've seen some movement in our completed well cost downward in Oklahoma, reflecting some good efficiency as well as commercial work by the teams. And I think as we move to scale, we move out of leasehold mode, we get into pad drilling, those efficiencies are simply going to increase over time and we could see even more reduction in the those costs.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Any update on what you added in the quarter lease-wise?","Christopher C. Phillips - Director-Investor Relations","This will be the last question, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sorry. Any update on leasing activity in the quarter in Oklahoma in particular? I'll leave it at that.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No real update there that's material.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate. You may begin.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Lee. Good morning, J.R., and good morning, Chris.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess I'm trying to think of how to word this question so it doesn't count as two. On the dividend, Lee, I understand you've been very clear in the past about your commitment to why you think the dividend is important, but when you talk about cash breakeven, does that include covering the dividend? And I guess what I'm really kind of trying to get at is when you look at who your peer group is nowadays, folks who generally don't have that dividend commitment or obligation, they are able to redeploy \u2013 let's assume now it's $600 million or $570 million in your case towards accelerating something like the STACK or the SCOOP. Why is it better value for shareholders to see that dividend payout in this environment as opposed to moving it towards those high-graded assets? And if you could clarify the breakeven comment, please? And I do have a follow-up. Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Absolutely, Doug. No worries. Just on the cash breakeven that J.R. was addressing in his earlier comments, we view that as inclusive of the dividend. When we think about cash flow neutrality, we're certainly wanting to cover all of our obligations from a capital allocation standpoint and the dividend is an important one of those.","Obviously, with our dividend yield where it sits today, that's a bit different looking than it was in a different commodity price environment, but we still feel that this is an important way to deliver value to our shareholder. And we tend to look at the dividend in the context of our overall capital allocation and in conjunction with the growth that we can generate organically within our very strong North America resource play. So we view those two things as needing to be viewed collectively.","From an investment standpoint, I think in this lower price environment, although you're correct in that it perhaps puts a bit more pressure than some of our peers, I do believe that is a key element of the return that we offer in this type of environment. And as J.R. very well put it, we're sitting with $5.5 billion in liquidity. We do not feel that we need to make any alteration in the way the dividend competes for capital allocation today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the clarification. Just to be clear on the yield comment, do you feel that the yield \u2013 you're not indicating any intent to cut the dividend, are you, with that yield comment?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up is really a similar kind of question this time on exploration, because clearly you're building up your onshore resource backlog which by definition is lower risk. I'm wondering if you could touch on the bigger than expected exploration charge in the current quarter and how you see exploration as a strategy fitting into a lower for longer oil price environment and I'll leave it there? Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me maybe take the high-level question first, Doug, which is more around exploration strategy, how does that fit into our portfolio. As we've shared previously, Doug, we've been assessing our conventional exploration strategy and in really in the context of its ability to compete for capital allocation within the current portfolio which does include, as you well stated, the North America inventory. And it must compete really on a risk adjusted return basis and we really started this assessment some time ago. It really wasn't prompted by the current macro environment. It was really prompted by the depth and quality of the inventory that we saw in the North America resource play.","So we were a bit ahead of the curve. We've already taken the step to reduce exploration essentially by half in 2015. And we certainly see a path that will allow us to moderate that further into 2016. I also mentioned in my opening comments that we most recently withdrew from some new country entries that we just simply felt in the current environment did not compete for capital allocation. So, when you consider the current commodity price environment, when you consider the depth of our resource inventory in North America and the limited capital to invest, it's just simply getting tougher and tougher for conventional exploration to compete for capital on a risk-adjusted basis.","Back to your specific question on kind of the uptick in exploration expense, we did have a write-down in Birchwood, which is our in-situ property in Canada, which contributed to that, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very clear. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate the answers.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd. You may begin.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, gentlemen. If I could and maybe with my first question follow up a little bit on CapEx. You show in your presentation effectively a flatlining of production in the second half of 2015. Is it reasonable \u2013 I know you can't give 2016 outlook, but is it reasonable to think of that level of that $700 million to $750 million CapEx level as kind of a reasonable idea of maintenance CapEx and its ability to hold the production flat for longer?","And you also mentioned the roll off of long cycle spend, expiration reduction potential and non-recurring infrastructure spend. Could you maybe put some numbers around those that we could get maybe a bit of a better pro forma estimate for what the run rate on CapEx looks like into 2016?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, yeah, let me maybe start with addressing what I think is more a question around maintenance capital, and I think first and foremost, Ryan, of course the $700 million, $750 million run rate includes the full portfolio. When we talk about maintenance capital, we tend to focus in on the resource plays themselves in aggregate. And our best estimate of CapEx required to hold those resource plays flat is around $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Of course as capital efficiencies and productivity improvements kick in, there'll be actually downward pressure on that maintenance capital.","And so, when you think about looking ahead and how long could maintenance levels be sustained, my answer to that really would be that we have multiple years of high quality, high return resource play inventory that could ostensibly drive a maintenance level program even in a $50 barrel WTI environment. Again you'll recall, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that when we took a look in our most recent disclosure on our five-year drilling inventory, over 70% of our wells were profitable at $50 barrel for WTI.","So you're right, we have had this rapid deceleration from first quarter to second quarter in our overall capital program, that $500 million that I quoted. We've now kind of settled into, I'd say, a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays. But bear in mind, riding on top of that are some of our other investments that will be a little bit more lumpy and bumpy, including \u2013 we may even see a little bit of an up in third quarter because of some non-recurring infrastructure investments and a few other non-recurring items in our International portfolio. But as you look through that lumpiness in the second half of the year, that $700 million, $750 million exit rate feels about right, with some plus or minus there.","Your other question was around, how much of some of these longer cycle investments may run their course in 2015? And the items there that we talk about when we mention those items are things, like the work that we're doing currently on the EG compression project, which is now heavily in fabrication mode. The work that we did in the EG drilling program, the work that we did also in the UK drilling program. Those are the types of items that we talk about. And so, when we look kind on a net-net basis, as those kind of come off in 2016, there will be some puts and takes, but you're probably in the couple hundred million kind of dollar range, in terms of the accommodation space that that might create within the budget.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. That's very helpful. And maybe, if I could ask a follow-up and if we switch over to maybe the resource in the Bakken, you've got some results out there of 180-day update in high intensity completions, some pilot test results. Can you talk a little bit about maybe your thoughts on the results of the tests, on the pilot test for spacing, and the implications for spacing going forward, and whether the high intensity completion, whether 180 days is long enough to maybe start to impact the type curve, or whether you're still waiting to see an eventual EUR impact?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure, Ryan. I think in general, I'd say we're really, really pleased with the progress, broadly, from the Bakken completion pilots. You step back and look at what we have accomplished over the last several quarters, that material improvement in initial production. Now, with the cumulative production of a group of wells reaching 180 days, you start to see that improvement hold up over time. We've consistently taken those new designs and applications and spread it across our entire portfolio. I would add that, even as we've demonstrated these results that are kind of rearview mirror looking, we're continuing to progress even more intensive stimulations. I think we noted in the notes that, this group you're looking at has 40% more profit and about 10% more completion stages. We continue to see opportunity even beyond that, for more intensity to drive those results further.","I think, based on the results you're seeing and referencing, there's certainly some pressure on us to look at overall EURs and talk about those, perhaps later this year provide some more color and context on that. And obviously, with more EUR combined with the Bakken well cost trending down to plus or minus $6 million, a material reduction there, I think you can see the value implication of the portfolio in Bakken from that. So again, we're very pleased with it, and by all means, we expect that momentum to continue.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And maybe if I could just add, too. On our last update on completed well kind of performance, our single well economics, we had reflected some of the early IP results that we were seeing from the Bakken completion trials, but we as of yet have not introduced the full EUR benefits that potentially we could garner from those wells. So, that's still yet to come.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer. You may begin.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Wanted to follow up on a couple of the items surrounding free cash flow, and then capital allocation priorities. You mentioned earlier the potential for free cash neutrality after asset sales, wanted to just check whether that was before dividend or after dividend? And then, if that dividends is priority number one, just how you're thinking about the secondary priorities of growing production versus letting it decline, allowing leverage to increase or \u2013 and I think I know the answer to this last one \u2013 issuing equity?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, hey, Brian, this is J.R. I mean those are all the variables that we're trying to balance to achieve the optimal outcome of what we're trying to reach. In response to the question, my comments with regard to trying to target as close to free cash flow neutrality as possible is with dividends. I mean, at the end of the day, I think that's vitally important, that we manage the business to where we're not overextending the balance sheet. That balance sheet strength's going to remain important. But as you and I have talked about before, I think, Brian, during this low commodity price environment, I'm definitely leaning on it, and I want to lean on the balance sheet during this period. I just want to make sure I don't stress it too much.","So when I look forward into just an early forward view of 2016, it will be in terms of \u2013 the leaning on that balance sheet will be, I'd say, impacted by the timing of, ultimately, our asset sales programs. There will be periods in which we're leaning on it more than not but that, at the end of the day, I want to try and ensure that, when we get through the year in 2016, that we still have a good solid balance sheet when we get to the end of the year.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And so it would seem like then, from an asset sale perspective, the ideal opportunity would be something that doesn't take a ton away from your cash flow generation but where there's some value. Kurdistan comes to mind as potentially one of those opportunities, and perhaps you could give us an update on how you're thinking about what to do there? And then, if there are other opportunities out there you see in the portfolio, that maybe there's room for a targeted asset sale that wouldn't take away from the cash flow profile?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. I'll take a crack at the asset sale comment, and if you wanted to hear a little bit more about just specifically what's going on in Kurdistan, Mitch can answer that. But we've not been real explicit, Brian, with regard to where in the portfolio. We've highlighted that they would be non-core, they would be assets that just, candidly, are not competing for capital in the portfolio. I think the one transaction we announced this quarter was a non-core natural gas, candidly a high cost asset as well, that was sold for, we think, very compelling economics for $100 million. Just kind of step one in our target of achieving greater than $500 million of asset sales. So I think you should think that we're looking across not only the operating portfolio for non-core assets but also the exploration portfolio as well.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And if there is a Kurdistan, how Kurdistan fits in, I'll take that as part of the follow-up?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President\u2014International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations","Yeah. Brian, this is Mitch Little. I think just in terms of thinking about where Kurdistan fits, we've got three blocks there, as I'm sure you know, at different levels of maturity. The operated block at Harir, we've completed testing of our appraisal well, the well results were largely in line with pre-drill expectations. And so, at this point, we've demobilized the rig. We've substantially completed all of our work commitments there and we're integrating that data into the rest of the technical database and commercial assessment headed towards a commerciality decision on that block later this year.","You're probably also familiar the Atrush Block Phase 1 development is progressing towards a 30,000 barrel a day gross facility, should come online in 2016. And then our interest in the Sarsang Block is progressing towards approval of the field development plan, which will be a phased development ramp-up over time.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Brian, I'm sorry, I should have stepped in or answered that before Mitch. But the reality is, I think we have generated an asset through the work that Mitch and the team have done that has had very solid subsurface success. I think the question we have to continue to ask ourselves is as we think about future investments in Kurdistan, whether or not they compete for capital with the rest of the portfolio.","And if the answer to that is, no, we want to ensure that we can actually capture the value that's been generated by the team in order to redeploy that capital someplace else. So, as I said, I'm trying not to be explicit with regard to what particular asset so I don't put myself in a competitive disadvantage in a process, but you should expect that we're looking across the entire portfolio for candidates.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Heikkinen. You may begin.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Every call.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're a good sport, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I am. I need to figure out a way to respell my name or something so they pronounce it correctly. As I think about the profitable at $50 oil, are you using a well level economic or is that asset level inclusive of all costs or how do you define that inventory and metrics for profitable at $50 oil?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We tend to look at single well economics from an external standpoint, which allows us to benchmark, I think, more effectively with what others put out into the public domain, David. I think internally, though, we also want to look and see from a fully burdened level what is the return not only down to the well level, but at a program or even a rig line in a particularly area in a particularly play. We want to make sure that we fully understand the fully burdened economics of those wells. So, there is an aspect of it, which is we want to be able to make sure that we can compare externally, but certainly internally we want to make absolutely sure we understand the total return from those investments.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Just to be clear, what Lee's point is is that when you look at our completed well costs, that truly is just completed well costs. But when you look at the returns that we share, those have been burdened by facilities at least individual well facilities necessary for flow, not to the extent of broad central facilities but individual well facilities.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. So it has all the surface, everything needed?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Correct. Artificial lift, et cetera.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Basically the lifecycle cost of the well ex any main centralized facilities, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Is there any particular area where the other 30% falls? I mean is it Williston, STACK, Eagle Ford in that order? That's probably I would do, but...","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The last disclosure that we offered up when we kind of showed the relative economics of various plays from a single well economics standpoint, it was clear that Eagle Ford and Oklahoma were at the most competitive portion of that plot. The higher quality in the Bakken was also in that same zip code and that really is what drove our capital allocation as we came into to 2015.","I think what you've heard is that the Eagle Ford as well as Oklahoma have continued to also improve from a single well economic standpoint, from a cost and productivity standpoint, but also the Bakken has continued to improve its competitiveness as well. And we'll hopefully be able to share a little bit more color on that a bit later in the year, as we're able to roll in some of the specific updates on EURs and single well economics. But I think that that order in terms of capital allocation is exactly what you see in our current portfolio, which is the Eagle Ford wells, particularly condensate and high-GOR oil to certain extent are still very strong from a return standpoint. Both the SCOOP and the STACK still compete very favorably as well. And then in the higher quality areas of Bakken such as the Myrmidon, they're also competing for capital allocation.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then asset sales around $500 million next year, as well is a reasonable assumption?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","David, I just think what you ought to assume is what we've talked about is greater than $500 million, haven't been really explicit on timing. I thought give it 12 months from when we announced it again, but we wouldn't have put a target out there if we didn't have some degree of confidence. But you should expect that program to continue and not necessarily stop if we cross the $500 million level.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. Okay. Thanks.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Herrlin. You may begin.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Some quick ones. When you look at your portfolio, Lee, I want to get back to the short cycle, long cycle type activity. What do you think's kind of an ideal balance and if you have more of an emphasis on short cycle, is it time to revisit hedging?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me, I'll may be let J.R. jump in on the hedging question. But let me first talk about long cycle versus short cycle. Right now, the bulk of our investment dollars are flowing into North America short cycles and the driver there is they have the highest risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio that we have today. So, for us, it's probably a little bit less about short cycle, long cycle than it is about where can we generate the highest risk-adjusted return.","And to the extent that we continue to see long cycle or longer cycle opportunities and great examples are the things that we've done in Equatorial Guinea and the UK this year in terms of the program drilling that we've done there that are very strong from a capital allocation standpoint and have added very profitable barrels to the portfolio.","So, in no way are we necessarily turning our back on longer cycle type investments, but the balance is going to be dictated by the opportunity set we have in the portfolio and being driven by generating those highest risk-adjusted returns. From a hedging standpoint, certainly we view that as just an element of overall commodity risk management, and maybe I'll let J.R. comment on that.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, John. You and I have talked before. It's definitely a tool that we need to be using, we are using. We've been far more active than, I think Marathon has been in the past. Would I like to have more hedges on today, yes, but we have probably at least for the balance of 2015 and I know the market is more concerned about 2016, we've probably got about 35,000 barrels a day hedged for the balance of 2015 and we really just were able to begin to establish a position in 2016 before the market kind of fell on us. But it is definitely going to be a tool we're going to continue to use.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, J.R. One other one for me. In the Eagle Ford, you had incredible drilling efficiency. Are you changing crews, are you getting different rigs, how can you have this level of improvement in your well design or execution?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","John, I think what you're seeing is just a recognition by a team who refuses to accept that they've done their best work already. They continue to see in the future, they can be innovative and thoughtful. In this case, part of the change is that as we've moderated activity, we've certainly kept the best rigs and the best crews, because it helps both our operational efficiency as well as our environmental safety performance. We've retained rigs with the highest specifications, so the right types of capabilities that we moved to in that rig fleet that can really drive it. And those unique attributes of those rigs allow us to use other types of downhole tools.","The combination of those technologies together has really delivered this performance. And I would say while 1,800 feet per day was materially better than the year ago quarter, our best rigs are at 2,600 feet, 2,700 feet per day already, which shows you the gap, right. If we can get the whole fleet to there, there's still room to improve that overall. We see that as sustainable. And in fact, as we've moved to the stack-and-frac pilots and the co-development of multiple horizons, we actually think that enables that type of efficiency further, because when we're going to drill more wells on each pad as we go to development.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, John, too, it's probably important to note that when we look at the true pace at our drilling performance in the Eagle Ford, where we had one of our best rigs deliver 3,100 feet per day. It just gives you a feel for just how much more room we have to drive toward if we're averaging 1,800 feet for the quarter. So it does show that there is continuing efficiency gains that can be made. Now will we get that immediately across the whole fleet? No, but it does set that marker out there of what can be achieved with the best crews, the best equipment being brought to bear.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Hanold. You may begin.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. If I could step back and again kind of focus on big picture, where Marathon's going at this point in time, be somewhat agnostic to current low commodity prices, with the resource potential that you all are building in some of the North American resource plays, is there a transformation occurring where Marathon is going to become more focused on these lower risk, potentially higher returning short cycle opportunities? And again, being somewhat agnostic to low prices right now?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Absolutely, Scott, I mean that transformation is underway \u2013 has been underway. I think as we have made this very decided pivot to North America resource plays for clear economic reasons, you're seeing that in where our investment dollars are flowing. And you're right, we have this incredible 3 billion barrels of 2P resource inventory in the three core U.S. resource plays that affords us a tremendous amount of future opportunity.","And our challenge is ensuring that we get the appropriate investment levels driven to those three core plays and bring those up to scale development. I mean, we're really at scale in the Eagle Ford. Certainly, we've been in Bakken at scale for some time as well, but Oklahoma is still an area where we would like to see more capital invested and not just the non-operated but also the operated program. And certainly as we think about that incremental amount of capital coming available to invest, we absolutely see that flowing to places like the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, good. Thanks. And as a follow-up and I know both of you all have been in this industry for quite some time and, J.R., you're obviously experienced from some of your past firms, with the low price environment we are in right now, can you discuss from an industry consolidation perspective, your view on what could occur, and how Marathon fits into that?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, it's always tough to speculate, I think, on the M&A space. I think right now, with the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace, it's very challenging, I think, to see a lot of deal activity. And in fact, that's really what's played out. There's been a few one-off opportunities that were probably taken, the decisions may have been taken in a slightly different environment than we find ourselves today. But with equities very depressed, I think with everyone kind of reacting to another dramatic downtick in pricing, it's hard to imagine there's going to be a lot of that type of activity, at least in the near-term.","Now, as you look further ahead, and we see a more persistent kind of lower for longer price environment, then I think the concept that there will be additional consolidation, additional opportunities come available to those that are prepared to take advantage of those, then absolutely I would agree with that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Guy Baber. You may begin.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Guy.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Guy.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You fared a little bit better than David did on the last name.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","That's right. I have been called Gee numerous times, so Guy is better, I'll take it. I was hoping to clarify a few comments you just made earlier in the Q&A, Lee, but you mentioned that in this price environment, capital spending would be down from the current year. You also said that even with a flat to lower budget in 2016, that the North American production component would grow. So could you just elaborate on that comment a bit? Want to make sure that we have that right. And really just trying to understand that assertion, and square that with our understanding that the unconventional production would exit this year below the full-year average, and then on maintenance CapEx levels, you could hold that 4Q exit rate flat through 2016. So just want to make sure we understand that trajectory and some of the moving parts that we might be missing?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No. Absolutely. I tried to address, again honestly, we're not \u2013 we're very early in the planning cycle for 2016, but just thinking about it conceptually, we know that our capital budget will be less than where we stand in 2015. In fact, the run rate that you mentioned as we exit 2015, that $2.9-ish billion (51:00) kind of run rate, certainly less than the $3 billion, that really does entail an ability to direct more capital deployment to the North America resource plays. So, for a bit smaller pie, we're able to today dedicate a much larger slice to the North America resource plays, even in that scenario. And so, the ability to have that optionality to move from more of a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays to more of a growth mode, we still have that optionality within a reduced budget in 2016.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Did that get it clarified, Guy?","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Yeah. That helps a ton. Thanks. That was the only one that I had.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you, Guy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth. You may begin.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Phillip.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","On the Eagle Ford, you noted the 40% sequential decline in activity as the reason for lower production. Looking at the expected wells to sales in the second half, it looks like the quarterly average is going to be a little bit lower than what you had in 2Q. So is the current activity run rate below maintenance CapEx for this asset, or can volumes still be held flat on better well productivity in the second half or a shallower decline, given that you probably had a lot of flush production coming into the year?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Yeah, Phillip, I think you're seeing that actually very well. Compared to the previous several quarters, where we've had in excess of 90 wells to sales, in the second quarter, we had 52 wells per sales, which is driving that production in Eagle Ford downward. Really, the wave of those higher productivity wells that are very early in their life coming down has kind of overwhelmed the number of new wells to sales. I think from a perspective of activity across North America, including Eagle Ford, has come down about 45% for us, what you really see is, we're managing that downward to a point of stability.","We will have roughly the same number of wells, plus or minus, in the third quarter and fourth quarter in Eagle Ford specifically. In any given quarter, our working interest moves around a little bit within that, so the number of gross wells and net wells can move a bit. So I think in general, we are guiding toward relatively flat production quarter-over-quarter, and we're managing that large activity downward in the quarter.","I would say, too, some context on that is, even as we said the wells to sales were lower in Eagle Ford, I think it's important to note we went from five frac fleets to two frac fleets by April. So we were down to that lowest level of wells to sales driven activity by very early in the second quarter, which kind of added to that deceleration impact.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then, can you discuss any results from the one Osage well brought on during the quarter? I think Marathon might be the first to drill a well in this zone. Based on what you know to date, how would you also compare this emerging play to both the Meramec and the Woodford?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure Phillip, last year we started an exploration program in STACK focused on Meramec and the Osage. That Osage well was the last well of the initial group, our initial foray into the STACK in an operated basis, I think you may recall in the second half of last year, we actually increased activity in Oklahoma up to six rigs and that well was drilled, effectively starting right after Christmas and is sort of the last well in that program. We've evaluated the results from all of those. We continue to see the Meramec is the most valuable zone in that area in general. I don't think we foresee more Osage activity anytime in the near term.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov. You may begin.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. You're talking about selling some assets in an extremely depressed environment where there are plenty of distressed sellers that are in far worse shape than you are. Isn't it kind of leaving money on the table if you're monetizing just about anything right now?","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first of all, I don't view our non-core assets as being distressed sales. And the reason I say that, Pavel, is that when you think about the type of assets that we will put in the market, we believe that there's still a very strong competitive environment for those assets and I'll use the East Texas, North Louisiana Wilburton transaction as an example. We had a very strong response to the data room. We had well over 20 proposals for the property.","When you look at the deal metrics, they were very compelling on cash flow multiple basis, over 9X. And so, we feel like for the right type of asset, there is still a ready market out there and I would not want to leave the impression that we're selling anything at reduced value or low value to our shareholders. I mean we don't view these as distressed assets, we simply view them as part of our ongoing portfolio management. And if we can't capture fair value, then we'll continue to operate.","In the case of the East Texas, North Louisiana Wilburton deal, it was a gassy asset, it was no longer competing for capital allocation, relatively high unit cash cost. We had a strong competitive environment for it and the deal metrics were very competitive in this pricing environment or others. So I think we feel very good about our ability to continue to transact at fair values.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Just to clarify, it's not your assets I was calling distressed, it's plenty of others (57:08) in the market that are in that state. Now my follow-up is, you talk about flexing the balance sheet into 2016, debt-to-cap is currently at 29%. How high would you be comfortable letting that metric go up?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. What I would tell you is I've always tried to be careful to draw hard and fast rules. But when I think of looking through 2016, when I take into consideration what I said before about the variables around capital, operating cost structure, asset sales programs, I still want to ultimately manage the balance sheet through 2016 to, let's call it, as close to 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA as I can in this low commodity price environment.","Now that's going to be lumpy. It's going to be dependent upon the timing of various asset sales and so that will become a bit higher than that. But that's ultimately one of the variables I'm trying to manage to. And as commodity prices then begin to stabilize, whether that's early 2017 or you decide when, then ultimately you'll see that leverage get back to its more traditional levels of two times and below.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Useful. Appreciate it, guys.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Pavel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell. You may begin.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Wow, I didn't think you could mispronounce Campbell, but that's okay.","Lee M. Tillman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","My first question regards the Oklahoma resource plays, the increased non-op participation. I was just wondering, are the choices driven by any specific operator performance or is it driven more by geography?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Jeffrey, I think overall, we're focused on value. We have a substantial core acreage position in both the SCOOP and in the STACK. When we see activity in that core high-value acreage, where we've seen great historical results and from recent data we expect those results to be great in other areas. We're choosing to participate in those wells to capture the data and leverage both the collection of that data and integration of it to drive toward full field development. And to some extent, if you didn't participate in those valuable acres, it's an opportunity lost. We certainly want to capture all those opportunities. So it's not really driven by an operator, it's driven by our perceived value of the acreage and the opportunity.","I'd say within the context of that, we see more \u2013 I'd say, more execution friendly operators than others. And as you'd imagine, based on that, we make economic decisions based on how we feel they can execute.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And my other question was on slide 17 regarding the Bakken spacing pilots to this point. The ranges appear less prolific on some of the non-spacing data that's provided, yet a large production uplift was identified out to 180 days. So I'm wondering if you can help me to understand how to interpret the data that's being presented? And as well, if you could indicate how you feel the pilots are performing relative to your expectations at this point?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure. So with three spacing pilots online, I feel like we've made a lot of progress at moving that forward on an operated basis. I'll kind of start and work south to north, if you will. Spacing pilots are in three different areas, starting in the south, it's Middle Bakken, so it's on a six well per Middle Bakken pattern overall. There is a wide range of results here. I think in the case of that pilot in the Ajax area, when you look at the aggregate, or all of the wells on there, you'll see some above type curve, you'll see some a little below but when you put them together, they look like they're performing very in line with our early expectations for that, despite being at closer spacing than stand-alone wells. So that gives us a lot of encouragement. We expected some differentiation.","In some cases, what we'll find is, when we go in and there's more than one parent well or older well in the area, you will see some depletion impact, and the new well that's near that older well will be impacted modestly by that. But in aggregate, we tend to look at the entire unit, how many wells, how many total dollars invested, what's the total production coming out of that. And so, that Ajax pilot, for example, is performing very much in line with those expectations.","Moving further north to Hector and that pilot, again we see a diversity of results, but in aggregate they're performing very similarly to our expectations for the early production. Some of the wells in those groups are more mature than others. So, several of those are at 90 days or 120 days, and they're continuing to perform well. So, we're very pleased with that result overall.","In these pilots, some of the wells vintage-wise had more aggressive stimulations than others based on when they were drilled and completed. And then lastly in Myrmidon, we see a wide range there too. I think in the case of that one pilot, we intentionally looked at that pilot and said there are four older parent wells between those two sections or units that were developed together. And so the wells near those \u2013 the new wells near the parent wells are showing a lesser production than the wells that are further outlying. And that's not unexpected. In our case, we want to test that as we have parent wellbores we need to work around. But I think, in general, we're still very pleased with the overall production and continue to see that as a validation of our spacing assumptions moving forward.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That's fantastic color. If I could just add a little follow-up, because the question was long enough to begin with. Just to clarify, do these spacing pilots have any cost advantages over a more typical production pad, or is this just purely about trying to capture the maximum resource?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Jeffrey, any time we have the opportunity to pad develop groups of wells, we have a great opportunity on the drilling efficiency side to capture those cost savings. Similarly on the completion side, we can leave a frac fleet on one pad and complete multiple wells, on both of those fronts, we gain tremendous efficiency. And then lastly, on the surface facility, the ability to share those surface facilities also creates a scale efficiency. So, we constantly seek and desire the opportunity for pad development because it really does positively influence our capital.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay.

Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach, and good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments then open the call for questions.","2016 was a year about delivering on our commitments, and delivering on these commitments despite an extremely volatile commodity price environment that saw oil trade below $30 a barrel. We set a clear overarching goal for 2016, to live within our means by balancing CapEx and the dividend with operating cash flow and proceeds from our non-core asset program. Not only did we achieve this outcome, but we did so inclusive of our material STACK acquisition in Oklahoma.","Our success was predicated on capital discipline, portfolio management, operational execution and a relentless focus on our costs. We ultimately finished the year at $1.1 billion of CapEx, down $300 million from our original budget, while exceeding the mid-point of our production guidance. And within that reduced capital spend we exited the year running 12 rigs in the U.S. resource plays, gaining valuable operational momentum as we look to average 22 rigs in 2017. We executed on all of these fronts in 2016, while ending the year with $2.5 billion in cash and $5.8 billion of total liquidity, positioning the company strongly for 2017 and beyond.","Last night, we announced a 2017 capital program of $2.2 billion of $2.2 billion, with over 90% allocated to our high return U.S. resource plays, and roughly balanced with about a third to Oklahoma, Bakken and the Eagle Ford.","Our top capital allocation priorities remain STACK leasehold, delineation and down spacing in Oklahoma, as we prepare that asset for full-field development in early 2018. We'll more than double our Oklahoma rig count from six 6 today to about 13 by the end of the year to achieve that.","Beyond Oklahoma strategic objectives, we'll be ramping Bakken activity significantly, with two-thirds of their capital dedicated to bringing our high-return Myrmidon area to development mode this year. We'll build upon last year's success from high intensity completions that generated basin-leading well results from both, our West Myrmidon and East Myrmidon acreage and take advantage of scale efficiencies.","We plan to extend the application of higher intensity completion techniques to Hector, where we have a larger footprint of about 115,000 net acres. Even with modest uplift, the Hector program is expected to meet or exceed East Myrmidon returns.","And, finally, the Eagle Ford will become a substantial free cash flow generator as we keep activity at maintenance levels in 2017, while protecting our economies of scales and enhancing efficiencies even further. Rates of return in Eagle Ford are very compelling, as we continue to focus on the high margin oil window and benefit from very low completed well costs. This capital program accelerates quarterly growth in resource plays to the second quarter and achieves exit-to-exit oil and boe growth of 15% to 20% in the resource plays, while [audio skip] (05:25) cash flow this year at $55 WTI.","2017's momentum positions us strongly for the future and places us on track for 2017 to 2021, oil and boe production years, of 10% to 12% for the total company. That includes Oil Sands, but excludes Libya, and increased U.S. resource play CAGR guidance of 18% to 22%, also, for oil and boe.","We plan to achieve all of these growth rates within cash flows each year, inclusive of the dividend at flat $55 WTI. We believe that a business model built around sustainable, profitable growth within cash flows will deliver excellent long-term results for our shareholders.","With that we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-answer session. . And our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, you guys raised your long-term U.S. resource growth guidance from 15% to 20% to 18% to 22% \u2013 or to 18% to 22% from 15% to 20%, within cash flow. Can you walk us through the pieces that drove the raise? And given the size of the rig \u2013 ramp what you're expecting on the inflation side?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, Evan, let me kind of address. You know, first of all the 15% to 20% was really calibrated on a very preliminary view of our plan, Evan, so a lot of it was just fully building on our plan, getting the latest and greatest definition built into that plan. And with that work, we've been able to move that number forward, so we feel very confident in that. I'll maybe offer a few high level views on the second part of your question on the inflation piece. And, then maybe let Mitch chime in with some specifics.","You know, obviously, we have built an inflation in our capital program, and we built that in with, you know, due consideration of being able to be successful at mitigating elements of that through continued secular efficiencies, but there are lot of moving pieces to it. I mean, we are increasing the intensity of designs, we know that inflation will vary both, by basin as well as by service line. So, there are many, many elements of it. And, of course, we're somewhat reluctant to talk about hard numbers, because quite frankly, we're still out there negotiating with a lot of our service providers. And, we don't see a lot of benefit in that. But, it is built in. It does match up with our view of pricing and activity. And, I think, we've also done some things on the commercial side that will continue to not only give us some advantages, but also continue to provide us flexibility in the event that we can need to modulate activity.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, Evan. Good morning. This is Mitch. Just building on a couple of Lee's comments, you know, heading into the year, we built in some protections, locking in rates at or near the bottom on a number of drilling rigs. Certainly, see a bit more pressure on the completion side of things, and less so on the drilling rigs side. I'd also offer, as we move in to scale in the Bakken and also ramping up activity at Oklahoma, we'd expect to be able to capture efficiencies like we've seen in the Eagle Ford. So, there's certainly an offset there. And, obviously, with the additional scale and activity, we'll continue to leverage that to make sure that we maintain competitive pricing across all three basins.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. And maybe for a second question. Just want to better understand what drove the equal capital allocation among the three unconventional plays, you know, specifically the increase in the Bakken as a percentage of spending over the Eagle Ford IGOR (10:09) region. And, you know, were the limitations on the pace of development in each basin? I know you're ruining 22 rigs, average up from 14 rigs, or was it \u2013 was allocation strictly returns-driven? Any color there would be helpful.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, first and foremost, you know, Evan, as I stated in my opening comments, and I think as we've talked about is, we were going to make sure we achieved our strategic objectives in Oklahoma, and that's around protecting our valuable leasehold, delineation and doing the downspacing and completion work that we need to have at hand to drive that asset toward full-field development in 2018. We feel that the program we've designed this year allows us to deliver across all of those strategic objectives.","Once we met that, really, the criteria was to look at where we could generate the highest risk adjusted returns as well as continue to capture a scale efficiencies, and that really led us down the path of the capital allocation that you see in the plan.","The Bakken opportunities compete head-to-head with the best in our portfolio, we challenged the Bakken team to really step up last year. They did so, really demonstrated their ability to go head-to-head with even the oil window in the Eagle Ford. And based on that, we struck a balance between those two assets. With Eagle Ford already operating at scale and very efficiently, we wanted to drive Bakken into more of a development mode, while also seeking to extend the success we saw in Myrmidon to places like Hector, so that was really the high level allocation.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Evan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Kalei S. Akamine - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys. Good morning. This is Kalei on for Doug.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hi, Kalei. Good morning.","Kalei S. Akamine - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, a couple questions from me. So, understand that you guys have a handful of operative pilots planned in the STACK this year. And I'm wondering whether those will be primarily in the Central to Eastern Kingfisher region where you guys have a lot of contagious acreage. And what I'm really trying to understand is how important those results will be in terms of updating your STACK oil type curve that continues to look too low.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Kalei. This is Mitch. I'll address your question. And then, Lee can add to it if he likes. But, we're going to be bringing four to five STACK infill pilots to sales during 2017, likely spud a couple more than that.","First one is the Yost infill that we TDed in fourth quarter That's a six-well infill, testing a couple benches and six wells per section there in Kingfisher, and our next infill will also be in that same area. Throughout the year, we'll be testing tighter well density, different landing zones. We see up to \u2013 between four and six high quality potential landing intervals. We'll certainly be optimizing around that, optimizing completion designs, flow back techniques and different stack-and-stagger concepts.","As you said, our core wells continue to perform at or above the type curve expectations, including the Schoeder (14:03) well right in Northern Canadian there that we released this quarter. And, certainly all that's going to be integrated into understanding the longer term performance and the best way to optimize full-field development into 2018. So, we'll integrate that and update as appropriate.","Kalei S. Akamine - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate your comments. In the Bakken, it looks like you guys are moving forward with those enhanced completions, which provided strong results, but the range of propane on the go-forward plan look quite wide. You look to be at about 5 million pound to 16 million pound. I'm wondering, what's the reason behind the variation in that completion design? And, can you talk about whether these improvements can support an expansion in the Bakken inventory?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. I'll address that one as well. And, the variability in propane, total propant per well is really specific to different intervals that we are developing in the Bakken, whether Middle Bakken or Three Forks, first and second benches. Typically a little bit lower sand density propant concentration in the Three Forks, so that would represent the lower-end and the higher end as more typical of our Middle Bakken completions, different fluid types.","You know, and as we talked about, we're moving to development mode in Myrmidon, where we've got that 60,000-acre position in advanced or advantaged geology. Looking to extend that into Hector, where we've got about twice the acreage position and we're applying the same science that we used last year to apply in the Myrmidon area and deliver those basin-leading results. So we got pretty \u2013 I've got pretty high confidence in our ability to uplift those wells. And, as Lee noted in his opening comments, just a modest uplift will move that program up to be very competitive in our portfolio.","Kalei S. Akamine - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Appreciate the comments.","Operator","And, our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. You may begin.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. If I could start with a high-level question, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","You've got to that sort of 20% range of growth. Would you consider that to be a terminal level, whereby we could consider any future cash flow upside to be, I guess, perhaps even rotated into buyback or how do you see the position of Marathon in terms of what the marginal discipline will be from this point, given that you, as I say, once you get to that sort of 20% CAGR, you're kind of hitting a terminal level of growth I would have thought. Thanks (16:46).","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think, Paul, you know, I still believe that in our model for the five-year plan, bear in mind, that's a benchmark kind of flat $55 WTI. And so, we were optimizing again around living within cash flows to deliver those long-term CAGRs. We still have the organic inventory, if you will, to put additional capital to work if we were to see more constructive pricing. And, that would obviously be our preference from a shareholder value standpoint would be to continue to look at that.","At some point, of course, you're going to hit a pace of activity that probably would not be supported, and you would have to look at other opportunities for use of that incremental capital. I think, we've been very explicit that, for instance this year, we have cash on hand on our balance sheet. And we're going to be looking to use that to provide flexibility on handling some of our near-term debt maturities. Directionally, you know, we'd like to bring down our gross debt and we also want to be able to participate broadly \u2013 and resource capture opportunities in the market, particularly large accretive bolt-on, not dissimilar to what we did last summer with the STACK acquisition, so all of those things from my perspective offer incremental value to the shareholder if we meet all of our organic needs.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, what would be the returns basis? For example, the choice to expand rather than to buy in your own stock or once you've done the debt repay down, which I understand?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think, then it just becomes an economic view. But, I think, given the incremental returns that we're able to generate, particularly in the short cycle U.S. investments, Paul, I feel very confident that those will compete very favorably to alternative uses of giving the cash back to the shareholder.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then if I could ask a very specific follow-up.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","The wells bought to sales in Bakken and Oklahoma, seem a little bit light to us, relative to the way you're ramping up the rig count? Is that \u2013 because we would be expecting a sort of backlog or sort of these situations to be building up into 2018? And if so, could you just quantify that what that is? Thank you.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Paul. As we ramp up to the higher activity levels, we'll certainly be building some operational inventory towards the end of the year. And keep in mind as well, in the Bakken, we're planning to do up to 25 refracs. Those are not included in new wells to sales. They would be incremental to that, but you can imagine it as being kind of a handful of pads in the Bakken. And, you know, similar number well count in Oklahoma that we would build just an operational inventory to make sure we operate on the completion side as efficiently as is possible, keeping full utilization of steady crews.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","First question is a bit of a follow-up to Paul's last question there. If we look at the Eagle Ford, I think, you mentioned that the six rigs puts it into a maintenance mode or maintenance capital. Does that mean we should expect a generally flat exit-to-exit or should we expect that that would get us or get Marathon some production growth? And similar type question for six rigs on the Bakken?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, first, you know, let me deal with Eagle Ford. You know, though we've talked about maintenance activity levels. And, again, we don't do \u2013 usually, we don't provide exit-to-exit course on a basin-by-basin basis. But, what I will say, you know, Brian is that the Eagle Ford will participate in that five-year CAGR growth. As we optimized the 2017 program, the Eagle Ford, at a maintenance level, made sense. We have sufficient inventory though to continue to drive growth in the Eagle Ford in the future. And certainly within that time year window and the Eagle Ford is a component of that longer-term CAGR that we've talked about the 18% to 22%.","On the Bakken, we are looking at an initial ramp-up this year as we get it back into development mode. And then, I think with respect to the future, we anticipate that Bakken will continue to grow and again participate in those long-term growth rates, but it's probably a little early to start talking about how we might or might not optimize the 2018 plan, specifically, but we expect all three basins to participate in that long-term CAGR.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then, my follow-up is just a strategic one with the focus very narrowed here on these three key resource plays. Did you feel like you have sufficient scale, obviously, you're due to get to the CAGR that you've mentioned here, but did you see opportunities out there either to expand your positions or swap positions to further add scale within these three areas or are there any other resource areas you're focused on.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, we're very happy with our organic inventory and feel confident in our ability across our three basins to deliver on the CAGRs that that we've talked about. Having said that, Brian, we're always looking at potential resource capture opportunities within our three core basins. I think, that was clearly on display last year with the STACK acquisition. We've done some smaller bolt-ons as well. One of the reasons we want financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet is, so that we can participate in those market opportunities, as they present themselves. But, in terms of the delivery of the plan that we have described from a CAGR standpoint, we have the organic opportunities to power that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. You may begin.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, guys. So the International component of your production's still almost half of the total, but it's getting only 10% of the CapEx. How long do you think you can maintain those International volumes, including oil sands at their current CapEx run rate?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, the International business is still a material element of our business. But, obviously, it is also shifted in its significance, not only from a capital allocation standpoint but also from an overall volumetric standpoint as well. The North America segment now is quite a bit larger than our International segment. And that, of course, is by design; that's where our growth assets are.","But, from a cash flow contribution standpoint, obviously, the International segment via our integrated business in Equatorial Guinea remains still a large component of free cash flow generation for the corporation that can be redeployed. That's even amplified in 2017, as we have come out of a relatively high investment year in Equatorial Guinea with the installation and startup of the compression deck last year. Similarly, OSM with improved performance, both on the reliability side, as well as on the cost side, offers the ability to provide free cash flow as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Scott. Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Maybe another question on capital allocation. And, just as you look into 2018 and through that 2021 outlook, how do you envision \u2013 you know, obviously, you're not looking for too much specifics, but how do you envision the weighting of that allocation going between the three resource plays, right now it's a third, a third, a third. But, as you look forward over the next few years, where ultimately do you want that to get to by 2020?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Again, we haven't provided a specific projection around that, Scott. But, where we sit today, I would say we have never had a more diverse set of high return opportunities that are competing. I mean, if you looked at some of our material, where we've given some of those opportunities and the associated indicative economics, we've got a broad suite of things to select from and many opportunities that really didn't even show up on that page, things like the Springer and Oklahoma for instance and condensate in the Eagle Ford.","So, our view is that we're going to continue to look first at delivering on strategic objectives in our plays. To the extent that we meet those, then we're going to look at it from a risk-adjusted return basis and also trying to leverage our ability to generate scale efficiencies. And so, it will be an ongoing real-time optimization of capital. That's part of the short-cycle business and you should expect to see that that one-third, one-third, one-third is not something that's set in stone. That will move as we move the business over the next five years.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right, so is there particular bias? So, I mean, it seems like the STACK that, you know, certainly has got the most, I guess, relative...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yes.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...upside excitement. Would that be, you know, just \u2013 would there be a bias of getting a little bit more active there?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, certainly, as you point out, Scott, it is the basin that is earliest in its maturity cycle and has quite a bit of running room in front of it. So, I would agree that on balance, Oklahoma will be a large consumer of capital allocation going forward in that five-year period.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, Libya, I understand the unknowns and uncertainties in terms of what's going to happen there. But, you did get a little bit of production this quarter \u2013 this past quarter. You know, where do we stand today and what could be the potential, I guess, from our seat upside implications if you do get some volumes coming through the year? How much incremental cash flow could you all stand to benefit there?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Scott, this is Mitch. Production resumed in fourth quarter. And, as we exited the year, gross production was up to about \u2013 just under 80,000 barrels a day, so little under 11,000 net. It's held pretty steady at that level this far into the year. Certainly, the Libyans would like to ramp that up. There're some infrastructure issues that need to be addressed, both at the export terminal, some of the transportation lines and some of the inner field lines that will dictate that pace along with just kind of the ebb and flow on the ground there with a political situation. So, pretty hard to project where that's headed. But today, sitting around 80,000, which is where we finished the year or 11,000 net.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","(29:26).","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","I think the fact \u2013 I'm sorry, Scott. I was just going to say, I think the fact that we were successful like getting a couple of liftings in the fourth quarter, that's a \u2013 you know, that's a great signal to us that at least we've been able to generate some cash flow there. I know some of our partners have addressed that as well. But we view Libya, as a potential contributor of free cash flow assuming that the security situation remains stable this year. We clawed back some of our under-lifted positions, but we would think that we would see some free cash flow generation there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Would you be willing to sort of quantify based on where we're at today, how big that could be?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I mean, it's going to be probably in the $100 million to a couple hundred million bucks in that neighborhood. But, again, it's going to be dependent upon, how we go.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Absolutely. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Scott, and I'd just add a couple of comments there. Of course, it's not in our guidance. And our projections of living within our means are excluding Libya. But our interest is the same as the other large international ownership of those \u2013 partner in those concessions, but as Lee mentioned, we had two liftings in December. So we're in a slightly different position.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. You may begin.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much. Obviously, activity levels picking up pretty quickly in Oklahoma, I was hoping you could just address any risks to the activity ramping at such a fast rate? And I'm thinking in terms of having the human resource capabilities in place, having full understanding of the subsurface given the PayRock's relatively recent addition to the portfolio and even things like infrastructure constraints?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Jason. This is Mitch. As we were building our activity plan and execution plan across all three resource plays late last year, we put a well-defined execution strategy together, which of course address staffing, infrastructure, access to services and all of that. And so, we're tracking that regularly and we're on or ahead of plan across all of those major objectives. We're not having difficulty in sourcing either human resources or the suppliers that we need to execute that plan. And so, we don't really see that being a bottleneck for us.","On the infrastructure side, we're actively working various aspects of that both, on the crude oil and on the residue gas side. We do see a need in the longer-term \u2013 mid-term to longer-term to add additional infrastructure for residue gas takeaway capacity. And, we also \u2013 while we don't have any limitations, we would like to see more of our oil on pipe and are moving in that direction and would expect the majority to be on the pipe when we get into full-field development mode.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. That's useful. And then, maybe just my question would be around cash priorities. You clearly \u2013 you made very clear the ability to reinvest into the portfolio and that being a priority. But, you've also been very careful about emphasizing that you would be spending within cash flow, including the dividend. So, maybe if you could just address the dividend, rather you would consider that just to be a number, we should think it as flat going forward or if there's any plan for progress of within the dividend or does the same logic apply as it does to share repurchases? Then, maybe just sneak one more in the back of this because of the write-down of the deferred tax assets, can we assume that you won't be a cash payer in the U.S. for foreseeable future?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Let me talk little bit about the dividend and maybe Pat can chime in on the valuational allowances that we took this past quarter. But, from a cash on balance sheet kind of standpoint right now again our number one objective is, as we look back to 2016, was to ensure that we had the financial flexibility to deal with ranges in commodity prices, but also near-term debt maturities, with, again, a goal of directionally reducing our gross debt. We also clearly want to be able to participate in resource capture if that looks like it may be on offer in the market. And so in that kind of call on those funds, today, we don't really see the value being generated to the shareholder through returning cash in the form of dividend. But, again, that's a decision that we'll continue to evaluate in the future as we see our business continue to grow.","Patrick J. Wagner - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay. This is Pat. As you mentioned, we did take the record valuation allowance of $1.3 billion in the quarter. That was triggered by an expected cum pre-tax loss in recent years. For modeling purposes moving forward in 2017, you should assume that there is no cash taxes in the U.S. and no U.S. deferred tax benefit or expense for the year.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Very clear. Thanks, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, gentlemen. Good morning to you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, I guess, I was going to kind of ask you that cash flow question. So thanks, for taking care of that. I guess maybe, a second way to think about things, given the overall layout here not just for 2017, but the longer term CAGR. What would you take your foot off to gas on most likely if we don't get the $55 oil price either as in average for 2017 or if we have a speed bump here out there in 2018 or 2019 or something like that? Is it Eagle Ford? Is it Bakken? It doesn't sound like it would be Oklahoma unless things were pretty dire again?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I would say, Roger, that clearly, Oklahoma for us really is a strategic objective to get that asset ready for full-field development. And, beyond that, the other investments in our portfolio are largely discretionary in terms of they are driven by economic returns. And so, if we felt that we needed to modulate activity, we would do that based on making a reasonable view of returns in addition to looking at the scale efficiencies that exist in the basin. So, it'd be a bit of a gain they call along on how we would approach that. But, we're going to deliver on the requirements in Oklahoma.","And, I'd also maybe point out that, you know, in that scenario things like our commodity risk management through hedging also come into play. And, we've been very intentional about putting on a defensive hedging strategy that will underwrite the strategic elements of our business plan to ensure that we don't end up in a situation where that \u2013 those elements of our plan come under pressure.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. And then, I guess, a little bit back to the balance sheet, obviously, the plan to pay off some debt this year. Should we look at future debt repayment as opposed to debt refinance as we see future maturity dates?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","So, I think, what we've talked about, Roger, is that, we want to protect the flexibility to deal with those maturities based on the business environment at that point in time. We haven't really telegraphed whether that means re-fi on some, or pay down on others, or even tendering at some point. I mean, those are all options that would be on the table, but we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to deal with those in the most efficient manner that we can. And so, that's the way I would think about it. But, directionally, you are correct. We will be looking to reduce gross debt.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next questions comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors (38:49). You may begin.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. And, thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about your annual capitalized costs per rig line in the Bakken STACK and Eagle Ford, can you just talk about where that is? And then, with the improved well designs and kind of larger completions, how that changes through the year or are there any changes to that?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, David. It's a bit more complicated than that, I guess, I would say. And the reason is, coming back to some of the discussion we had earlier on the call. You know, we've got different completion designs for different well types, whether that was in the Bakken. Obviously, in Oklahoma, we've got SL wells, XL wells, STACK wells, some SCOOP wells. And then in the Eagle Ford, we've got multiple development concepts there depending on the specific areas reservoir stratigraphy, fluid type et cetera.","So, I think, you know, what I would maybe point you to back to the Bakken specifically, and Oklahoma to some degree. As we're moving to the activity levels that we're headed towards, requires us to build a bit more operational inventory than we would have in the past, where at lower activities, you drill it and go immediately complete it to make sure we utilize our frac crews the most efficiently, we need a little bit of operational inventory there.","We've also got the refrac program in Bakken, which is consuming part of the capital up to 25 refracs there. So, it's really hard to put a specific number on a rig line. And we touched early in the call as well, of course, we built some net inflation offset by some efficiencies in all these basins, but we just don't see value given our ongoing discussions to put a number out there.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. So $100 million per rig line, rough number $110 million, that includes refracs and some changes in plans. So, that isn't a great run rate is what it sounds like. (41:10) \u2013 a third of your capital with six rigs in two different plays is about $110 million; $100 million per play is the simple math.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, but that's a simple math, I think as Mitch kind of outlined David, it's not that quite that simple.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Exactly.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Of course in Oklahoma you still have a big non-operated slice in Oklahoma, you got the complexity in the Bakken of having a little bit of drill, but uncompleted inventory, probably a bit more than we typically had there by year end coupled with a relatively aggressive recomplete or refrac program in Hector. And, so there are some moving parts in there to make the math a little less straightforward, if you're trying to search kind of for our capital efficiency number per rig.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right. That's kind of what I was getting to. Maybe on the other direction...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","...just completely, so cash flow plus dividends. I mean, cash flow equals CapEx plus dividend. At $55 oil, it's kind of a $2.5 billion run rate into next year is what it roughly gets into, $600 million in the fourth quarter is our run rate; that matches. So, is that a fair exit rate for CapEx, around $600 million?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I mean, it's \u2013 I think you described though the objective very well, David, which is, you know we are matching basically our operating cash flow. We want that to cover our capital program as well as our dividend. And so, we've calibrated that on a average WTI for the year of $55 oil, and so that's the modeling that we're doing today.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Kind of no answer. Thanks, guys. What if I (43:02) shot at 2018.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH. You may begin.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up to David's question maybe looking at it at a different way. Looking through your previous presentations, you guys talked about $4 million well costs in the Eagle Ford and about a $6 million well cost in the Bakken. And so, looking at your net well count and then kind of the total capital budgets in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken, just trying to understand the delta in the net CapEx you're laying out, about $600 million in each play versus what the implied kind of well build-up would be from a bottom-up perspective.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. We haven't. And, again, we haven't really provided the phasing of that over time. But, you know, in somewhere like the Eagle Ford, where we are already at a somewhat steady maintenance level, you should expect wells to sales to be somewhat ratable through the quarters. And the areas where we're on a much deeper ramp-up, that's going to vary. For instance, in the fourth quarter in Oklahoma, we only had eight wells in total to sale. So, with early on pad drilling and lower rig capacity in places like Oklahoma, at least in the early days of the year, it's going to be a little bit lumpy and bumpy in terms of when those wells to sales come to fruition.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just a question around kind of the inventory side of the equation, it's been a while since we've seen a inventory update in both the Bakken and Eagle Ford, and I was just curious if you can provide us some context, I guess, as we look at the run rate of about 100 wells or so in the Eagle Ford today and about 60 wells or so in the Bakken in the core, how you guys kind of think about the core inventory depth you have in terms of years. Just trying to get a better sense of how we should think about that inventory as we progress over the next five, six years.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Matt. This is Mitch. Maybe I'll start with the Bakken. And, we're allocating two-thirds of our CapEx up there this year to the Myrmidon area. With that kind of activity level, certainly see several years of inventory. Just in Myrmidon, we talked as well we're looking to extend our high intensity completion designs down to the Hector, but we've got about twice the position. And, certainly, with success there, we would extend that another several years as well.","To your Eagle Ford question, more than sufficient inventory to drive the long-term growth CAGRs that we talked about earlier on the call and in our release. And, certainly, the Eagle Ford, as Lee mentioned earlier, is going to play a role in that growth. So not uncomfortable with the inventory in either of those basins. We've been working hard on finalizing our 2017 activity plans and making sure we're prepared to execute on the ramp-up. So still working resource updates across the company, across all three basins, and we'll try to share that with you all in due course.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Campbell with Tuohy Rose. You may begin.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","There was mention of secondary zone tests in the Midcon. I was wondering if you'd add some color on what zones you might be looking at in the STACK and the SCOOP, specifically. And, also, will any of these tests be operated or are they all passive?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Hey, Jeff, this is Mitch, again.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Hi.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Not really ready to provide a lot of color on specific targets. I guess, I would point you to our slide in the deck with the strack (47:17) column. And, we've kind of highlighted ones. You could probably pick those from activity in the area. They will \u2013 we are referencing primarily company-operated tests there. So, those will be tests that we'll be executing on. And, obviously, as we get a little further into that, we'll share details as appropriate.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","But, I think...","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, maybe if I could just ask as a quick follow-up to that is, just will this be fairly even testing across your acreage or are you concentrating a little bit more on the STACK versus the SCOOP or vice-versa?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. That's fair. I would say the concentration will be more weighted in the STACK.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. My other question was with regard to the Eagle Ford. And, you mentioned that there was going to be increased lateral lengths. I was just wondering if you have an average lateral length target for 2017, and also if you have a corresponding EUR estimate for that length?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","No. We're looking at a little bit longer lateral lengths there. As you're I'm sure familiar, the lease boundaries in Texas aren't as consistent as they are in areas like Oklahoma. So, we have some unique shapes. And the program is weighted towards some more 7,000-foot laterals in 2017 than we were in 2016. We talked about, in the release as well, you know, we've brought 52 wells to sales last quarter. In aggregate 30-day IPs are right on the type curve, and top 10 wells kind of range from 1,400 boe per day to 2,100 boe per day, but nothing really further to share on that at this point.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So, it sounds like that, even though the length is going to be 7,000 or whatever, it's not radically different than what you've been doing. And we can pretty much assume the type curves that we've \u2013 that have taken us up to this point for 2017. Is that fair?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think, I think the way I would maybe characterize it, Jeff, is that on average our lateral length is up a bit for the reasons that Mitch just described, but it's incrementally up from the average where we've been in the past.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well...","Operator","That concludes our","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Go ahead.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Zach Dailey. You may begin.","Zach Dailey","Thanks, Paulette. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Welcome to Marathon Oil's first quarter 2017 conference call. I'm Zach Dailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Also joining me this morning are Lee Tillman, President and CEO; Mitch Little, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dane Whitehead, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Last night, in connection with our earnings release, we also released prepared remarks and associated slides, which can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. Following some brief remarks from Lee, we'll open the call up for Q&A, where we'd request you ask no more than two questions, and you can re-prompt as time permits.","As a reminder, today's call may contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Please read the disclosures in our earnings release and\/in our SEC filings for a discussion of these items. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the quarterly information package on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Zach. Good morning to all and thank you for joining us today. I'll have a few opening comments, then we'll get straight to your questions. We have been resolute in our transformation of Marathon Oil from an integrated company to a globally diversified independent to the U.S. resource play focused independent E&P we are today.","We're now the only independent E&P with material positions and therefore highest return lowest-cost oil-rich basins in the U.S. We continue to execute against our playbook by strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying concentrating our portfolio, and positioning our business to grow profitably within cash flows at [moderate] oil pricing.","With our transformative transactions in the first quarter, exiting the Canadian oil sands and entering the Northern Delaware, we have further accelerated toward our strategic intent. We believe our differentiated portfolio, visibility on long-term growth within cash flows and execution strength, our foundational characteristics of a business model that offers a very compelling investment case for our shareholders. We have the balance sheet, cost structure and leadership to accelerate value from our portfolio beginning with the resumption of sequential growth in the resource plays in the second quarter.","We're still on plan to see this growth increase in the back half of the year, with anticipated exit production rates 20% to 25% higher than 2015. We've also raised our full-year E&P production guidance by 5,000 boe per day and successfully ramped activity to 20 drilling rigs during first quarter from 12 rigs at year-end and we currently standard at 22 active rigs inclusive of our rig in Northern Delaware.","We're on track to prepare the STACK for full-field development to maintain Eagle Ford production flat for free cash flow generation, to develop the high-value high-oil cut Myrmidon area in the Bakken, and to be running at three rigs in the Northern Delaware at mid-year. This quarter, North American production exceeded the high end of guidance, and the resource plays were flat sequentially as we prepare for growth in 2Q.","In Oklahoma, we brought to sales only the second industry black oil infill test in the normally pressured window, and it is performing in line with expectations. In Eagle Ford, our deliberate focus on the oil window increased oil production 7% sequentially, and we continue to take advantage of our scale and efficiency. In the Bakken, we continue to prove up the competitiveness of East Myrmidon via a high-intensity stimulation designs, which we're expanding to the hectare area this year.","And finally, in the Northern Delaware, we closed on the BC deal just this week, are well along in building a high-performing asset team, and look forward to our first Marathon design completion in 2Q. Our portfolio on business model have never been stronger or better positioned to adapt to a volatile commodity market, with over 95% of our capital program dedicated to the U.S. short-cycle investments.","About 60% of our total production this year will come from the resource plays, and that mix will only continue to improve as we grow the U.S business over the next five years while enhancing our returns and our margins. 2017 is poised to be an exciting year for us, and our longer-term growth plans will now benefit from optimization across four basins.","The integration of the Northern Delaware into our long-term capital allocation plan will only strengthen our confidence in delivering against our benchmark CAGRs of 10% to 12% total company, and 18% to 22% for the resource plays from 2017 to 2021 within cash flows, and at a flat $55 WTI.","Our near-term and longer-term plans are further supported by a strong balance sheet with $2.5 billion of cash and a consistent cash flow generating E.G. business that provided $160 million of EBITDAX this quarter to reinvest back into the resource plays. While we can't predict future commodity prices, we have purposefully designed our 2017 business plan to be flexible and retain the ability to respond to the macro environment with many levers at our disposal should we feel the need to adjust.","With that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons and Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber","Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Baber","Lee, my first question was. I wanted to follow-up on the last comment that you made there. So just maybe get a sense of the flexibility embedded in your current plan given some of the volatility in the market. Are they trigger points with respect to commodity prices, where you begin to pull back on the rig count at some point? I mean just given the volatility, I want to better understand how you plan to manage the business through the cycle here, and you mentioned many levers at your disposal, do you care to discuss that a bit at all?","Lee Tillman","Yes, absolutely. Maybe, Guy, just a few comments on the macro in general first, and then I'll talk a little bit about how we might respond. I still think our belief is 2017 is going to be very volatile, probably in a bit tighter band if we continue to see OPEC discipline. We do feel that supply and demand have come back largely into balance, but as we all know, storage has continued to be a bit stubborn. We're not going to even attempt to predict pricing, but as I said in my opening comments, we've really focused on making sure our business plan has the flexibility and optionality that if the fundamentals do support adjustment, not technical changes, but the fundamental support adjustment then we are ready to do so.","The levers that we have available, I think it starts with the fact that now a 95% of our capital program is in the short-cycle investments, we have minimal long-term contracts associated with our U.S. business, and we've got a balance sheet today that sits with $2.5 billion of cash and an untapped revolver. So in the event that we see the fundamentals supporting a price that is in the 40s, we've got a lot of tools available to modulate or spend and mitigate our exposure.","And obviously, we'd expect service cost to start following that price down as well. We can't have low prices and high service cost, that just can't be sustainable. So in that scenario, we're going to revert back to our capital allocation priorities. We're going to ensure that our strategic priorities in Oklahoma and the Permian, Northern Delaware are met, and then we're going to take a hard look at our discretionary investments based on the available cash flows.","Guy Baber","That's very helpful. And then I wanted to ask an operational follow-up, but the Eagle Ford results this quarter looked especially strong. Can you maybe talk a little more about those enhanced completions there, the intensity of those completions, lateral links, what you're seeing with inflation as well? The $4 million well costs would seem to indicate you aren't seeing much of there. And then you look like you had some really good results in Southeast Atascosa County as well outside of your typical Karnes focus area. Can you talk a little bit about that, and how that might influence your go-forward plans in the Eagle Ford?","Mitchell Little","Yes, absolutely. Guy, this is Mitch. A number of questions in there, I'll try to hit them all, but check me if I miss one along the way. But you've seen us move up our completion intensity over the back half of 2016 and into 2017. The majority of our wells were pumping at 2,000 pounds per foot, 200 foot stage spacing in the oil window, which is where the majority of our program is concentrated.","We've been in the process extending those enhanced completions down to the Southwest as you referenced in Southeast Atascosa, and really pleased what we're seeing there on those Guajillo pads that we released. And even as you extend that up on trend to the Franke May A pad where we pumped a little bit higher intensity, early results are certainly encouraging.","We've got a number of additional tests that we'll be bringing online through the year, and with a little bit more production history and confirmation from those tests, we're encouraged by kind of upgrading that inventory and making it competing quite favorably with the rest of our Eagle Ford portfolio there, so certainly very encouraged by that.","On the inflation side, like many are seeing, they're variable by service line, but seeing some pressure on the completion services side. But thus far, the teams are working really hard and focused on offsetting the majority of that. We noted a new record well performance at over 4,000 feet a day, about a 1\/4 of the wells were delivered at 3,000 feet a day.","And that\u2019s why we were standing up a couple of cold-stacked rigs which we added late last year, so pleased with that. We're also tweaking designs, the completion recipe, reducing some of the higher cost elements to offset some of that. So certainly a bit of pressure there, but we've been successful in mitigating the majority of it. And the teams are focused on continuing to innovate and find operational efficiencies to keep that under control.","Guy Baber","Great, thanks for the comment.","Operator","Our next comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Maybe let's start out in the Yost infill pilot. You had some solid results there in the pilot. Can you give a little more color on takeaways from the six wells, including any change to your thoughts on, if there's been any change in your thought on proper spacing within a unit? And should we expect to see these shifts to longer laterals going forward?","Mitchell Little","Absolutely, Ryan, as you said and as we noted, the Yost is the second full section infill in the black oil window. We're pretty satisfied with the early results there, matching our expectations. We've got taken away a number of learnings there, probably the main take away is that six well per section density confirms our base case when we made the PayRock acquisition.","As we go throughout the year, including the Hansens infill, that's next up. We're going to test a little bit tighter density and add another well in the Meramec per drilling unit, also taking a look at the learnings from the Yost's pilot, tweaking the completion design a little bit and testing a bit of a gap out from the parent well. ","In that particular case, we see a little bit higher fracture, natural fracture intensity around the parent well. And so it's appropriate to modify the design for that particular spacing unit. And keep in mind, we design spacing at the individual spacing unit, integrating the subsurface data, micro seismic and other fracture characterization techniques that take into account the local rock mechanics and fracture characteristics that we can model.","But early in the program, we're pleased with the results, the productivity. The Yost's pilot was also a little bit shorter than full section, about 4,600 foot lateral length, so thus far so good, I'd say we're encouraged and have kind of confirmed the base case assumption in that acquisition, and we'll continue to take our learnings and apply additional optimization to the next few as we optimize ultimate spacing for that area.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And should we expect to see a lateral length increase as you move forward in the area?","Mitchell Little","We've got a portion of our acreage that's amenable to XLs. What we have seen thus far is that the SLs on a per lateral foot or capital efficiency basis are competing and in some cases, exceeding the performance of the XLs. So we don't see necessarily that XL is the right approach in the black oil normally pressured window.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks that's helpful and then maybe just some thoughts around your full-year guidance. I mean, the volume looks great in 1Q, 2Q guidance was a little bit better than we were expecting in your completion schedule is certainly back-half weighted towards \u2013 as we move through the year. I mean, how do you see about the potential? Is the full-year guidance at this point, does it feel conservative given what you're seeing? Is there \u2013 how do you think about the potential for that to move higher over the course of the year?","Lee Tillman","Well, we feel confident in our ability to deliver against the revised guidance, Ryan and I think we've done a lot of good work. You've seen in the first quarter, essentially a flattening of the resource plays, we're essentially flat sequentially there, which sets us up very favorably now with the uplift in activity to get back on that sequential growth track. But your observation, of course, of that gaining momentum in the second half of the year is an accurate one.","As we continue to learn more and as we feel more confident, we'll continue to re-examine that guidance each and every quarter based on actual field data. But it's still pretty early in the year for us, we're still early in the \u2013 even though we've ramped rigs, bear in mind that, that kind of the leading indicator, the completion still has to follow. And so we still have a lot of work in front of us, and we're going to watch it carefully, and update as we see appropriate.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks Lee.","Lee Tillman","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yes, good morning and congrats on the strong cash flow and the progress. I mean maybe if I could start on the Delaware, just maybe some sort of high-level comments about the time it's going to take you to delineate the acreage. Obviously, there's some very strong industry-wide results around that. And then how the response has been post-closure from the service providers in the area and the infrastructure providers, which obviously, you need to step this asset up into development mode.","Mitchell Little","Yes. Sure, Ed, this is Mitch again. Clearly, we just closed on the BC part of the deal earlier this week, but we're quickly advancing our near-term activity and appraisal plans. Through the rest of the year, the majority of the activity will be targeting Bone Spring and Wolfcamp intervals, and of course, lease protection. Nominally, we need just under two rigs dedicated to protect the leasehold. We'll certainly be doing that. And as we get later in the year, we'd expect to begin drilling a few pads.","Certainly, we see areas where sufficient delineation has already occurred and can move to optimizing well spacing in those areas. And we'll also be looking to drill a multi-bench pad, still finalizing the design on there as you might expect. But current thinking we'd be looking to test three to four benches, probably six landing zones, all in combination, gathering technology, micro seismic and other technologies that help us characterize fracture behavior and rock mechanics in the areas that are a little less delineated, and we'll be testing various well spacing there as well, likely four to six well per bench type spacing.","Building out marketing plans and infrastructure development plans in coordination with building out that detailed plan of development. So well on our way to three rigs by midyear, look forward to a busy second half of the year where we'll bring 15 to 20 wells to sales and as you mentioned, encouraged by the continued extension of the play. The BC Red light well, which was western and step-out in Eddy certainly looks good and some of the other wells that are pushing the play and also proven up some of those zones that we consider as upside targets in the acquisition. We released, or others have released a couple of nice Avalon wells over in Lee County.","Edward Westlake","Okay, great. And then switching basin, I guess, further south in the SCOOP. I mean, you've got the Springer four-well pilot coming on in the middle of the year. Obviously, your peer, Continental's talked about the Sycamore, which is above the Woodford. Maybe some general thoughts as to how the sort of SCOOP has economics or potential has changed, obviously there's been a lot of focus on some of the other areas, so within the Marathon portfolio.","Mitchell Little","Yes, sure. As you know, we will be drilling our first company-operated Springer infill down in the SCOOP. Those infill programs in the Springer oil window have really strong economics, and we're pleased to be seeing how that's developed, and we've got some running room there. Obviously, we're taking note of and paying attention to some of the Sycamore tests that are being released in that area.","Our priorities, as we've talked about previously, are moving towards full-field development in 2018, where the majority of our activities will be pad-based drilling, both in the STACK and the SCOOP. And so we're happy to learn from, we're paying close attention and watching others derisk some of these plays but we certainly have exposure to the Sycamore and the SCOOP areas as well.","Lee Tillman","But, Ed, I would just maybe add, there's no doubt that the Springer oil competes very favorably at the top of our portfolio. It's a matter of priority, that acreage is largely HBP, it held by production, so we've got the optionality to feather that into the portfolio at the appropriate time. But we're looking very much forward to the downspacing test there, and we believe it's going to compete very favorably for capital going forward.","Edward Westlake","I think that\u2019s what I was trying to get. Thank you very much Lee.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from of Evan Calio for Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio","Lee, you've restructured the portfolio for conventional basin positions and one of the most active programs in 2017, amongst all peers 20 rigs today. I mean can you discuss how you changed your organization and integrated the two new assets, or built your Permian team? And how do you think about operational capacity to execute on this big resource?","Lee Tillman","Right. Well, certainly when we did some of the restructuring in the operations side of the house last year, bringing all the operations under a single leadership, it was envisioned that we would have the optionality to transition a fourth basin into that structure. So we've built that structure with a mindset of bringing in a fourth basin into play, and making sure that we had both the technical and execution capacity available to drive that.","Clearly though, in this case where we're standing up, a full asset team, one of Tom Hellman's first priority is building out that team. And we're building that from both internal resources as well as some select external hiring. When both of those groups having a very deep knowledge in the Northern Delaware. But our operational structure as a whole was really designed to plug in a fourth basin that was part of the design from last year. So I feel very good about that.","From a capacity standpoint, Tom's well on his way of filling out the key leadership roles on the asset team. Of course, we have the transitional services agreement with BC operating as well, which provides us some incremental support. And, so we think we're off to a really strong start there, and we're absolutely looking forward to getting the first Marathon designed well down in the second quarter. But I expect very little loss of momentum there as we kind of pick up the bit there in Northern Delaware.","Evan Calio","Great. And if I could follow-up on the Yost, specifically. I mean how much, with any frac interference did you see that gives you confidence in the upcoming seven- and nine-well per section test? I mean it sounds the parent-child wells could be optimized further from your results to support an even better results than some of the offsets there have been by their operators have been strong? Just kind of any color there to follow-up on Ryan's question.","Mitchell Little","Sure, Evan. Yes, we had a really strong parent well at the Yost and also, from our subsurface integrated workflow noted some higher natural fracture intensity around that parent well. And so it's fair to say that we did see some communication impacts as we came back in and infill that. We'll take those learnings, and have taken those learnings into the Hansens.","And we do think there's optimization that can be done, and we'll be changing the completion recipe a little bit as well as the gap-out test that we're doing on that location. So very early days, we're certainly encouraged by the early results, kind of confirming the base case, but like any of these programs that you're in early days, there will be some optimization to come.","Evan Calio","Got it, I mean I'll just slip a small one in if I could, will you under lifted in 1Q? Was there an under lift in 1Q?","Mitchell Little","In the UK, yes.","Lee Tillman","UK yes.","Evan Calio","For about 6,000 barrels a day?","Lee Tillman","We have to get back to you, Evan. I think we can get back with you on that one. I\u2019ll tell you the exact number, Evan. We had essentially, yes.","Mitchell Little","We didn't have a crude lifting in Brae.","Lee Tillman","Yes. We had no crude liftings. And obviously, it got concurrent on liftings in Libya, and so it's caught up there.","Evan Calio","Okay, that was equal to sales and production. That is helpful. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yes, you bet. Thank you. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Good morning everyone. Good morning Lee.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Lee, on a Hector, you're adding a couple of rigs back in an area that I think you had previously characterized as obviously not as good as the Myrmidon, but I don't want to call it non-core, but certainly it's sort of well over 100,000 acres, if I recollect.","Lee Tillman","Correct.","Doug Leggate","Bigger completions seem to be having a fairly sizable impact on some of your peers. Can you just walk us through how Hector is emerging to compete in the portfolio because I'm guessing that's a fairly large oil inventory or oil levered inventory that could be significant in your outlook?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Your observations are spot on. The Myrmidon area, we typically characterized as being around 60,000 net acres. The Hector area, as you correctly stated, is around 115,000 net acres. I think we would absolutely have characterized Hector as being a lower tier from a quality standpoint to Myrmidon, but the same modeling that we employ to give us confidence and the response we would see in the Myrmidon area from the higher intensity completions.","We've applied that of course, in the Hector area using the production data that we also have available there and feel confident that we're going to see uplift there and the potential of course to drive those to compete. They compete today, but certainly, we're looking to take them really to the next level. We've seen great response West and East Myrmidon, and now it's really the extension of that into the Hector area, and we'll see kind of the first wells to sales really in the Hector area in the second quarter of this year.","I don't know, Mitch, if you want to add anything else.","Mitchell Little","I think you covered it well. We have done the same technical workflow, seen very material improvements in the Myrmidon area, and we're certainly hopeful that we'll see that same type of uplift or a significant uplift on the Hector program and with the twice the acreage position down there, certainly encouraging results would lead to a nice enhancement to a big part of our portfolio up in the Bakken.","Lee Tillman","I would also, maybe just add that a lot of our recomplete opportunities also sit in the Hector area, and we expect to have good response and good success from that as well.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up if I may, Lee is a couple I guess over a year-ago, now you were one of the first to put out a chart that kind of characterized your economic inventory by area and by oil price. I'm just wondering obviously the portfolio has changed an awful lot in that time, could you characterize how you would see the incremental dollar? I realize a rising oil price is not a scenario anyone's catching right now, but how does the \u2013 what's the relative economics today in terms of what's the best part of your portfolio today if oil prices continue to fall?","Lee Tillman","Yes. Setting the absolute price aside for a minute, and talking about relative economics in the portfolio, we would still see kind of occupying that top spot in the portfolio today. The Meramec black oil window, the [indiscernible] oil window in the Eagle Ford, West Myrmidon and now, of course, Northern Delaware, Wolfcamp and Bone Spring. I would also argue, even, though we didn't necessarily feature it on the chart, some of the earlier dialogue around the Springer formation, some of those wells would be quite competitive. And as we're successful in uplifting things like East Myrmidon and Hector, we want to drive those toward that absolute top tier as well.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I appreciate the answer. Lee, thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, Lee.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey","When you started out \u2013 during your commentary, you said that Marathon is unique as far as you're majorly positioned in all four plays in U.S. unconventional, that's not something the market really likes, in so far as it would prefer focus. Can you talk \u2013 but it's also very interesting position, obviously, because you have the view of all four. Could you sort of justify why you would want to be in all four simultaneously, and why given the information you presumably have, you wouldn't just focus on one aggressively? Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think multi-basin approach does provide some inherent advantages. And I think, first of all, it's a multi-basin approach in four basins that are resource plays and oil-rich resource plays, so it's very consistent with our strategic intent. But we see a great deal of value in having resource plays that are at various points in their developmental cycle. Being able to transfer learnings from the scale and efficiency that we've delivered in places like the Eagle Ford, and drive that into day one, into places like now Oklahoma and Northern Delaware, we see as an inherent advantage in the multi-basin model.","Additionally, if you're looking to ensure that you can drive competitive growth and do that within cash flows, having mature assets, more mature assets that can be modulated between growth and free cash flow generation, we also see as a significant advantage. So the sharing, the learnings, the best practices that you can drive from our experiences in places like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.","And now we'll also start seeing reverse integration from the newer plays where the Oklahoma teams or the Northern Delaware teams provide us insight that can be plowed back into our basins like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. All of that, to us provides some implicit advantages. And all four basins also have very unique product mixes as well, that again, allow us a little bit different exposure and a little different optimization, depending upon what we see in the market.","So we do see some advantages in the multi-basin model. We like the fact, of course, that, that model is first and foremost focused though in those four resource plays that are of very high quality and very oil-rich.","Paul Sankey","Yes. I think the perspective of different phases of development is interesting. It feels as if there was one that would be the Bakken that needs the higher price and would be the less attractive and presumably, you'd want more Permian if you could get it.","Lee Tillman","Yes. I think the Bakken \u2013 that statement I likely would've agreed maybe 18 months ago. But I think with the Bakken, particularly in the geologically advantaged areas like Myrmidon, where we've seen such a strong response to the higher intensity completion designs, it has elevated at quite frankly on an economic basis, eye to eye with the best in our portfolio.","Paul Sankey","Right, interesting and then just a follow up I guess, what we were talking about the spill of your assets. One big question amongst everyone about, if you like, the threat from U.S. unconventional growth that you're very much a part of is the non-U.S. non-OPEC decline rates. Can you make any observations first about that, as far as Marathon and then as far as the globe is concerned? Thanks.","Lee Tillman","So Paul, I think just from a Marathon Oil standpoint, our international portfolio, operated portfolio is now really largely dominated by one big resource, which is of course, our EG asset, which is a long-life, relatively low-decline asset. I think that as you expand that perspective outside of Marathon's portfolio, the bottom line is that the conventional world does have a finite decline in those reservoirs. And I think that's been a little bit masked by some of the long-cycle investments that have FID decisions that were taken really three to five years ago coming to fruition over the last couple of years.","So that decline is there. I think we're going to start seeing that much more visibly as we move forward in time and see this lack of the, I'll say, the longer-cycle barrels coming into the market. And again, presuming continued discipline with OPEC, I think the balance is there, and it's now just a matter of seeing a more consistent drawdown in storage.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, Lee. And if I could just say that our clients and we appreciate the relatively short prepared comments and the longer Q&A. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Yes, we like that model as well, Paul. Thanks for that feedback.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","Since we're going around the horn from shale play to shale play here. I wondered if you could talk to at the cost inflation profile, cost profiles, and ability to execute that you're seeing in the Eagle Ford versus the Bakken versus Oklahoma from particularly reflecting on midstream facilities in people?","Mitchell Little","Sure, Brian. I touched on that a bit about later, if I understood your question, really, guided around inflation and pressures sort of by basin. Similar to the efficiency gains we've seen in the Eagle Ford, where not only are we drilling record pace wells and a more \u2013 higher fraction of the wells, hitting that 3,000-foot per day mark. The Bakken team also delivered three pacesetter wells early this year. First one in the first quarter, and a couple in the second quarter. And we're seeing efficiency on the drilling side pick up materially and on the frac efficiency side across these basins.","The Eagle Ford pump record stages per crew in the month of March as well. We do see as we're standing up new rigs and new frac crews, a little bit of a learning curve at the start, but we're making good progress in all three basins, and quickly getting them to pace with our more continuous operations. So we've been successful in offsetting the majority of the inflation that we've seen to date. There's still going to be work to do there and teams are focused.","A couple of specific examples where we're changing the completion recipe to eliminate some of the higher cost elements of the design, changing the well design in the Bakken, which eliminates the need for a tieback string and saves a number of operational days, not seeing any difficulty in sourcing materials. We're also focused on the commercial side with unbundling some of the services, doing some direct sourcing of sand and fuel and other services. So it's a full-court press by all of our asset teams to protect the margins that we worked so hard for during the last couple of years.","Brian Singer","Thanks. And then in the Eagle Ford, you highlighted a number of strong 30-day rates in the Guajillo south area. I wondered if you could more broadly talk to what your latest thoughts are on spacing, and then whether the types of rates that you're reporting here are what we should expect more broadly over the Eagle Ford program.","Mitchell Little","Sure Brian. We've got an extensive position across the Eagle Ford, as you're well aware, 150,000 acres-plus, and spread out across a few counties there and through a few different phase windows. But we are moving as a base design to this \u2013 we have moved as a base design to this 2,000 pound per foot on 200-foot stage spacing in the oil window. We're seeing a nice uplift from that in the early days, and we're getting more run time on that and seeing some of that hold in pretty well.","Extremely encouraged by the extension of that down to the Southwest here in Atascosa. We'll have a number of additional pads coming on to try to confirm those results, but I would say, pretty consistently seeing uplift benefits from that higher intensity completion design. Continue to trial like we did in the Franke May, even higher intensity, which was like 2,500 pounds per foot. So we're encouraged. Like to get a little bit more production history behind us in this area down to the Southwest in particular and a few more pads to confirm that. But very encouraging early results and we would expect to be able to repeat that.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. As I look at your CapEx spend in Q1 and the increase in full-year guidance, it looks like a very backend loaded picture. So is my math right that you can be spending around $750 million per quarter by Q4? Is that accurate?","Lee Tillman","Yes, that's very accurate. I mean obviously, the first quarter, we were in a bit of a ramp up phase. And so capital was on our plan, but obviously lower than what the ratable spend rate is going to be for the next three quarters, because we're really now hitting our stride, we're bringing completions on now. We're really starting to hit the pace of true development that we thought we would for the remainder of the year. So you should think of that $2.4 billion budget now being pretty ratable across the next three quarters.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, understood. And as you've three months ago, talked about your kind of 15% to 20% long-term target growth rate at $55 WTI, obviously, today we're at 20% below that. How long do you have to see oil prices below let's say sub-50 before you decide to pull back on your growth trajectory?","Lee Tillman","Yes. It's hard to give a firm timeline on that. But the way I would describe it is, is we would have to see that sustained lower pricing, and that pricing supported by the fundamentals we observed in the market, i.e. it's supported by supply and demand and storage fundamentals, not just technical trading.","And so we're not going \u2013 we're very wary of adjusting our full-year plans on the day-to-day fluctuations in oil price. Very difficult for me to see what has fundamentally changed, for instance from this week to last week from a fundamental supply and demand standpoint.","So we would have to see a sustained lower pricing in concert with the fundamental saying that that's now where the market sits before we would start taking adjustments and modulating our spend. The good news for us is that we can respond very rapidly and very effectively in the event that we observe that set of parameters.","Pavel Molchanov","All right, very clear. Appreciate it.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Mitchell Little","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold","Could you discuss a little bit on your, I guess delineation plans? What is the needed yet to delineate in the STACK? And maybe I'll just throw my follow-up question at you right away too. When you look at big picture, you talked about two rigs needed for lease maintenance in the Permian. Could you just discuss what that is for the STACK, and maybe a couple of others just to give us a sense of what the sort of base lease maintenance is versus discretionary drilling going forward?","Mitchell Little","Sure, Scott. I'll take the first one on delineation plans in the STACK. I would say what we're keenly focused on is making ourselves ready for full field development in 2018, where the majority of our activity is going to be on pad drilling. And so we've got a number of infill tests and pilots that we want to do to optimize well spacing in the Meramec across that.","We have been doing some additional delineation to the south and to the east, pretty small data set at this point, but fair to see like you would expect with any delineation program, some mixed results there. We've got a number of other things that we want to test, both to the south and the east in terms of completion optimization, artificial lift and flow back optimization. But the majority of our activities are really focused on prepping us for full field development in 2018 in both STACK, where the most concentrated activity will be, and SCOOP.","I mentioned earlier on Permian in terms of leasehold protection, nominally two rigs to hold the valuable leasehold there. I think we've talked about three in the STACK combined between the PayRock acquisition that we made last year and some of our legacy leasehold position there. So that's the type of near-term rig activity that we'll have devoted to those lease protection.","Scott Hanold","So generally, what I'm hearing is we roll into 2018, I mean the vast majority of your programs are really going to start to look much more developmental. I guess the Permian will still going to be a bit of a work in process, I would assume, but it seems like in pretty much the other three areas, pretty developmental, is that fair?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I think, Scott, that's very accurate. I think the only caveat I might put on that is that clearly, in the STACK and the SCOOP, we're talking of moving into development mode in the major primary targets, Meramec, Woodford and potentially, Springer as well. And suffice to say, there's still a lot of other potential there than we see in the other zones. But in those primaries zones, absolutely we're moving into development phase in 2018.","As you rightly state, Northern Delaware is still a bit earlier, but we're going to look to accelerate up that curve as quickly as we can using not only our own information as we get into the second half of this year, but certainly, leveraging what is a tremendous amount of industry activity. I think currently across Eddy and Lee County, there's about a little over 30 rigs running.","Scott Hanold","I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris from Citi.","Robert Morris","Good morning, Lee and team.","Lee Tillman","Hey, Bob good morning.","Robert Morris","Good morning. Some nice results on the Yost pilot that you announced this morning. You now have a peer that's drilled a pilot with 2-mile laterals in the normal pressured oil window here and certainly, on a per lateral foot, the Yost is cuming more over 60 days, although it's a little bit higher proppant loading on your pilot. Can you tell us again just why you think the sort of laterals are the better way to go here, and sort of now that you've got a peer comp there, whether that reinforces your view or kind of maybe has you thinking a little bit about the longer laterals, or why just you think the shorter laterals of the better way to go here?","Mitchell Little","Sure, Bob. As you said, the early results, and we do have to keep in mind it's early, but the early results would suggest the combination of shorter laterals in our completion design is yielding a bit better productivity. That's consistent with what we saw in earlier wells, where the single laterals, parent wells where the single laterals were competing favorably. And in many cases, from a returns basis, which is really our focus. We're outperforming the extended laterals. So we don't see anything to date that would disqualify that thinking. We'll continue to watch it and test different concepts. But at this point, we believe the combination of our completion design and single laterals is the way to go.","Lee Tillman","And then maybe, I would just add, too, Bob. We're going to go with the lateral design that we think generates the highest return. And so consequently, if you look at our completion design in the volatile oil window, we are looking at and we have been using and completing XL wells. So we're kind of \u2013 we're a bit agnostic on lateral length, we're more focused on returns and value generation. And it's great to have this 40 IPs, but at the end of the day, we're really going to be returns-driven.","Robert Morris","Certainly. That makes sense. Looking at the last two quarters, again, in the Meramec area, you reported some wells that were outperforming the 940 MBOE-type curve by about 30%. On the Yost pilot today, they're tracking right on that 940 MBOE-type curve on the 60-day cumes. Any reason why the pilot's right on the type curve where the single wells you report the last two quarters were exceeding that type curve?","Mitchell Little","I don't think there's anything that we would point out as any long-reaching conclusion on that, Bob. As with all of these plays and as with all type curves, there's some variability around the average type curve, which is what we put out and what we would expect for a larger program basis and so there are some variability in geology across the play, and probably, would characterize it more to do with that than anything else at this point. We're in the early days with only two full section infills in the black oil and more optimization to be done. So I don't think any long-reaching conclusions could be made from that data set.","Robert Morris","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks and congrats again.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Thanks. Good morning.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","A lot of stuff has been covered. I guess one thing to ask about. Tom, you made the Northern Delaware acquisitions, you referenced that there would be some swaps and other kind of acreage exchanges. Just wondering \u2013 I know it's early, but kind of where are you in that process and what should we look for? And is there desire to just generally expand that? Or is it really to think about kind of the equivalent current acreage and just working to get a more cohesive set of acreage?","Lee Tillman","I think right now, Roger, I would kind of classify it as really the latter. We're really trying to further consolidate our operated positions to the extent that we can get more capability to do longer laterals as well in both the Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp, so that's really our focus. The good news is that there's a very cooperative operator group in this area in of core operators that have the same interest.","In other words, they have the same drivers as we do to try to drive that consolidation. So even though we're in the very early days, rest assure that the asset team is already focused on the opportunity to continue to consolidate and core up our acreage position there. But in terms of overall scale and scope, obviously, we're very happy with the position we've established through the two acquisitions.","Roger Read","And what do you think the right \u2013 what would be your target length for laterals out there? Is it the 10,000 foot, the way we should think about it? Or it might be more reasonable to say around 7,500 foot or something along those lines?","Lee Tillman","Yes. I still think it's early days, Roger. Certainly, there appears to be some enhanced economics. We're certainly stepping out to the 7,500-foot length. We'll just have to see. Even though there's a lot of activity, we still don't have a lot of horizontals on the ground out there that are testing, not only lateral length, the completion designs, spacing designs. So I think it's still a bit too early to draw any direct conclusions, but certainly having the optionality to push lateral length out further is desirable. When we talk about our Northern Delaware acquisitions in the risk locations, we said, about half of our risk locations were amenable to longer laterals. And we would clearly like to drive that number higher to have that optionality in the future.","Roger Read","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the $161 million of EBITDAX out of Equatorial Guinea for Q1, is there a tax leakage we need to consider on bringing this back to the U.S.? Or is that a pretty close to a one-for-one kind of ratio?","Dane Whitehead","Yes. It's really a one-for-one ratio. This is Dane. We have ample tax attributes to enable us to move cash around the globe without incurring any tax leakage. I mean the same tax in the U.S. from E.G.","Roger Read","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thanks Roger.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter. Lee, thinking about your earlier remarks on operating in four basins. You've already mentioned Marathon completions and potentially longer laterals, implying potential upside for prior operations in the Northern Delaware Basin. I was just wondering if you see potential for any further improvements, for example better zone landing or maybe less drilling time to total depth.","Lee Tillman","Absolutely. I think as we look at where the Northern Delaware sits on the maturity cycle, there is an immense amount of running room in not only improving the productivity of the completion designs, but also driving costs down on the wells themselves. I mean, as we compare and contrast the designs for instance, the BC operating was using to the designs, that we will start trialing really in the second quarter, we just see a lot of running room there and a lot of opportunity for further optimization.","It's very early. We're anxious just like you guys are to get out there and get busy and get our own designs in the ground. But I think we're just starting to really see the potential and the learning curve in Northern Delaware, like I said, both from productivity as well as a capital efficiency standpoint.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thank you. And then as a follow-up, thinking about your references to impending multi-well pad designs mainly in the Northern Delaware Basin, your various Kingfisher test show the Osage underlying. And I was just wondering if it turns out that the Osage proves commercial in some of those areas, is there any concern regarding returning to your existing pads you drill that interval?","Mitchell Little","Yes. Thanks, Jeff. As you note, the STACK has multiple perspective intervals, and the Osage is emerging. There's very few tests that are showing STACK, Meramec and Osage combined development, it's something we're going to have to study. We've got extensive data sets to look at the rock mechanics of that.","It's not something that we've trialed yet, and I'm not aware of other trials of any extent to that. So it's something we'll have to evaluate and study over time. But there are also areas with Woodford potential underlying the Meramec. So we can expect to see over time multi-bench development there, but it hasn't been the near-term focus.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And the reason I asked you this is because even in the Permian Basin, you have some operators that are moving towards this multi-well mega pad kind of model. And then you've got others that just go in and drill all Wolfcamp base until they get them done, and then they go and do the Wolfcamp base and so forth. So I just wondered if there was any geological constraint to taking that lateral approach in the STACK, and it sounds like there's not.","Mitchell Little","None that we're aware of at this point that it's certainly going to be somewhat basin-specific. And of course, in the Permian and in the Northern Delaware, we see up to 6,000 foot section there and individual benches of several hundred feet, in some cases, and then good vertical separation between that and the next bench, so even less likely that that's going to be an issue for many of the benches in the Northern Delaware. As you get closer in vertical proximity, then it needs to become more of a consideration.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you guys could \u2013 it's been about a year since you guys announced the PayRock acquisition. If you can maybe go through and maybe summarize some of the delineation activities, and how you think the acquisition was measuring up to your expectations thus far?","Mitchell Little","Absolutely, Arun. We've been releasing a number of wells over the past few quarters, and I think the Yost infill would be the most recent in the first full section infill test in the black oil window that we've delivered, which is hitting early expectations right on the type curve. We've released a number of wells in the core that are at or above the type curve. And so I would say, we're very pleased with the results that we've delivered there.","As you might guess, when we did our evaluation for the more untested or less delineated areas, we valued them appropriately, and so a little bit of higher variability in those results is not unexpected either. So we're still very pleased with acquisition. We're pleased that the Yost infill is confirming our base-case assumption, and with the additional pilots that we have later this year, we'll be testing higher density and it seems that we'll be pushing in that direction.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Then just my follow-up, the fact that you guys are now in four different key shale basins, does that provide, you think a benefit as you deal with in a major service operator's just given the more some of the challenges we anticipate or likely to see in terms of the supply chain?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think it does afford us the advantage of scale. It also provides us some optionality in the way we approach our commercial discussions as well. We're able to actually share term across the basins as well as alter, say, rig specifications because we take a fleet management strategy versus a basin-centric strategy, and so being able to apply that scale when you're running a 20 plus rig program is very important. And obviously, we get the attention of our service providers because of that scale and scope.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Arun.","Mitchell Little","Thanks, Arun.","End of Q&A","Operator","And we're showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Lee Tillman for closing comments.","Lee Tillman","Well, thank you again for your questions today and your interest in Marathon Oil. We believe our strategy of focusing the business on profitably growing production from our high quality inventory and four of the best oil basins in the world while maintaining a strong balance sheet with a competitive cost structure positions us very favorably to outperform the competition in 2017 and beyond.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Phillips, you may begin.","Chris Phillips","","Good Morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings call. I'm Chris Phillips, Director of Investor Relations. Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman, CEO and President; and J. R. Sult, EVP and CFO.","As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release. You can find those remarks and the associated slides at marathonoil.com.","As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments and answers to questions will contain forward-looking information subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Chris. Let me add my welcome to Marathon Oil second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before opening the lines for Q&A, I'd like to take a few minutes just to share a few personal thoughts.","Last week was a bit of a special week for me, this past Friday, August 1, marked my first full year as President and CEO at Marathon Oil. It's been a remarkable year of growth and positive change for our company. I am very proud of what we've accomplished in this first year.","We outlined a comprehensive strategic framework, what we call our seven strategic imperatives, as well as three tactical priorities for 2014 back at our Analyst Day in December. And we made great strides in advancing against these commitments toward our stated goal of the becoming premier independent E&P company.","We have accelerated activity across all three of our high quality U.S. resource plays underpinned by a growing unconventional resource base. We have executed strategic divestitures in Angola and Norway to both simplify and concentrate our portfolio.","And finally, we've delivered direct value to our shareholders through material share repurchases and a comparative dividend.","I believe our company is fundamentally stronger today than it was 12 months ago. And I give full credit to the leadership team and our dedicated employees for embracing the changes to our portfolio and to our organization.","But I also want to acknowledge that there is much left to accomplish if we are to be recognized as a premier independent E&P company.","Many of you know that, that I have a passion in fact, my wife might say obsession for cars and racing. So, let me put it to you in racing terms. We have our car well set up. We run our qualifying laps. We even guard ourselves to spot on the grid, but the rate is just starting. And it's time for Marathon Oil to shift the next gear.","Our seven strategic imperatives drive our business strategy and they have gained great momentum across our organization as we continue to make this shift to become a competitive independent E&P.","We must continue this shift to align our strategic commitment to rigorous portfolio management, capital discipline and shareholder value. We are fundamentally striving for an organization that remains true to its core values to protect its license to operate but then also has a bias toward action, a commitment to stewardship.","That is guided by sound risk management, prolific opportunity generation, efficiency and scalability in our processes, rigorous external benchmarking and a rapid sharing of best practices.","A challenging and innovative culture well performance is not only differentiated but also rewarded.","And last but not least a culture that creates a great place to work for our motivated employees. I'm personally asking our employees to test each and every decision against our seven strategic imperatives to ensure alignment, and to make sure that we drive shareholder value and in all their daily work activities.","We understand that you, our investors, has options, that you have choices. And is our responsibility to make that compelling investment case for Marathon Oil. We must deliver consistent predictable financial and operating results, quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year with a clear focus on long-term value creation.","We must be good stewards of our shareholders trust, and our shareholders capital. For our investors and the analyst covering our company, thank you for your support and continued confidence in Marathon Oil during my initial year. And rest assured, this leadership team listens to your feedback as we strive to profitably grow our company and create long term value.","With that, let's turn our attention to the second quarter results and open up the call for your questions.","Chris Phillips","Thanks Lee. Before we open the call to questions, we would like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications, and you can re-prompt as time permits.","With that Ellen, we'll open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","","Yes. Good morning, and congratulations on the progress, particularly in the U.S. You flagged in a RISA, a 25% increase in 180-day cumes for some of the Eagle Ford wells with the new completion. I'm just wondering, what change you're seeing and if you could update us on the EURs, particularly for the condensate window, but also for the oil window?","","Lee Tillman","","Good morning, Ed. Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the completion performance that we're seeing in the Eagle Ford. As you quoted, we have a population of wells with 180 day cumes that are really generating on average 25% relative to our model type curve.","The bulk of that improvement is of course being driven by optimization of our completion design, a lot of that having to do with dropping our stage spacing down to 250 feet and below.","Our expectation is as we get a bit more data, we intend to update to a comprehensive update on the type curves a bit later in the year and at that time we'll provide some updated EURs as well.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just a separate follow-on, just on the SCOOP. Obviously, you're still drilling some good wells and adding acreage. Given the cash you've got coming in from Norway, when do you think you might accelerate your development in the SCOOP, and how would that fit into maybe acceleration elsewhere in the portfolio?","Lee Tillman","Right. Maybe I'll just kind of take the general question around. As we move toward close in the fourth quarter around our Norway transaction, of course a key question of our investors is how we intend to redeploy those proceeds. We've stated exclusively in the press release that of course the first call on that, those proceeds will be around organic reinvestment. And the confidence that we have in that organic reinvestment is really underpinned by what we've seen in our down spacing and completion optimization in both Eagle Ford and the Bakken, the continued expansion and delineation of our acreage footprint in Oklahoma.","So, as we move into our business planning process in the second part of the year, we fully expect that our further acceleration case and across really all of our resource plays, will be a key consideration in that dialog.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks very much.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Ed.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. If I could talk a little bit more about the acceleration that you've referenced. At this point, what more do you need to see in the Bakken and the Oklahoma to accelerate activity? Is it still waiting on results of pilot tests, or delineation work, or what more do you need to see at this point to deploy the cash?","Lee Tillman","One thing it's continued well performance and also of course getting those results from those comprehensive pilots. I think, as you look around the three resource plays in the Eagle Ford as we announced in the press release, we've continued to delineate our position in the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford which of course provide some potential uplift in our total resource space.","When you look at the Bakken greater than 50% of the completions that we are pursuing in the second half of the year, are explicitly testing enhanced completion designs. In addition to that in the Bakken, we're looking at moving aggressively from kind of our four wells per DSU up to six wells using basically a six by six per DSU between the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks.","And because of the nature of that pad drilling, much of those results would not be available until late 2014, early 2015. And then of course in Oklahoma, we're continuing to not only ensure that we protect our leasehold there in our high quality SCOOP acreage but as we work around, we're delineating the Southern Mississippi trend as well as our Granite Wash opportunity.","So there is a lot of activity that is going to ultimately culminate in that decision to further accelerate across our plays. And that will be part and parcel of the business planning process that we are going through currently.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","In the Bakken in particular, to potentially -- to use your racing terminology, to put your foot on the gas more? Is it going to be dependent at this point on pilot plant and completion testing, or is that still -- can you accelerate in the meantime?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I think we're going to move aggressively in the Bakken. When you look at our quality and materiality of our acreage position in the Bakken across our three core areas, Hector, Myrmidon and Ajax, we see a compelling opportunity there, hence, the uptick in our activity in the second half of the year.","And so I think that provides us a very strong foundation, should we move toward a more, a higher acceleration case in the Bakken.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Great. If I could ask one on a different strategic, a higher strategic level. You've done a lot over the past 24 months in terms of narrowing your international portfolio and narrowing your focus as a company. And if you look at the international exploration program, you're still fairly diverse in terms of taking shots around the globe.","Can you talk a little bit it about where the international exploration program fits into the broader portfolio and the newer, narrower focus of Marathon as an onshore-focused company?","Lee Tillman","Absolutely. Well, we view that the exploration portfolio has to compete for capital, not unlike the rest of the assets in our portfolio. And in terms of narrowing the focus, we feel that we have in fact narrowed the focus really into four key areas which are East Africa, Gabon, Kurdistan as well as the Gulf of Mexico.","And as we get results in those areas, we'll continue to test those assets in the exploration portfolio as to how best to monetize. Is it best for us to develop, or is it best to look for a another way to generate value for the shareholders.","So, just like our other portfolio, we continue to test our exploration assets as well to see what they're yielding in terms of results and how those maybe accretive to our shareholder.","But we're going to continue to keep the exploration program very focused, very much focused on all prone emerging place, where we can come in and add value as the operator.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks a lot. I'll leave it there.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Good morning Lee, Chris.","Lee Tillman","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","The previous question has been driving towards the potential for acceleration. I guess that you are outperforming your targets to an extent. Could you just remind us what your key targets are for the company, the ones you want us to focus on in terms of volume growth, obviously, by play, to the extent you're prepared to talk about that? It's just -- I'm looking at your slides and I see some guidance for 2014, but could you talk about, not only 2014, but also beyond and what we should think of you as capable of achieving? Thanks.","","Lee Tillman","Well certainly, for 2014, Paul, we are very committed to our greater than 30% growth across the resource plays. And that's fully consistent with our full year guidance and maybe I'll pause there for a moment, because I know this quarter is, - I'll acknowledge is a little bit messy because of the movement of Norway into discontinued operations. And hence the reason we've recast of course not only third quarter guidance but full year guidance to reflect the continuing operations element of our business.","But that new guidance fully reflects that greater than 30% growth in our unconventional resource plays. Looking ahead, I would say, we want to insure that our growth targets, which will be developed as part of our business plan are competitive and the current E&P peer group that we compare ourselves against.","I think that later in the year we'll give a little bit longer runway in terms of where we see those compound annual growth rates going in the future. But I'd like to probably hold that until we get a little bit further along in our business planning process and also have the full opportunity to evaluate the potential for further acceleration in the U.S.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Great. Thank you. My second question is, have you applied to export condensate from the Eagle Ford lightly processed up in Washington?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah, let me maybe step back on that one and take the big picture question first, which is, I think I've been pretty vocal in my external comments that Marathon is very much committed to a listing of the overall crude export ban. And we think putting our unconventional barrels into the world open market is the right answer for both producers, as well as consumers. And we want to have our barrels compete in the world open market.","So, not surprisingly with that philosophy, we are pursuing every avenue available to us to take advantage of the current regulatory environment to ensure we have the optionality to get our barrels, particularly condensate out in the market.","I'll also maybe pause on condensate for just a moment, given that there's not a industry accepted definition, I would say for condensate, let me just give you a little bit of color on our Eagle Ford production.","Our Eagle Ford production, unlike some of the other operators is actually quite heavy in terms of API. Materially more than 50% of our production in the Eagle Ford is less than 50 degree API, and that mix will vary as we change well mix over the years. But in general that mix looks pretty solid going forward.","So, we have a pretty heavy barrel in the Eagle Ford and hence our CNC, crude and condensate realizations are largely priced at LLS minus 6. Having said that, we still want to ensure we have maximum optionality of getting our barrels potentially to other markets with higher realization.","One of the ways that we're achieving that is also making sure that we maximize our volume on pipe out of the Eagle Ford. And ensuring that we get access to the water at Corpus Christi, and that work all continues to move forward.","So, I would say on multiple fronts, we continue to drive towards positioning ourselves to be ready to take our condensate into the open market.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Great. I guess, it's a long way of saying that you have applied to export?","Lee Tillman","I'll let you make your interpretation Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Thanks Lee.","Lee Tillman","Yeah, that was great question, thank you Paul.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning Lee, good morning everybody.","Lee Tillman","Hi, Dough.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","I have two also, if I may. Lee, if I could go to the Bakken, please. I'm a little curious that you are moving, obviously, to 50%, per your commentary, for the enhanced completion design. But you haven't really given as much indication as to what that means in terms of any potential change to your type curve.","So, I wonder if you could just help us help characterize what that enhanced completion then is doing for you in terms of IP rates, type curve, and maybe what the running room is in the play. And I have a follow-up, please.","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I think for us in the Bakken, Dough, there are really two things going on there. One is the down spacing that we're doing. And as we've mentioned, we've already spurred on of our 12 well spacing pilots per 1,280 DSU. So, I think that is an important element of the work that we're doing.","Implicit to those policies, well though, we also are testing these enhanced completion designs which as you stated, our anticipation is that those are going to have more deliverability that will enhance our overall type curves.","But, we need to see the data first. What I'll share is, that when you look at our current, either 2P or total resource that we've externally communicated on the Bakken, that's largely based on a kind of four well per individual horizon, per DSU.","So, as we move from six and higher, we would expect that to have an upward vector on our overall resource potential. Similarly, as we see more efficiency in our completion design, whether that's through stage spacing, through proppant loading, through slickwater hybrid fracturing or even some of the cemented liner completions that we're trying, we think that that will also be additive and be value creation and at the end of the day add to the resource space at the Bakken.","My preference is to provide more comprehensive update on our resource position a bit later in the year, but later in the fall and we will likely do that not only for the Bakken but also for the Eagle Ford as well as the Oklahoma resource basins.","So, we're still very early, I guess is the bottom line answer there Doug, but we do anticipate that those are going to be driving us toward potential resource adds in the future.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll wait on the update. My follow-up is, you obviously tried to sell the UK, and Norway's gone. The growth in North America is, obviously, pretty punchy on an absolute basis when you isolate North America. But, there is a little bit of a nutshell in the fat east over the large position in EG.","So, I'm just curious, when you look at the things that Apache came out with recently in terms of trying to concentrate the market's attention back in its North American portfolio, I just wonder if you could characterize your appetite, or perhaps your longer-term views, as to whether an international footprint for Marathon is still the right strategy, and EG in particular? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yeah, well certainly, I'll start by saying at a high level, we never view that our portfolio optimization is completed. And as I've said many times before Doug, we're going to be driven by profitability, not by geography.","As you mentioned, we have, still have operations in the U.K. internationally as well as in Equatorial Guinea. Those operations will continue to be tested in terms of their fit in our portfolio. We made an attempt to market the U.K. position and we're unable to achieve full value for our shareholders that we've elected to continue to operate there.","EG, a little bit different position in that, production relatively flat, very strong cash flows there. We also as you're aware Doug, have a pretty interesting exploration program kicking off in Equatorial Guinea here in the third quarter where we're exploring some very interesting oil potential on our current blocks.","So, we continue to see the potential for EG to have opportunities that would compete for capital within our broad portfolio. If we get to a point where that's no longer the case, then we'll have a different discussion around what are the four prospects for Equatorial Guinea?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","All right. Thanks a lot, Lee for the answers.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","","The next question is from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","","Hi, thanks. Two quick ones for you, Lee. You mentioned in the release and in your current comments and last night's comments about greater completion efficiency. Notionally, with the unconventionals, how much further do you think your spending dollars are going as a consequence of improved well designs and other operational practices?","","Lee Tillman","Well, I think we continue to be value driven. Of course we want to deliver the lowest completed well cost that we can. But we'd also want to make sure that we're mindful of generating the highest PV as well.","For instance, if you look at our standard design in a place like this, Eagle Ford, we typically have 22 stages of fracs, we typically use about \u00a35 million of proppants and we are now driving stage spacing to 250 foot. In fact, in many of our completions we are now testing even going below 250 foot.","We're also looking at various fluid loadings as well that will influence our ability to drive efficiency there. I think the learning curve continuous to exist on the completion side across all the U.S. resource plays. I think the technology continuous to move.","I think one of the advantages that Marathon has is that, we learn from all three resource plays because all have very different completion techniques and strategies. In the Eagle Ford we have plug-and-perf. In the Bakken, we're using sliding sleeve and in the Oklahoma resource basins we are using slickwater with plug-and-perf.","So, we get to see a lot of different completion designs and it's really taking the best of those and applying them for the region of interest to generate the most returns. But, in terms of the true return on that incremental investment and I'll use the example of maybe stage spacing in the Eagle Ford.","There is a cost to dropping down to more stages, more frac stages per well as you drop it stage facing to 250 feet and below. And we have tested that against the incremental value that it generates and absolutely see the return there for those incremental dollars.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Great. Next one is a follow-up on some of the other questions. If you look at your asset base, and you can either put on your VSRA hat or SCA hat, or NHRA hat as a driver, when you look at it, in terms of the spending commitment, you said earlier that everything is rated, whether it's exploration or unconventional -- or conventional versus unconventional.","On a going-forward basis, how would you lay out your spending, conventional versus unconventional? Obviously, you have commitments on the development side, but in terms of seeking new resources?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Well, I think as we talked about overall capital just to maybe review where we stand in 2014, about 60% of our capital is largely directed toward the U.S. resource plays. And I think as certainly, as we look forward into the near term particularly 2015, we still continue to see a strong case for those U.S. resource plays competing very well for capital allocation.","Now, that excludes any potential discovery in the exploration space or for instance even in the previously referenced EG exploration program which could change the dynamics there. We often talked about wanting to exercise the discipline of keeping our CapEx within our operating cash flow but we don't view that as a limiter, we view that as good discipline.","But certainly if we see great opportunities, we're willing to step outside of our operating cash flows to pursue those.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Great. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question is from Guy Baber with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the Bakken for a minute, with more of a backward-looking question, I guess, for me. But despite some weather complications earlier in the year, you appear to be easily tracking ahead of the full-year guidance that you would have given at last September's Analyst Day.","So, was just hoping you could maybe shed a bit more light as to where, specifically, you're outperforming relative to the internal plan? And maybe what has surprised you internally? Is it maybe -- is it better well results, more efficiencies? Just any more color there would be great.","","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Absolutely, we have made a strong recovery in the Bakken, post the weather impacts in the first quarter that ourselves and many other operators experienced.","But we are now tracking very well, relative to our plan. In fact, we feel that we'll be able to accommodate the various completion enhancement test, that we want to do in the second half of the year within our capital budget.","So I think we are being very efficient in the Bakken. We are seeing very strong results not only from our drilling program, but even our re-frac program that we're executing this year with a dedicated re-frac rig is also delivering very strong results. And we are about to move from the higher productivity areas of the Myrmidon to test those re-fracs also as we move into the Hector area.","So, we've had some very good results. We've had very positive results from the early four by four spacing pilots that we've implemented in the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. And that has in fact given us great confidence to move forward in the second half of the year with kind of the six by six format, the 12 wells per DSU going forward.","So, the results continue to be very positive in the Bakken.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up was, as we begin to think about the potential and possibilities around you allocating more capital to your unconventional plays, both in total, and then from one play to the next, can you just highlight for us any constraints or limits we might need to consider with respect to you all quickly ramping up investment in each of your primary plays?","Are you maybe more constrained in certain areas than in others? Anything from an infrastructure perspective, or people perspective, or anything else that you might highlight?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah, good question Guy. I think that as we think about acceleration and like I said looking toward the end of this year what actions we might have to take if an acceleration case proves beneficial. I think we have high confidence in our execution model in all three resource plays. It shouldn't be surprising that we've already kind of tested our ability to step up in terms of the ability of the service industry, whether that be frac crews or rigs to support further step up in activity.","It's a similar process that we went through last year as we tested our ability to make the first step in acceleration. So, it would just be building on that. We don't see any constraints today either from the service sector or from a rig standpoint and certainly not from an internal support standpoint that would preclude us from taking another step in terms of acceleration.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","","Thanks very much. Just wanted to talk about the pace of bringing wells to sales in the Eagle Ford. I know first quarter was a bit of a slip because of several issues, but can you talk about how many wells that you still have an inventory that need to be brought on to sales, and whether we should think about the pace moving forward as essentially same number of wells being drilled being brought into sales?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah. I think Jason that the second quarter was much more indicative of our ability to deliver wells to sales. As you mentioned, the first quarter was a bit of an anomaly as we brought new rigs into the fleet. We were also making some changes to our well designs, et cetera that was creating a little bit more measured depth on some our wells.","All of those contributed to driving some of our performance in the first quarter. The intensity also of our pad drilling, as you are well aware changed. In the first quarter we averaged about four wells per pad in the first quarter. That number has gone up to about 4.4, 4.5 now in the second quarter.","But we feel very confident now that we're generating the inventory that will keep our five fracs fleet very well loaded. Our current inventory, and again this is just a ballpark number Jason, is probably about five pads or 30 wells that we currently have in inventory.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","","Okay. Great. Then if I could just turn to the SCOOP play. I'm afraid I'm still learning about this one. Can you talk a little bit about the potential running room that you have there in terms of an inventory? And then also, obviously, the extended reach lateral had the pretty impressive flow rate.","Can you talk about the amount of irrigates that is contiguous that would support these extended reach laterals?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah. Well certainly for us, we're very bullish on Oklahoma. We've continued to grow and consolidate our acreage position there as we noted in the press release with further delineation with some acquisitions and some Greenfield leasing, we've moved our acreage position now to over 300,000 net acres. About 80% of that is in the SCOOP and STACK areas. So, we have a very deep inventory in both SCOOP and STACK as we look forward.","Again, I would say our intent is to provide a bit more of an comprehensive update on the resources associated with that acreage position a bit later in the year. But to your specific question around SCOOP XL, we've had very good success for the SCOOP XL. They're delivering outstanding incremental well economics we would compete, very favorably for capital.","Part of our consolidation and growth in Oklahoma is focused on ensuring we can maximize the inventory of XL wells that we can access. Because of course it has a lot to do with lease configuration, as well as the specific geology that you find in an individual lease.","But we absolutely want to maximize our exposure to SCOOP XL well. It's not that the SCOOP wells are poor performers. Our SCOOP wells are still delivering 1300 or equivalent barrels per day, relative to say the 2,000 that you might see in the SCOOP XL wells.","But we know when we can deliver the XL design that's exactly where we want to hit.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","","Okay, great. Could you maybe mention any uplift that you got in the IRR of the XL wells versus the standard SCOOP wells?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah, I think we've shown some incremental well economics in our last external. But certainly you're getting significant uplift in terms of return on the XL wells. Particularly, when you consider the 2000 or equivalent barrel per day, 30 day IPs.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","","Okay. Thanks very much.","Lee Tillman","But I think, IRRs, Jason are run north of 50% on those SCOOP XL wells.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning.","Lee Tillman","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Just to come back to the Eagle Ford a little bit, and I recognize we'll have more information later this year. But, can you give us an idea, as you look at the enhanced completions of the Eagle Ford there, the improvement of the 25% against the type curves, but what are you seeing in terms of additional costs? Hopefully, a lot less than the 25%. But I just hoping to get maybe an idea of the extra cost per well, and then whether or not you're seeing any -- or whether or not any service cost inflation is included in that, or if that's a relatively static event at this point.","Lee Tillman","Okay. Well certainly our current well costs in the Eagle Ford is running around from a completed well cost standpoint around $7.4 million and that of course incorporates moving to the reduced stage facing that we previously referenced.","Certainly the reduced stage spacing, Roger does put upward pressure on the target costs of our wells. However to your second question around service company costs, what we saw at the beginning of 2014 was actually some costs savings in the service sector, particularly on the pumping side as well as some of our intangible costs on OCTG.","So, we have had some other offsets as we've intensified the density of our fracs stages. We've also been able to find some offsets as well. But there is, honestly some upward pressure there.","When you just look at the, I'll call it the gross cost of stepping up the stage density, you're probably talking about 700,000 gross per well. So you are having to accommodate that level of costs in your target well cost. But that's 700,000 again is very well justified in terms of the incremental return that you're generating.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Right. Well, that's what I wanted to see. Thanks for that. And then on the second and completely unrelated question, Kurdistan. Obviously, that area is in the news almost every day, it seems like. I was just wondering, in terms of, as you're looking at your international exploration program, how that's fitting in from a capital allocation standpoint? And whether or not -- maybe you haven't had many people there, since a lot of it's not your operation. But I was just wondering whether or not you have people there, what you would need to see to put people on the ground in Kurdistan again.","Lee Tillman","Well, first and foremost, our number one priority is keeping our folks safe and secure. And so we of course just like every one have been monitoring the situation in Kurdistan very, very carefully with the developments there and Iraq with Isis.","What I can share with you is that our operations as well as the operations in our OBO operated by others blocks there, today have not been impacted by the activities there, the Kurdistan Regional Authority has had a very stabilizing influence. We simply have not seen an impact on our operations but we are monitoring it on a day-to-day basis to ensure that our folks are protected from a safety end and security standpoint.","In terms of backing away from the security question, and maybe moving forward to the - to the more geologic side of things and how it competes for capital. We have had very good success in Kurdistan. When you look at our operated block Harir, we've had the Mirawa-1 discovery. We're currently testing the Jisik-1 well. We've got the Mirawa-2 appraisal well schedule for later in the year.","So, on the operated block we feel very strongly that we've had very good geologic success there. We're still again early days. We're still doing exploration and appraisal. But it looks quite promising from a geologic standpoint.","Similarly on our non-operated blocks, we continue to make good progress there, Atrush of course is moving rapidly toward first oil. Next year that will be kind of 30,000 barrel early production system in 2015. And then on our Sarsang block, which is also non-operated, we're currently testing the East Swara Tika-1 well.","So a lot of activity there. We're thankful that that has not been impacted by the security issues in Iraq. But we're going to continue to monitor that.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Roger.","Operator","The next question is from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning, Lee. You've highlighted that you don't see any constraints to accelerate. Can you talk about, as you think about accelerating, what you see on the delta of services and drilling cost basis? And then how you offset that with efficiency? You hit the 700,000 per well increase, but makes better returns. I'm just trying to get into the base cost, apples-to-apples, of what you're saying?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah. If I look at the first half of the year, I would say that our service cost were kind of flat to down, there was still good commercial tension there. We also again as I mentioned, saw it in some our intangible goods as well.","I think though, you can sense that there is a bit more of a tightening around availability. When you look at rigs and pumping crews, particularly as the activity continues to be at a very high level and there's some rebalancing around the resource plays as you see the Permian competing for a lot of the horizontal activity as well.","So, as I look out to the second half of the year, I would anticipate that we will see a little bit of upward pressure on the services side. And we're going to have continue to work to offset any of that commercial pressure.","Now, we'll say with our scale across all three of the resource plays, we're dealing from a strong position from a negotiation standpoint because we do have a very large book of business.","The other aspect, I would point out that, as we move to longer laterals, more complex terms associated with more pad drilling, we are trying to go more high spec rigs that give us the ability to use 7,500 PSI pumping systems that have the more advanced moving systems so we can move across the pad efficiently.","So, all of those things, I think will contribute to little bit more upward pressure commercially on services and goods probably in the second half of the year. And it's our job to continue to work to offset those.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then in Oklahoma, a couple years ago you talked about in a lower price environment, it wasn't as competitive. And you've talked about the improving technology that's made the SCOOP work and extended reach laterals. Can you talk about the STACK and the extension of the southern Mississippi, and of what your seeing there, and how that works in this commodity price environment?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, our early results in the Southern Mississippi trend or the STACK are very, very encouraging as we look at liquid deals and overall performance. We feel very encouraged given that there is remaining consolidation and Greenfield leasing opportunities there, we've been somewhat quiet on sharing specific well results because we still see some competitive advantage to, based on our knowledge base of the play now to continue to go out and grow and consolidate that position.","But we feel today that based on very early results, that Southern Mississippi trend will be in and compete for capital allocation.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","All right, thanks guys.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering & Holt","","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On the Bakken enhanced fracs, looking at the public data shows that in 2013, you averaged 8000 pounds of proppant per stage on 30 stages. Can you talk about what you're seeing -- or what you're testing leading-edge, and where on your acreage you're testing that?","","Lee Tillman","Yeah, absolutely. Well certainly for us, we're looking across all the variables and completion design. Of course in the Bakken, our standard completion has been kind of a notional 29, 30 stage completion with a little under \u00a33 million of proppant. Typically that's been a sliding sleeve, and again that's using our kind of 320 acre kind of spacing model.","I think what you're going to see going forward is that we're going to drop at stage spacing facing, which of course will have the effect of raising our number of stages per well.","I think you'll see us looking to test the variability and frac volume loading, how much volume we're actually plumping. And then as you stated, we'll also look at moving the proppant loading to much higher levels.","In fact, we have trials that will take us up to \u00a36 million per completion. We'll also be looking at different frac designs using both the hybrid fracs which combine slickwater and more conventional proppant as well as straight slickwater as well. And given that we've been primarily sliding sleeve completions.","We're very interested in also testing the cement liner with plug-and-perf. So, we've got a variety of variables. That's why we're going to be so active in the second half of the year is that, we think we because of the quality, because of the materiality of our position, we think we can move a bit more aggressively on both down spacing as well as completion design, and that's really what you're seeing in the second half of the year.","And that will be an \u2013 in really the core areas of our play Jeoffrey, Myrmidon, Hector and Ajax.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering & Holt","Great. Thanks for that detail. Switching to the Eagle Ford. Just going back to the proppant side there of those enhanced completions, can you talk more about your running room that you've got for further testing there, and what you're experimenting with leading edge there, as well? Thanks","Lee Tillman","Yeah, similar, I would say, to Bakken it starts with continuing to drive down spacing. We, largely speaking now are at 40 acre spacing for the bulk of our core acreage that we're developing. But with that, as I mentioned earlier, our standard design now is around 250 foot stage spacing but, we're looking at even taking that lower than the 250 foot, which will have the net affect again of having more stages in our designs.","We're also similar to Bakken looking at higher volume metric loading in terms of frac volumes as well as higher proppant loadings. And so, both of those will be key variables that we're taking a look at.","And we'll even look at some of our chemical additives that we use with the jobs that we pump, the surfactants that we use, et cetera, to see if we can find efficiency there as well.","So, there's still in my view, running room there in the Eagle Ford today. We've essentially offset any potential negative impact from down spacing to 40 acres by continually improving our completion design and delivery and we anticipate that continuing.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering & Holt","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks. Good morning. Question on the upper Eagle Ford. You obviously talked about some successful wells there. Can you give us a sense, when you step back and look at your entire Eagle Ford position, how much do you think could be perspective for it? When you look at the nine wells you are currently drilling, how much the rest of your acreage are you testing right now?","Lee Tillman","Yeah. And just to be absolutely clear, when we talk about upper yield for we tend to talk about the Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford as a unit together. And when we talked in the release about the 15,500 net acres that we've delineated, that really is the combined Austin Chalk\/Upper Eagle Ford.","We're continuing that delineation program Scott. We wanted to get out some of the positive news this quarter because we have de-risk now, that's 15,500 net acres, which we believe will be developed on normally 40\/60 acre spacing going forward.","We want to continue that delineation plan. You talked about the additional wells that we have activity on. And those are just going to continue we hope to add to that 15,500 net acres.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then, just to clarify, when you all give your resource update late in the year, will you have a pretty good sense of your entire acreage position and how much of that has upper Eagle Ford\/Austin Chalk potential?","Lee Tillman","That's absolutely. Our plan is to give more - based on where we are at that point in time, we will connect the dots between the net acreage that we've been able to de-risk and the resource potential and well inventory that that will deliver.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And my follow-up. In the Bakken, on your 12 wells per DSU test, can you remind me, how are you drilling those? Are they going to be six Bakken and six Three Forks? And will those Three Forks be all in that upper bench? Or are you planning on doing any chevron in some of the lower benches on that?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, you're spot on Scott. These will be the six-by-six, with six middle Bakken. Six primarily in the Three Forks first bench. We do have some activity \u2013 we've of course been involved in the other benches of the Three Forks through our joined interest business in Bakken our OBO business. But it is our intent to also test in our operative well, some of the lower benches a bit later in the year as well.","But our primary objective is getting the 12 wells per DSU utilizing the middle Bakken and the first bench of the Three Forks.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Thanks for taking my question. Mostly answered. One on continue, if I may. You mentioned that Sala-1 discovery, given that it's natural gas, what can you guys do with that?","Lee Tillman","Yeah, well certainly Sala-1 is gas discovery. Sala-2 which is already spud in the third quarter. We'll be appraising the size of that development, of that resource.","In terms of development, of course that area of the world needs gas, needs power infrastructure. So there are paths to monetization there for gas.","For us, of course we would prefer to keep the bias toward our liquids waiting. But we do see opportunity here with the Sala-2 appraisal, it will give us a view of the size of the prospect and then we'll start talking about how best to move forward the development.","What I'll stress though is that, the discovery there is, one discovery on blocks that our multi-million acre blocks. So, this is just one part and the fact that this proved a working hydrocarbon system with reservoir quality, I think is notable and important.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay. And then one on Kurdistan, following up on the question of maybe 10 minutes ago. In the context of the fighting, has there been any slowdown in activity, bringing in personnel, and in particular, I'm thinking about the development of the Atrush block, which I know you guys were hoping to bring online next year.","Lee Tillman","At this point Pavel, I would say we have an experience, any material impact on either our drilling operations or on the go-forward development work at Atrush, we continued with the development well at Atrush per plan.","So, today, and again, we're only as good as our last day of operation there. But today we just haven't seen direct impact on our operations.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay. Clear enough. Appreciate it.","Lee Tillman","Thank you, Pavel.","Operator","The next question is from Amir Arif with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks, good morning guys.","Lee Tillman","","Good morning.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Just a quick question for you. When you think of the large proceeds coming in from Norway, how do you think about maybe using some of that to do a large, bolt-on acquisition in one of the existing areas or a new area? And just comparing that against your inventory, especially at a higher activity level, in terms of your comfort level with inventory in your three key resource plays?","Lee Tillman","Well, I would say Amir, we again, our first call is going to be on organic growth. We feel very strongly that our inventory is solid. And as we look at the performance, not only in the second quarter but look at the activity in second half of the year, we anticipate forward positive pressure on our resource size across the resource plays.","So we have very high confidence in our organic opportunities. Having said that, we would never rule-out another use of capital but we're very comfortable with our organic investment.","We also have the option to look at opportunistic share repurchases as well. So, we feel that we've got ample internal opportunities for the deployment of the Norway capital.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. But, in terms of the return potential or opportunities that you see right now, could you just provide some color on acquisition versus organic growth?","Lee Tillman","Again, our immediate view today is that we have the organic opportunities that will compete very favorably for the redeployment of the Norwegian capital. And that really is our case to be.","And in fact that's one of the reasons why we'll be testing very thoroughly as part of our business planning process, our ability to further accelerate in the U.S. resource plays.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the share buybacks. Is the timing of that dependent on the proceeds coming, in or will that -- should we think of you using up pretty much or maintaining the current pace of share buybacks?","Lee Tillman","Well, we don't have a current pace of share buybacks. We have been an opportunistic share repurchaser. That will continue and the timing of that will be a discussion with the leadership team and our board, when that occurs. We have remaining $1.5 billion of repurchase authorization that's outstanding and so we have that flexibility available to us.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Theo Maryanos - Tuohy Brothers","Good morning. This is the Theo Maryanos for Jeffrey Campbell. Can you guys just touch on the mix for liquids in the Oklahoma resource plays?","Lee Tillman","I think we've talked about that certainly on an incremental well basis, as we've quoted, our numbers in the SCOOP XL, we've tried to be very transparent on the liquid content. Our most recent IP is right around 64% liquids. We of course have a bit more exposure there to NGL pricing in Oklahoma.","But as we look again at the incremental well economics in the SCOOP, we find it competing very favorably for capital. And again as we continue to grow and consolidate that position, there's no doubt that Oklahoma is a candidate for moving to a much higher scale in the future.","We're only currently running four rigs in Oklahoma, which are largely dedicated toward ensuring we hold our very high quality SCOOP acreage.","Theo Maryanos - Tuohy Brothers","Great. Appreciate it. And can you touch, how many location -- or potential recompletion locations might you have if the Hector area recompletions are successful?","Lee Tillman","If we're successful, if we move through 2014 successfully, we would anticipate having an inventory of about 60 recompletes going forward based on our current analysis.","Theo Maryanos - Tuohy Brothers","Great. Appreciate it.","Lee Tillman","Thank you very much.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

Last night, we issued a press release and slide presentation that address our fourth quarter results, full year 2017 results and our 2018 capital budget. Those documents as well as our quarterly investor packet can be found in our website at marathonoil.com.","Today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee Tillman, our President and CEO, who will provide a few opening remarks before we begin Q&A.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to begin with some highlights from 2017, followed by some key messages around our 2018 capital program. 2017 was truly a pivotal year in our ongoing transformation to a U.S. resource play-focused independent E&P. We made progress across every element of our playbook: balance sheet, cost structure, portfolio. And we achieved high return growth within cash flows at moderate oil pricing.","Our differentiated position in the four lowest cost, highest margin oil plays demonstrated its strength as we consistently outperformed quarter-after-quarter. Importantly, we balanced our 2017 CapEx and dividend with cash flows, excluding the late December UK tax settlement under appeal, while WTI averaged just above $50. We achieved that cash flow neutrality while delivering on all our 2017 commitments, including near the top end of our total company production guidance, driven by a strong 31% exit rate from our U.S. resource plays.","We ended 2017 with a stronger balance sheet from our $1.75 billion reduction in gross debt, a lower cost structure with $115 million in annualized interest expense savings, a 35% reduction in unit G&A expense over the last three years and the lowest U.S. unit production expense since becoming an independent E&P. We also finished the year with a more concentrated portfolio with the sale of Canadian Oil Sands and entry into the Northern Delaware, and outstanding consistent execution across all four basins as evidenced by peer leading well results.","Our 2018 capital allocation philosophy is fully consistent with how we managed the business in 2017, which is to deliver a returns-focused program that balances cash flow with our CapEx and dividend and do that at a moderate oil price of $50 WTI. We'll direct over 90% to the U.S. resource plays and maximum \u2013 and maximize corporate returns by focusing on high-efficiency development in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, while providing flexibility for the Northern Delaware and Oklahoma to transition to multi-well pads at the appropriate pace, while continuing delineation and appraisal work.","Our 2018 program was informed by the results generated in 2017. Strong performance across the Eagle Ford even as we moved farther west outside core Karnes County, western basin wells in both our Myrmidon and Hector areas of the Bakken; outstanding results from our first STACK of volatile oil infill development and continued learnings from our black oil infill pilot program, and impressive early results in the Northern Delaware.","Internal competition for our development CapEx is broader, more diverse and more intense than it has ever been. You should expect our capital allocation to remain a dynamic, real-time effort as we continually optimize across our four basins, leverage learnings and respond to performance trends as well as the macro environment.","Moving to some specifics for the 2018 capital program, our returns-focused development capital budget of $2.3 billion is self-funding at $50 WTI, including our $170 million dividend and will generate meaningful free cash flow at $60 WTI. We are very oil leveraged and we will generate an incremental $500 million in operating cash flow for a $10 move from $50 to $60 WTI, inclusive of our hedges. We have about 50% of our oil and about 20% of our gas hedged for 2018.","We forecast total 2018 production up 12% at the midpoint compared to 2017 on a divestiture-adjusted basis., while total annual oil production is expected to increase about 18% at the midpoint on the same basis, driven by 20% to 25% annual oil growth in the U.S. resource plays. This growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation. As a reminder, we continue to exclude Libya from all of our production guidance.","Almost 60% of the development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets which have demonstrated step change performance operating at scale. Approximately one-third of the development budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets, where a majority of 2018's drilling activity will transition to multi-well pads, while continuing strategic delineation and appraisal.","At a basin level, I couldn't be more proud of our Eagle Ford team in 2017. They delivered their best year of well productivity, despite navigating Hurricane Harvey. Activity levels in 2018 will be ratable, similar to last year, while we continue our successful high intensity engineered completions in both our core Karnes County wells and Atascosa County, while leveraging the benefits of LLS pricing.","We expect Eagle Ford 2018 annual production to be essentially flat, while generating free cash flow. For the Bakken, we've now delivered 15 of the 25 best Middle Bakken wells in Williston Basin history, seven of which came in the fourth quarter. Our step changing completion design and application of technology paired with world-class rock has proven to be a powerful combination. In 2018, we'll further test our upgraded completion design in other parts of Hector as well as Ajax, while keeping the majority of CapEx directed toward our high confidence Myrmidon area. We expect strong growth in the Bakken, while generating free cash flow at $50.","In Oklahoma, we delivered an impressive nine-well STACK volatile oil infill that is exceeding early expectations with the new wells averaging over 1,800 boe per day IP 30. In the black oil window, we continued our pilot program with our third and eastern most infill and these results have helped inform our pace of activity in 2018 to ensure we determine the most economic development solution for each and every DSU. Oklahoma will deliver self-funded growth this year, including secondary target delineation and a transition to 80% pad drilling, while completing our STACK leasehold requirements by year-end.","And finally, Northern Delaware demonstrated remarkable execution in Q4, with average IP 30s from all 11 wells of over 1,800 boe per day, including a two-well pad averaging almost 3,300 boe per day that was 62% oil. In 2018, we'll focus on the Upper Wolfcamp, the X-Y and 3rd Bone Spring. A portion of the 2018 CapEx will be spent increasing our year-end operational DUC inventory by 65%, as well as testing the Avalon and 1st Bone Spring later in the year.","As a result of this concentrated capital allocation, the U.S. resource plays will increase to about 70% of the total company production mix, driving a natural expansion in margins. Through our portfolio transformation and cost structure reset, we expect to increase 2018 unit EBITDAX margins by 35% relative to 2015 on a price-normalized basis.","Additionally, we expect to deliver a strong annual rate of change on the key corporate performance metrics of cash return on invested capital or CROIC and cash flow per debt adjusted share, both of which have been integrated into our executive compensation structure. We recognize there is no single perfect performance metric to determine the health of an E&P business and we must consider many financial and operating metrics.","However, we believe when viewed together, these two metrics are indicative of the performance of the current development capital program as well as the overall strength of the business. They are transparent and readily determined from publicly available data. At $50 WTI, we see a year-over-year improvement in CROIC of about 30%, while at $60 WTI that increases to over 50%, readily outpacing our production growth. Cash flow per debt adjusted share also enjoys a material year-over-year improvement.","Our development capital program is balanced to live within our means, inclusive of the dividend at $50 WTI and generate meaningful free cash flow at $60. It is certainly refreshing to be having a conversation about free cash flow generation and we have already established a track record of cash flow neutrality in 2017, so this represents the next natural progression of our business model.","Should we continue to see pricing above $50 or execute further divestments, we have multiple options, balance sheet, resource play leasing and exploration, bolt-on acquisitions and direct return of capital to our shareholders. But any action will always be driven by seeking the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.","Expanding a bit on our options, on the balance sheet, we have done some great work in 2017. And as a reminder, we've yet to receive final proceeds of $750 million from the oil sands sale. We will continue to seek opportunities to lower our corporate cost. We have an active resource play exploration team that is pursuing low entry cost organic leasing opportunities that would be accretive to long-term returns. Our business development team continues to assess bolt-on acquisitions in core basins that create synergistic combinations not just simply adding more acreage, and finally enhancing our direct return of capital to our shareholder that builds upon our already competitive dividend of $170 million per year.","In closing, a remarkable and pivotal 2017 has positioned us strongly for 2018's success. We have transitioned from portfolio transformation to execution delivery at scale across our differentiated position in the four lowest cost, highest margin U.S. resource plays. And we met or exceeded our 2017 commitments, while living within our means, including paying our dividend at just above $50 WTI.","We expect our margins to expand as we continue to shift our production mix to a greater weighting of U.S. unconventionals, better aligning our volumes to our investment concentration. This margin expansion story, coupled with outstanding financial flexibility, will help drive corporate level improvements in both cash return and cash flow growth per debt adjusted share and position us favorably to outperform the competition through the end of 2018 and beyond.","I want to conclude by thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors who have made such a difference in 2017, driving execution excellence in every asset every quarter.","Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Lee, I was wondering if you could...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Yeah. I was wondering if you could maybe comment, within the organization, the technical group, et cetera, I wanted to flag slides 13 and 15, where the company really has gone from drilling, dare I say, kind of mediocre results in some of the basins to some of the best results that we're seeing in E&P today. So I just wanted to see if you can maybe comment on internally some of the things that you've done really to drive these improvements in overall results?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, Arun, for the question. I appreciate you recognizing those two teams, because it really has been a remarkable uplift and truly a step change in performance, and were really two of our core developmental areas as we look into 2018. And you know Arun, as you might expect, it's not one thing that's driving that performance, it's a collection of things. And certainly from a technology aspect, I truly believe that what you're seeing here is also a bit of the strength of our four-basin model approach where we're able to learn across basins and apply those learnings very rapidly across all of our major plays. So when we identify a best practice or a technique that's proving dividends in one of our plays, we're very rapidly transferring that into our other basins and that allows us, I believe, to get up that learning curve very, very quickly.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And then just my follow-up is just, I was wondering, Lee, if you could go through kind of your land strategy in the Delaware basin and opportunities to kind of increase your acreage position in the core, expand your opportunities to do longer laterals, et cetera?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Arun. Yeah. Our strategy really in Northern Delaware is less about just gross acreage adds and it's more about finding acreage that fits a very specific criteria and we're going to do that through swaps and trades as well as through some small bolt-ons and we've completed some of all of the above. But really that criteria echoes just what you were addressing, Arun, which is we're looking for those synergistic adds that are going to enhance our overall working interest, that will allow us to convert non-operated to company-operated wells and will provide us more optionality to have longer laterals in the portfolio.","And so we continue to work that hard, it's still very competitive in the Northern Delaware. I mean, you probably will have noted in our material that we were a little cagey even about the location of some of our well results and it's because it remains an active area and our land team and our asset team are out there looking for those kind of hand-in-glove fits that are going to make a difference in our position.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Arun.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Hi, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Good morning. We love the returns targets. Could you just talk about the baselines, this is slide 4 obviously, the baselines from which you're growing the delta, if that makes sense?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, it absolutely makes sense, Paul. We tried to provide in the supplemental data all the pieces needed to do the math. But just to be really clear, we're more focused on the rate of change. But when we look at the absolute metrics in 2017, CROIC is right around the 12% baseline and the cash flow per debt adjusted share is right around $1.90 or a little bit more than that. So that's the baseline that we're coming off of.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","And just let me double check here, so the \u2013 and this is \u2013 and then the improvement obviously is going to be a 2018 over 2017 improvement that you're targeting?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","That's correct. Yeah. What we've tried to do is provide at least line of sight on what that year-over-year kind of rate of change or momentum effect is going to be doing, because we think, again, that it's a bit indicative of multiple things. Obviously, the portfolio moves, but clearly that transition with more of our volumes being sourced from the unconventionals and the impact of the 2018 capital program as well.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Right. And then, given the uncertainty around oil price as always, can you just confirm that you'll be pretty much sticking with the capital program, let's say, regardless of whether oil was to go to $70 a barrel or some sort of upside? And I guess the question ultimately would be whether you want to accelerate more in the Delaware, given that you're essentially pursuing the Bakken and Eagle Ford first, I wondered whether there was a temptation to accelerate to do more if there was more cash available or whether you're happy with the scale of spending and growth? Thanks, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thanks, Paul. Just with respect to your first question about the development capital program, we feel that that program is well-optimized across all four basins; it fits within our overarching criteria to deliver that capital program within cash flows at a high rate of return and do that at a moderate oil pricing. So we don't visualize flex in that development capital program.","In terms of acceleration, we always test how much, how fast can we go. And in many of these basins where we're still just migrating from kind of appraisal, delineation and the early phases of multi well pads, there is an appropriate pace where you can process the data, learn from it and then drive those learnings into your forward decision making. And so there is a balance there between smart acceleration and just accelerating for acceleration sake.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So, but having said that, you're really firm on the CapEx program for this year and so it's going to be a moot point?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Clearly we're going to always be examining the program throughout the year as we get new data, and in my opening comments, Paul, I talked about the fact that we don't view our capital allocation as static, but that allocation is going to be within that framework. Could we redeploy a little bit of capital from one basin to another? Sure, that's absolutely possible. But in terms of the construct and the level of spend, we feel very comfortable with where we are on the $2.3 billion.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Understood, Lee. Thanks very much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gammel from Jefferies.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. Thanks very much, folks. A couple on the Eagle Ford, if I could, please. We're seeing some pretty outstanding results out of not only your Austin Chalk wells, but from others in the industry. I was curious just in terms of that play, how much running room you think you actually have there and then maybe if you could further comment on the remaining drilling inventory that you have in the Eagle Ford as a whole that would be, let's say, less than $50 breakeven price?","And then finally, if I could please, you've talked about bolt-on acquisitions, which you see this is an area where you could potentially be a pretty natural consolidator of properties given that many others in the industry have kind of walked away from the play to a certain extent?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Let me take a couple of those and I may pitch the Austin Chalk question over to Mitch to address and talk about the specifics there. But I think in terms of inventory, Jason, we have talked in the past about kind of at current run rates in terms of wells to sales, we've got about a decade of high quality inventory, right. Now, I know you're referencing a specific kind of breakeven point, but we think that that inventory is a solid inventory to speak from when we address the Eagle Ford.","In terms of bolt-on opportunities, in our core plays, we're always looking for small opportunities that might be accretive to our overall footprint and we certainly evaluate those on an ongoing basis through both the asset team as well as our business development team. So that's always on the table. I mean, a lot of folks have solidified their positions there, we are in a very high quality area of the Eagle Ford, which makes it a little challenging because the folks usually around us are also pretty comfortable with their position as well, but we're always going to keep the aperture open there. So, with that, maybe I'll let Mitch just talk a little bit about the well results and specifically Austin Chalk.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, sure, Jason. This is Mitch. And to address the Austin Chalk specifically, certainly we are encouraged by our most recent test there, more so in the northeastern portion of our position within the Eagle Ford. We will continue to test the Austin Chalk and extend the area of delineation there away from the most recent wells. But our program will largely be focused, like it was last year, on 40 acre Lower Eagle Ford development, extending high intensity completions and engineered flow backs into Atascosa where we're seeing significant uplift in the productivity and the well returns from that program, which is really upgrading and has upgraded the overall competitiveness of the Eagle Ford and driving a fair chunk of that year-over-year improvement that we showed on the slides.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","I'd also maybe just mention too, Jason, as we have stepped more to the west in the Eagle Ford, some of those areas are also much more lightly developed than some of our core areas. And so there's a considerable amount of running room there to elevate those returns into kind of our top tier type of economic returns. So a tremendous amount opportunity and the team is generating some really terrific results out to the west.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yeah, the results have been very impressive. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. When you talk about not envisioning any upward flexing of the capital program, essentially should we assume that to the extent that you're generating free cash flow at $60, you're going to be putting the cash on the balance sheet or are there other uses you anticipate for that?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, again, just to reiterate, we're very comfortable with the capital program irrespective of the ultimate prices that we see in 2018. But in respect that if we do see consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation through the year, which obviously would be north of our breakeven, and certainly in the $60 range we would be, we're going to go through kind of our priority list at that point. And what we're going to be driven by is what is in the highest and best interest of the shareholder. What's going to generate the best long-term value?","We always start with the balance sheet. I give a ton of credit to Dane and the team here for really doing some outstanding work on the balance sheet in 2017 through some very unique features of our capital structure. And so, I would say a lot of \u2013 maybe some of the low hanging fruit there we've captured, that when by doing so, that also brought along with it some pretty significant corporate cost reductions.","We're always going to, though, test our comfort level with the balance sheet first and also seek those opportunities that can continue to drive our corporate cost even lower. Once we get kind of beyond the balance sheet, I think our next view is taking a look at some of those other high return opportunities and the two that really stand out to us and we've talked about it a couple of these already is, is really one, our ability to drive our resource play exploration opportunities where we're looking for low entry cost, potentially very high return and accretive return opportunities in and around current basins as well as even looking at new plays and new basins.","We've already talked about bolt-on opportunities. We mentioned the Eagle Ford, but more specifically the Northern Delaware and then finally we have to reflect on the fact that we're already returning $170 million of dividends directly to the shareholder. But if we meet those other high return opportunities, that's a discussion that we have each and every quarter with our board of directors around are we calibrating that dividend and that direct return to shareholders correctly. So that's going to really be the priorities that we'll work through in that instance where we are seeing that consistent and sustainable free cash flow generation.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And a follow-up about the North Sea, this is obviously by far the smallest part of your portfolio, you have talked about selling it in the past and we are actually seeing pretty decent pickup in M&A activity in both the UK, Norway and even Denmark. So with the kind of appetite in the industry for some of these assets, would you be perhaps looking to revive that asset sale effort?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think that, as you stated, we made an effort to monetize the UK asset when we sold our Norwegian sector asset back in 2014, and we're not able to, in our view, capture value for that asset at that time. A lot of credit to that team that they have continued to drive cost down, improve reliability, lower the abandonment cost and do many things that are continuing to improve the overall economics of that asset.","But however, we would view that as sitting outside of our core assets, which are the four U.S. resource basins plus EG. So having said that, I agree with your assessment that since 2014, we have had new players come into the North Sea that offer potentially different monetization routes, and the business development team will continue to assess that market and look at those opportunities in due course, but there's no doubt that the UK remains outside of our core portfolio.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate it, guys.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Pavel.","Operator","Our next question is from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","The perspective on the Eagle Ford inventory was helpful. How many years do you think you can continue to grow and sustain the Bakken?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, we haven't provided a fulsome update on the Bakken inventory and then, David, a lot of that has to do with the fact that we're just in a high rate of change in the Bakken today with the success obviously that started in the geologically advantaged Myrmidon area that's now carried down into at least the higher quality areas of the Hector, we're pushing south and Hector, this year we'll also do some testing in Ajax. So, given all that rate of change and the fact that we really don't have a tremendous amount of production history on the newly designed completions in the Hector, we really need to get some time there so that we can do, I would say, a more fulsome job of providing a comprehensive update on the Bakken inventory that reflects what is a tremendous amount of new data and new information.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So maybe end of the year start getting sort of that thought process of everything together, but it looks pretty sustainable on our numbers, so looks good.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","On the other side, Oklahoma resource plays, you made a statement that the Eve pilot, you announced five of the six wells and it informs your pace of development and the best economics. What \u2013 can you kind of characterize what informs means and what you think about in the black oil window?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, I'm going to kick that one over to Mitch, who can probably give us a little more color just across the black oil window in general.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, sure. David, let me kind of start from a little bit higher level that I think addresses your question. If you think about the normally pressured black oil area versus the over pressured area of the STACK, there's been much less activity in the normally pressured area. We drilled three pilots over in that area in pretty rapid succession, and really testing the higher end of well spacing. We had between five and six infills plus a parent in the three pads, but effectively tested equivalent spacing between six and nine wells per section in those three.","The results haven't met our expectations thus far and we think with our returns focused capital allocation that suggests it's prudent to moderate our pace there. Let us integrate those learnings and concentrate more of our efforts into the over pressured area in the near term where there's been more industry activity. We've actually progressed into the development mode particularly in the oil window in the over pressured area, and as you mentioned or others have mentioned, certainly very encouraged by the nine-well Tan infill test.","What I would say in terms of informing, this play is certainly not ubiquitous. We're integrating massive amounts of subsurface completion and production data, integrating that with all available tools and technology to get down to essentially a DSU-by-DSU development solution, the right combination of both well spacing and completions.","I think notionally, we would say the Eve was our furthest east most test and between aggregating all of that data, it would suggest on the far east sides, the solution will likely be less than six wells per section, but well count increasing as you move west into the thicker and more pressured areas. And certainly, early data from the Tan at nine wells per section is very encouraging, but we'll need to monitor that longer term.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning, everybody. I had a question about, in the Eagle Ford with the new completion improvement, have you tested anything in the Gonzales area, the Barnhart area?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. We have concentrated a fair bit of our activity in the Karnes area, but as we've disclosed for the last several quarters, we're progressing more and getting more concentrated down into Atascosa. But we also have tests across the entire play and that would include Gonzales and Barnhart. But we disclose every quarter the wells to sales and where our activity is and that's probably the best measure of seeing how we're allocating capital across our position.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. And then some of this completion improvements and the basin modeling that you're doing, can you talk about how close you are to in applying that or are you applying that now in the over pressured area of \u2013 in the STACK?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","I think if I follow the question, Biju, we obviously have an extensive position across the STACK, in all phase windows and all pressure regimes, including both company-operated and operated by others, non-operated positions where we have access to all of the details around completion style.","Over the past 18 months or so, particularly in the volatile oil area, we've tested a pretty extensive range of completion parameters, including varying propane loading from 1,500 pounds to up over 3,000 pounds per foot, different stage spacing, cluster spacing and fluid composition. And so, we do feel like we're narrowing in on the right completion design there, which we employed on the Tan and have had very successful results, previous to the Tan on our parent wells in that area. And so, we feel like we're honing in on the right answer in that \u2013 in the north \u2013 in the over pressured window, yes.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","I'll now turn it back over to Zach Dailey for closing remarks.","Zach Dailey - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, John, and thanks to everybody for joining us today.

In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Please note that in the appendix to this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2011 and 2012, balance sheet and cash flow information, third quarter and full year 2012 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.","Moving to Slide 3. Our second quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $416 million was a 13% decrease from the first quarter of 2012, largely a result of higher income taxes driven by a change in the mix of production, with higher sales volumes in Libya and lower U.S. pretax earnings. This decrease was partially offset by higher international pretax income.","As shown on Slide 4, earnings before tax from the international portion of our E&P segment increased $76 million, driven by higher sales in Libya, while the domestic portion of that segment decreased $62 million, largely a result of higher exploration expenses. Pretax income for the Oil Sands Mining and Integrated Gas segments each increased $13 million over the previous quarter. Again, the change in production and income mix led to higher overall income taxes.","On Slide 5, we've included a comparison of the total Upstream second quarter versus the first quarter liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, excluding Libya. In the appendix to this presentation, you will find a similar slide comparing actual second quarter to projected third quarter sales volumes to help you in modeling the company's third quarter. Again, this slide excludes Libya because of the unpredictability of those volumes.","As shown on Slide 6, the second quarter was a good operating quarter for the E&P segment, with higher sales volumes compared to the first quarter. However, this increase was more than offset by lower prices, higher segment income tax expense and higher absolute cost, although on a BOE basis, costs were relatively flat quarter-to-quarter.","Moving to Slide 7. Our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased while gas volumes decreased, netting to a positive volume variance quarter-to-quarter. Both domestic liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations were lower in the second quarter. On an absolute basis, DD&A was lower owing to our anticipated Alaska disposition.","As shown on Slide 8, total U.S. E&P costs per BOE remained flat with the previous 4 quarters. Excluding exploration expenses, costs per BOE were down $3.80 quarter-over-quarter, with the previously mentioned decrease in DD&A, lower production taxes and reduced field level controllable costs.","Slide 9 graphically demonstrates the Lower 48 onshore production growth we have realized over the past few quarters, with the production from the first to second quarter up almost 7%. Excluding our pending Paloma acquisition, we expect to reach between 120,000 and 130,000 BOED in the fourth quarter 2012, a 60% to 70% increase since the third quarter of 2011. You will also see this growth is weighted to liquids, with the largest increase coming from oil and condensate, followed by an increase in NGL.","Slide 10 shows the positive pretax impact from the previously discussed higher international sales volumes, more than offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon price realizations, higher costs and higher taxes related to the mix issue previously discussed.","Slide 11 compares the international E&P cost structure by category over the past 6 quarters. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, field level controllable cost, DD&A and other costs increased in the second quarter, partially offset by a decrease in exploration expenses.","As shown on Slide 12, quarter-over-quarter, our E&P segment production available for sale was flat while sales volumes increased approximately 6%. Increased production available for sale from the continued ramp-up in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Anadarko Woodford plays plus Libya were offset by decreased volumes in EG, Norway and the Gulf of Mexico as a result of planned turnarounds.","The second quarter was relatively balanced between production available for sale and actual sales volumes compared to a 23,000 BOED underlift in the first quarter. The cumulative underlift at the end of the second quarter was approximately 5.9 million BOE: 2.7 million BOE underlifted in Libya, 2 million BOE in Alaska gas storage and underlift positions of 1 million BOE in Europe and 200,000 BOE in EG.","Slide 13 shows the more than 14% growth in our E&P production available for sale since the beginning of 2010, excluding Libya. Adjusting for the impact of major turnarounds during the first and second quarters of 2012, we would have had production available for sale of approximately 376,000 and 381,000 BOED, respectively.","Slide 14 shows our Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $10 million sequentially. This was a result of lower operating costs and other expenses, mostly offset by lower price realizations. Net synthetic crude sales were essentially flat quarter-to-quarter at 44,000 barrels per day.","Slide 15 shows that the Integrated Gas segment income increased $9 million quarter-over-quarter on lower volumes. While the terms and conditions of our offtake agreement are confidential, the second quarter results are indicative of what investors can expect from this segment on a go-forward basis with similar volumes and Henry Hub natural gas prices.","Slide 16 provides an analysis of cash flows for the second quarter year-to-date. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $2.3 billion, while working capital changes resulted in a $575-million use of cash, primarily due to international tax payments in the second quarter. Cash capital expenditures year-to-date have been $2.2 billion dollars, with proceeds from dispositions totaling $218 million and dividends paid of $240 million. Net debt has increased $430 million year-to-date and the quarter-end cash balance was approximately $450 million.","As shown on Slide 17, at the end of the second quarter 2012, our cash-adjusted debt-to-total-capital ratio was 21%, a slight increase from the first quarter. I'd like to remind you that the appendix has a significant amount of forward-looking data for use in modeling the company's third quarter and full year results.","With that, we'll move to Slide 18, and I'll turn the call over to Clarence for some remarks.","Clarence P. Cazalot","As Howard mentioned, we saw another good performance from our base business, with major turnarounds in Equatorial Guinea and Norway being completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Top quartile reliability and solid operations allowed us to deliver production available for sale at the upper end of our guidance.","We also had strong growth in the second quarter in our 3 key resource plays. Comparing the second quarter to the first quarter, Eagle Ford production was up 50%, Bakken was up 4.7% and the Woodford was up 24%. We're on track to deliver annual 5% growth in production available for sale in 2012 over 2011, excluding Libya. We're also on track to deliver greater than 150% reserve replacement in 2012, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. And we're targeting 6% to 8% growth in annual production available for sale from 2012 to 2013, excluding Libya and Alaska.","In the face of weaker crude and NGL prices, particularly in inland U.S. markets, our focus on profitable growth and our commitment to capital discipline has led us to seek capital reductions without sacrificing growth. For the remainder of 2012 and perhaps into 2013, we're reducing our rig count in the Anadarko Woodford from 6 to 2 rigs, and we're reducing our Bakken rig count from 8 to 5 rigs. We believe we can maintain flat production in both of these areas through 2013 at these rig levels, but obviously, we retain the flexibility to ramp back up if prices and\/or costs improve. We've also suspended drilling in the Niobrara and plan to frac 1 additional well already drilled. We will further evaluate the area from data already collected and from the future production history of the 16 production wells we have in the area.","A real success story is being seen in the Eagle Ford, where we've continued to reduce the time needed to drill wells there. And we're now in a position to drill and complete our target number of wells with 18 rigs rather than ramping up to 20 as planned with the Paloma acquisition.","We are focused on maintaining our growth while living within our cash flows. To that point, I'll tell you our asset divestiture program is on track, and we expect to meet or exceed our $1.5-billion to $3-billion divestiture program by the end of 2013. And you'll note in the press release that we have disclosed the potential purchase price in Alaska as being $375 million, and I would also tell you that interest in the sale of our Neptune gas plant, our 50% interest there, has been quite strong, and we'll be reviewing those bids very shortly.","Turning to exploration. We have enhanced the potential and risk profile of our global exploration portfolio, with new entries into Gabon, Kenya and potentially Ethiopia. And as you've seen yesterday, we farmed down 2 Kurdistan blocks, our two 100% blocks, to balance our portfolio.","Lastly, there's been a great deal of attention obviously and a great deal of focus by investors on our Eagle Ford position, and so I've asked Lance Robertson to provide an update on our operations there.","Lance Robertson","Thanks, Clarence. Going to Slide 19, you'll see a map of the Eagle Ford and our acreage position, along with where we are currently drilling. Also in the slide are indicative well results illustrating continued strong performance across the acreage position.","During the second quarter, we became active in the condensate acreage as we continued to build midstream infrastructure to support this area. Our rig activity is currently 50% discretionary and will continue to be directed toward high-value condensate and high GOR oil areas. We anticipate we will keep 10 to 12 rigs active in the core Karnes County area through year end. Note, we are not active in the Wilson County or dry gas areas.","Turning to Slide 20. During the first few months of 2012, we focused on expanding our capability and growing our development capacity. The second quarter saw us build on this solid base with increased rig and frac activity, along with increasing efficiency. With these efforts, quarter-on-quarter production growth was almost 50% in the second quarter. Net production has increased by more than 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2012, with the majority of the increase in the second quarter. We anticipate similarly strong growth in the second half of 2012 as we continue to refine our operation practices and move into more pad-driven activities.","We have demonstrated material reduction in cycle time, reducing our average spud-to-spud time by almost 50% since taking over operations late last year, now averaging 23 days spud-to-spud over the last 2 months. Driven by this efficiency, we expect to continue full field development with 18 rigs, inclusive of the Paloma acreage. We also anticipate continuing with 4 fracture stimulation fleets to complement the drilling rigs.","Turning to Slide 21. We have supported our production growth through investing in extensive midstream infrastructure. Shown in green are 5 new large central delivery facilities that have been built in 2012. Shown in red are 6 more central facilities now under construction. Additionally, over 210 miles of 4-, 6- and 8-inch pipelines have been installed to interconnect these facilities with markets. Building midstream capacity has allowed us to maintain a strong cycle of spud to first sales of less than 60 days with minimal shut-in or flaring. Midstream investment will continue through 2012 to ensure sufficient access to markets.","Slide 22 updates our expected number of locations and production forecast inclusive of the Paloma acquisition. Paloma adds 100 high-value, low-risk locations to our existing inventory. We now anticipate our Eagle Ford production reaching 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2016 compared to 100,000 barrels previously. Change of control of operations is in progress today in existing Paloma operations, and wells will be assumed with current Marathon personnel. And importantly, no contribution from our downspacing studies has been included in either the well count or production numbers.","To that point and moving to Slide 23, we are evaluating the potential to significantly increase our drill locations and by association production, resource and reserves through validating downspacing with targeted infill pilot projects. 5 density pilot projects are currently producing, 2 are in progress and 3 more remain in 2012. 4 additional pilots targeting vertical lateral placement are currently producing.","We're excited about the progress we've made across the basin to date. We have a dedicated team, and while we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, we're seeing great strides in operational capacity. We're confident in our ability to deliver an average of 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for 2012 and to meet or exceed our projections in coming years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard.","Howard J. Thill","Thanks, Lance. [Operator Instructions] Christine, with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate the additional color, and it's interesting to -- it's great to have Lance on the call. So if I may take advantage of him being here, and I do have a follow-up before you go cutting me off here. So, Lance, the well results -- on the last call, Dave Roberts had suggested a completion rate of 16 to 20 wells. 1,200 barrels a day per week, I think, was the number he gave. And you achieved -- you appear to have achieved that step-up, the average step-up in production in the Eagle Ford despite completing fewer wells. So I'm wondering if you can give us some color, what's happening to the well rates a little bit, maybe some color on what happened to the completions. And if I may, just generally an update because it looks like things are going fairly strong there, if you could give us some guidance. My follow-up is on tax, please.","Lance Robertson","Doug, I'd actually say that I think we have achieved what Dave suggested in the previous call. We are consistently delivering 16 to 20 wells per month to sales for the last 4 months. It does vary up and down, modestly driven sometimes by pad activity. And if we fall a little short of that one month, we typically materially increase the next month. And we've worked concertedly to build a little bit more well inventory so that we can dampen down that oscillation as we move to pad-driven activities more and more for both the opportunity to drive down costs, as well as to improve the well EURs. And regarding the well productivity themselves, I think I would just say that we put out a fair amount of disclosure on that first Eagle Ford slide. And we've gotten really positive well results from the northeast all the way to the southwest of that acreage position. And we're very pleased with those results to date, continue to see some improvements and still have a lot of work ahead to make them even better.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that color. My follow-up is on tax. Obviously, there's a lot being made of the very high tax rates that you guys have right now. My question is really on Norway. A year or 2 ago, you used to give a slide showing what the trajectory was in Norway in terms of production. And if we take the mix change of that decline in Norway along with the increase in the U.S., one would expect a fairly precipitous decline in that tax rate. Can you just give us an update as to when you anticipate the Norway decline to really start to kick in and whether or not -- how you would frame our expectations for the medium-term tax rate, in other words, beyond 2012?","David E. Roberts","Doug, this is Dave. I think the charts that we're using in our updates have not changed in terms of we expect next year to still be a very strong year. We'll have boiler production coming on to offset some of the decline that we'll see. That comes on in late 2014. And then you'll start to see the declines that you mentioned. And so I'll turn -- then turn it to Janet about forecasting tax.","Janet F. Clark","Of course, Doug, we certainly hope that the production in Norway stays as high as possible for as long as possible, because generally it's very good returns for us on an after-tax basis. But you're directionally correct. As the mix of pretax income shifts from high tax jurisdictions, such as Norway, to a lower tax jurisdiction such as the U.S., our overall effective tax rate, excluding Libya, will continue to decline. So [indiscernible] prices and differentials, et cetera, I can't be more quantitative about that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. Just getting some clarity, Janet, the U.S. tax will be 0 cash tax. Is that a fair assumption at this point?","Janet F. Clark","The federal rate is 35%. Currently, we are not in a cash-tax-paying mode given the high level of CapEx here in the U.S.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just maybe also given that we could focus on the Eagle Ford, a question around the condensate window to start off with. Just I think it's the Davila or the Davita [ph] well, if I'm reading this correctly, one of the first wells you've drilled in the condensate window. How did the results compare to the sort of 1,650 30-day IP that you were hoping for in the condensate window was a whole?","Lance Robertson","I'd say the Davila wells are relatively new and are performing very strongly. I think our experience in that area is, like you'd expect with many, that there's diversity. I think we're confident that, that area is going to consistently produce, on average, wells that are about 1,650 BOE a day average for 30 days in that group. And there are others in that area that have delivered that year-to-date. I think we're -- essentially, our acquisition model has been proven accurate at this point.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But it's fair to say the results at the moment from that well, I think, it's a 2000 -- just doing the math in my head, it's a 2,024 IP. So with the decline that you see in the early part of the month, maybe what will change to get up to 1,650?","Lance Robertson","I'm sorry, I'm thinking of the math. I mean, that particular well should be in excess of 2,000 barrels a day equivalent right now and has been. I think more I was saying is that in that broad area, we'll have some wells that are below that 1,650 marker and we have some above. But that group will average 1,650 BOE a day on a full-month basis.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then just switching to the overall corporate CapEx. You've got $2.2 billion as a run rate for the first half, and you're dropping some rigs in the Bakken and the Woodford, which sort of suggests that maybe the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion would require a big step-up somewhere else in the portfolio to keep the CapEx unchanged. So maybe just talk through some of the moving parts around the sort of low run rate of CapEx in the first half.","David E. Roberts","Yes. Ed, I think we're right at 50% actually on a run rate basis. So I wouldn't consider that low at all. And I think what we're saying is we're reiterating what we said that last quarter, that the number is going to be circa $5 billion. We've seen pretty significant pressure from 1 particularly large OBO project in our portfolio and a lot of other OBO pressures in some of the unconventional basins, notably the Woodford and the Bakken, that have pushed some of those numbers up. And then in the Eagle Ford, we are drilling longer laterals and putting bigger completions on the wells. And so we're seeing some cost pressures there. But obviously, we're getting better well results also. So that and the early part of the year, we actually are exceeding our pace expectations in places like the Bakken. And so in order to balance out, that's the reason we're cutting back the rigs in the 2 Northern unconventional basins. And it's a pure efficiency decline in South Texas.","Operator","The next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Keeping on the theme, in the Eagle Ford, maybe a question for Lance. Was there any update or results you can share on your various downspacing pilots? Or how should we expect the release of that? Are you going to aggregate the data into early 2013? Or was there -- I know at one point, there had been discussed plans for an Analyst Meeting in the fall. Any update there, please.","Lance Robertson","Well, I'd say 3 of those infill pilot tests are producing. When we said that 2 are in progress, those are actually being stimulated now this week and next week. And so our results are early. I mean, we have very limited production history from those. I think we would anticipate being in a position to share results more materially in 2013. And I think we've said before, the failure case would be, if it didn't work, we'd know that very soon. I think we're very optimistic based on simulation modeling and work we already had on wells in 80-acre spacing that it's not going to fail and it's going to longer, both pressure and rate data, to validate how well that is working. I think we're really focused on making sure we get those early 2012 and start that data collection process so that we don't delay reaching those decision points any longer than we have to.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And maybe another question. I know you guys have invested a lot in midstream infrastructure assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford, in gathering and treating facilities. I mean, do you see any monetization potential of those assets, given a reasonable tax basis and MLP cost of capital advantage there?","David E. Roberts","No, Evan. We don't see that this time. I think we needed to build out the infrastructure, and we put an increased amount of capital to that to make sure that we have the capabilities to deliver on Upstream business. So we're not contemplating any kind of special vehicles in order to release that value.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Looking at your presentation, Slide 20 shows the Eagle Ford wells production over the last several months, and there's a bit of a lumpiness. Can you explain if you expect that type of lumpiness going forward? Or now that you're kind of closer to development mode, is it going to be kind of closer to that 16, 18 wells kind of per month type of pace?","Lance Robertson","Sure, Scott. I think we do expect some variability in that, month to month. And I think you're referring particularly to June was down from May. And as it turns out, those were actually large pad-driven infill densities, those pilot projects being completed and brought online. And so there were some low there. I think what you'll see in future quarters is that we're materially up in July as account of that, as we brought on those large groups of well, ups in well count, I would say. I think what we expect forward is some variability, but we're going to continue to dampen that by managing inventory appropriately.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I think your guidance is, what is it, like 200, 230 wells this year in the Eagle Ford. Is that still intact here? Or do you think you will be at the higher end now or with better efficiencies?","Lance Robertson","Well, we do believe we're going to be in that range from 241 and 251 wells, inclusive of Paloma. And the primary driver of not moving up to 20 rigs for the balance of 2012 is to avoid going off the high end of that range. We've become so efficient that we're just going to capture all the wells we need and finish that development with 2 fewer rigs than we anticipated some months ago.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Now I understand. Okay. And then as a follow-up, in the Bakken and, I guess, the Woodford, it looks like you're scaling back activity. So is the intent basically to kind of keep those areas flat over the next year or so or until you see some cost pressure relief? Is that sort of your intent at this point?","Lance Robertson","Yes, Scott. I think as we mentioned in the release, and I think Clarence echoed this in his comments, it's our expectation that we'll be able to hit the exit rates we talked about in the release and maintain flat production with the 2 rigs in Oklahoma and the 5 in North Dakota.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then are your contracts coming for turnaround for pressure pumping and rig rate, so you may have some leverage due to that? Or when do those go through?","Lance Robertson","We're being able to release the rigs on the basis of contracts expiring. And so as economics shift in the basins, we would expect our overall pricing power on drilling rigs to be able to lead us to attractive contract rates. And we are seeing continued pressure downward on pressure pumping services, particularly in the 2 Northern basins. And we'll try to reap those benefits as well over time.","Operator","The next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I had a question on the Eagle Ford just on efficiency gains there. But you mentioned spud-to-spud days at 23, down from 25 a couple of months ago and significant improvement from last year. My question is, what opportunity do you see for further improvement there? Or are you operating right now at levels that you're satisfied with? And if you could provide more specifics on any efficiency improvements you're driving in the Bakken and the Woodford, that would be helpful as well.","Lance Robertson","Guy, referring to Eagle Ford, I think we're really happy with how quickly we've been able to reduce those cycle times. We're managing both the drilling as well as the moving of the rig as active as we can to drive that. We do not think that we're leveling out to extent we're not going to continue to improve. We've taken very little pad activity. It's been in small groups. And as we convert our rig fleet to more pad-efficient rigs with integrated moving systems, which we're in the process of, as we speak, then we expect to be able to move to more and more large pads, and we're going to drive that time down further. But I think we hope to be able to talk about that in future quarters.","David E. Roberts","Yes. And just to amplify what's going on in the Bakken, just talking about year-on-year quarters, we've seen almost a 30% decrease in our times. And we've seen that really in 2 areas. We've been consistently good in our spud-to-TD times, although we've taken about 10% there. But we've halved our moving rates, and we've taken about 10% off of our completion rates as well to get to the levels that we're looking at. And in Oklahoma, at this point and with the limited number of wells that we've drilled, it's all been improved drilling performance, taking the well curves down from on the order of 70 days into the 50s. And that's just drilling performance, getting used to the basin and trying to be as competitive as we can.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then my follow-up is just with respect to the role exploration will play in the portfolio strategically and longer-terms. But obviously, you guys have been very active recently in acquiring some new frontier acreage. And we had previously been assuming that you were deemphasizing exploration to a certain extent in favor of your North America onshore development. I think your 2012 exploration budget, for example, is down just under 10% year-on-year. So I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more color there on the strategy and how it may or may not have changed.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Dave, I'll take that. This is Clarence. Our strategy has fundamentally not changed. We've said all along that the third leg of our stool of strong base assets, profitable growth is a strong exploration program. And we would devote 10% or roughly $500 million a year to high-impact exploration. And what we've done this quarter is wholly consistent with that.","Operator","The next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And while we're on exploration, I was just curious, I see there's an increase sequentially from $58 million up to about $115 million. Can you confirm, is that expensing the Kilchurn well in the Gulf?","David E. Roberts","Yes. It is, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. My second one was in the Eagle Ford, really on the transport side. I see you're now up to about 70% of the volumes being transported via pipe. And I'm just trying to understand, if you could maybe give us some color on what the price realizations are looking right now on that piped crude and how that compares to maybe to like the $88-a-barrel realization that you've got for the entire U.S. portfolio.","Lance Robertson","Well, Blake, that's a unique question. We sell to multiple contracts in that because we have a variety of gravity. I would say we've focused very hard the first 2 quarters of '12 on marketing and market access. We sell the majority of our oil today on an LLS-less-$6 kind of contract. We're very happy to have that pricing because you guys were aware those differentials are moving a lot in that regard. So the majority of our oil sales are to that LLS-less-$6, and we have some other contracts as well. And we continue to both take market contracts as we grow our production base in both gas and oil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","So just to confirm, so I guess, it's fair to think that as you're growing those volumes and you're increasing your pipeline takeaway, we should think that the price realizations relative to benchmark should improve.","David E. Roberts","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two quick ones. First, just to -- for the modeling. For Droshky and Ozona, what is the second quarter average? And should we assume that now you're pretty much 0?","David E. Roberts","No, Paul. Let me get to my sheets here real quick while I'm look at it. Second quarter in Droshky -- or in Ozona was just about 2,300 barrels a day. And Droshky, because we did have a turnaround, is right at 5,000. So we're still hanging in at both of them.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The second one that, Dave, you were talking about in the Eagle Ford, I think, in the press release, 75% oil and condensate. Do you have a further split between what's the percent of oil -- frac oil and what is the percent of condensate? And have you seen any indication that the condensate started selling at a discount to the frac oil? And whether you could consider the C5, C4 is NGL or condensate in your classification.","David E. Roberts","So between oil and condensate, it's approximately 70% oil and about 30% condensate. And we're currently experiencing strong price realizations on both the crude and the condensate. There's really no material change in that at this time.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you consider C5, C4, those molecules, is NGL or condensate in your classification?","David E. Roberts","Yes. We do. I'm not sure -- yes, in the NGLs, we do have a very heavy NGL mix. And those price realizations are very strong, all selling to the Mont Belvieu market. However, as you guys have seen, there's been pressure on that basket of pricing over the recent 90 days.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. That's very helpful. I just want to know that the classification that for the C5, the pentane, or that the C6 are those that are being classified as the NGL in your classification or is being classified as a condensate in your classification.","David E. Roberts","The C5s are in the NGLs. C5, C6s and heavier are all in the NGL split, Paul.","Operator","There's time for one last question. Today's final question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Clarence, could you just talk a little bit about the decision to pull back on activity and stay within cash flow or close to cash flow as opposed to -- I assume you had the option to actually accelerate your growth rate by maintaining activity high.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. I think, Paul, again, it's wholly consistent with what we've said around capital discipline and focusing on value rather than volume. And you're spot on. We could continue to maintain higher rig levels and grow the volumes at a faster rate. But in the face, as we've said, of lower commodity prices, both crude and NGL, and continued high costs, we don't see that, that makes a great deal of sense. We'll watch to see if cost and\/or pricing improves, and we've got the ability to ramp back up.","Operator","The next question comes from John Malone from Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","One question on Libya. Why the continued unpredictability? What is it going to take for you to get comfortable with including that in guidance? And the 43,000 net in production in the quarter, is that -- do you think it's potentially still flush production?","David E. Roberts","Well, John, this is Dave. I think the critical issue is we've passed an important marker with the elections. But we did see some disruptions relative to social unrest continuing into July. There is no question that we have not yet returned to our full capacity in terms of our ability to direct production out there in terms of our workover capacity. And importantly, it's still an unsure enough situation, where we have not had any Western expats looking at the actual production centers in terms of being in the deep desert. And so our view is until we actually put all those things together, being able to get actual eyes on, actually understanding what's driving what probably is a large degree of flush production, but also ensuring -- the Libyans are making great progress, but that we do have a stable environment, we don't think it would be prudent to forecast volumes.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So once you have some guys there on the ground looking at the conditions of the wells, that would lead you to be more comfortable making a decision on one or the other.","David E. Roberts","Yes. I think obviously, we're very interested in being able to predict these barrels with certainty. They are important to us. So when we get to that level of comfort, we'll be certainly happy to share that with everybody.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And another question. So what drove the curtailment in the Niobrara? What would it take to start up operations there again? Was it what you saw subsurface? Or is it more a cost issue?","David E. Roberts","I think it's both. I think this is a -- these unconventional plays all share similar characteristics. Because we are drilling horizontal wells and putting very large completions, the well costs are obviously an important factor of the economics. And you have to have an appropriate amount of EUR. And to this particular point, we've not found the right mix of cost and completions versus the type of wells that we're actually able to deliver in the DJ Basin. So we're going to evaluate what it is we have and see if it makes sense for us to either change the way we're looking at that program or do something else altogether.","Operator","The next question comes from Eliot Javanmardi from Capital One.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the Oil Sands Mining pricing realizations that we're seeing. I'm seeing a downward trend over the past 3 quarters. Just would like to know what you see happening there and what kind of pricing you could expect going forward in the second half of the year.","David E. Roberts","Yes. We did see obviously weakness in the first half relative to some of the things that drove Bakken weakness. But frankly, Syncrude has bounced back. Our basket should be really looked at as a Syncrude basket because of what we have in terms of our upgrading capability there. And it's comparing very favorably against the WTI. And our expectation is that, that relationship is going to be maintained.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, last question, sort of a headliner overall-looking questions. How would you respond to some investors who would say you have an attractive multiple from the standpoint that it is lower EBIT to EBITDA compared to some of your peers? And when you're going and looking to get a foothold exploration-wise in some of these international regions, how would you respond to investors who feel that, that international exploration may not pay off in the end based on investors being so favorable towards resource plays in the U.S.? How would you respond to that in regards to Marathon's strategy, going forward, in international exploration?","Clarence P. Cazalot","Well, I would say, first of all, I don't think that the exploration we're conducting is at all hindering or limiting the amount of activity we can pursue in the resource plays that we believe generates profitable growth. What we do believe is that exploration in the areas we're looking, where we see very significant potential, has the potential to create significant value for us. And again, as we've seen and Marathon, indeed, has done in the past, you don't have to develop and produce those discoveries out for the next 30 or 40 years. Making the discovery, commercializing it, demonstrating the value gives you the opportunity to monetize at that point. So we see it really as not conflicting. We see it as complimentary. Ultimately, we are all about value creation, and we think that we create that value by running our base assets in a strong, safe way, generating profitable growth from our resource plays, and then complementing that with impact exploration success. So as we've said -- as I said earlier, allocating about 10% of our budget a year. It fluctuates a little bit. We think exploration makes very good sense and is a key part of our strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Similar actually to the question from the previous caller. As you -- given that you clearly have a pretty high tax rate that you're working to lower, as you look at these new frontier exploration plays, Kenya, Ethiopia, Gabon, how confident are you that the fiscal terms there will facilitate improving your overall tax structure?","Clarence P. Cazalot","Well, again, when it comes to exploration, our threshold decision isn't around tax. It starts really with the subsurface and, do we see the sort of geology and the potential belowground to make big finds? We then couple that, obviously, with all the aboveground risk, the risk of operating in that country and infrastructure requirements, but importantly, the fiscal terms. And so we look at the fiscal terms to make sure that the rewards, if we're successful, certainly offset the risk. And in many cases, as you look at production sharing contracts, the taxes for the most part are paid on your behalf. It's sort of rolled up into the PSC. We have some very high tax regimes in Norway and Libya that are sort of unique relative to new production sharing contracts that we enter into around the world. So the tax rate is not the big determinant there. It's really what we see, again, as our ability to create very significant value for the amount of dollars that we're exposing there. And as I said a moment ago, you don't have to produce this out over 40 years. You've got the opportunity with good success to monetize it upfront and capture the value that way.","Janet F. Clark","And I would just add that we look at all of our investments on an after-tax basis. And so even if there is a high tax rate, if the after-tax rate of return is attractive, then it makes sense to make that investment.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Right.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just quickly, can you share the tax terms for either Kenya or Gabon?","Clarence P. Cazalot","No. Not at this time.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's a follow-on. So I mean, just in follow-on to the previous question. I guess, you're going to continue a balanced approach. And one of the measures of success is going to be not just delivery in the Eagle Ford but also developing other shales in North America. And to that end, you've got this disposal program with quite a big chunk of assets. Is there any way you can give us some guidance as to how much might fall within 2012 and how much might fall into 2013 as you have those discussions at this point?","Clarence P. Cazalot","Ed, I think the only guidance we give is sort of around what we've already talked about. We've said in terms of Alaska that we now described as a $375-million asset sale that is still, as you know, going through necessary governmental approvals. We would expect that to close this year. As I said earlier, we are going to be reviewing shortly the bids on our 50% interest in the Neptune gas plant. And I think we feel strongly that will close this year. Beyond that, I don't want to speculate because we've not really talked about anything else that's on the asset sale list. I'll simply tell you that, again, we're confident in getting to the numbers, the range we've talked about before or potentially exceeding them by the end of next year. So we're pressing it.","Operator","The final question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A real quick one. Dave, on Page 19 of your presentation, you're very kind to provide the 24-hours day rate for some of the wells. Do you have an average 30-day IP for the second quarter?","David E. Roberts","No, Paul. We don't have anything like that, but -- no, we don't have -- we don't think about the business that way. I guess, I think what I would say is, consistent with meetings that I've been in, and Lance has just said this, we're very confident in the type curves that we've seen. And we'll provide updated information as we get it. We don't expect them to change materially. And that's the best thing -- way to think about an average, is the type of wells we're bringing on versus those type curves.","Operator","Gentlemen, that was last question. Please go ahead with any final remarks.","Howard J. Thill","All right, Christine, appreciate it. Thank you, everyone, for their interest in Marathon Oil. We hope to see you soon. If you have follow-up questions, please let Chris or myself know. Thank you, and have a great afternoon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Marathon Oil Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is, Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn it over to Guy Baber, you may begin sir.","Guy Baber","Thank you, Brandon, and thanks to all of you listening in today. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release and slide presentation that addressed our 2019 capital budget as well as our full year 2018 and fourth quarter 2018 results. Those documents as well as our quarterly investor packet can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO; Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations; and Pat Wagner; Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy.","As always, today's call will contain forward-looking statements, subject to risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed, or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release, and presentation materials, as well as the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who will provide his opening remarks before we open the call up for Q&A.","Lee Tillman","Thanks, Guy, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning.","I'd like to take a little time upfront to share some thoughts on both our 2018 full year financial and operating results, as well as our 2019 capital program. We don't believe it's a mystery as to what investors are looking for, it's pretty straightforward. Investors are looking for companies that have the right portfolio of assets, that have the right strategy, putting returns first, generating sustainable free cash flow, and sharing that cash flow with investors, that have a strong balance sheet to weather potential volatility, and that have the capability to execute on their commitments consistently.","We believe we scream well on these criteria, and our differentiated performance in 2018 stands as our proof point. For our company differentiated execution led the way in 2018 and underpins our confidence in 2019 delivery. Capital discipline has been the buzzword in the E&P industry throughout most of 2018, and certainly as we enter 2019.","At Marathon, we have a very clear working definition of capital discipline, and it has been our touchstone as we have successfully transitioned to our differentiated multi-basin U.S. resource play model, it is our framework for success.","It begins by ensuring every dollar spent advances our returns at the enterprise level, while also delivering on a well-defined set of core strategic objectives. It means prioritizing sustainable free cash flow generation at conservative prices over growth for growth sake. We've been very clear that production growth is simply an outcome of our disciplined capital allocation process, and given our commitment to returns and cash flow, we emphasize high-value oil growth to drive both high margins and capital efficiency.","And with sustainable free cash flow, capital discipline for us is also a commitment to return capital back to shareholders, through both our peer competitive dividend and thoughtful share repurchases. Share repurchases will be tested to ensure alignment with our returns first orientation, and must be supported by sustainable free cash flow generation, not asset sale proceeds.","And finally, capital discipline is about differentiated execution that continuously drives improvement in capital efficiency and enhances the economic value of our resource base. For many, our definition of capital discipline remains aspirational. A goal that is always just over the horizon. At Marathon, it is a reality, it is how we run our business, and you need only look at the many proof points from 2018.","We set a $2.3 billion development capital budget at the beginning of 2018 and never wavered, ending the year as one of the very few E&Ps that never increased their capital spending budget. We didn't add activity as oil prices outperformed our plan, we stuck to our conviction when industry discipline broke down, and we successfully managed through an inflationary environment during the first half of the year through harnessing the benefits of our multi-basin portfolio.","Our capital budget is not a suggestion, it is a commitment. We got more for every single dollar of capital that we invested. We significantly outperformed on our key corporate financial metrics, cash return on invested capital, and cash flow per debt adjusted share, we meaningfully beat our initial oil production growth guidance through impressive capital efficiency gains across our portfolio. And, we had great success in organically improving the quality of our inventory base through core extension efforts, especially in the Eagle Ford and Bakken.","And when oil outperformed our $50 WTI planning basis, we prioritized free cash flow generation instead of activity acceleration, and delivered $865 million of post dividend organic free cash flow, translating to an organic free cash flow yield of almost 7%. This three cash flow yield is well above the average for the broader market, let alone our E&P peer group.","And finally, we returned a significant amount of cash back to our shareholders. In addition to our peer competitive $170 million annual dividend, we brought bought back $700 million in stock funded entirely by organic free cash flow. In total, we returned over 25% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders.","And we did all of this, while further strengthening our balance sheet by increasing cash, and cash equivalents by $900 million to end the year with $1.5 billion in the bank, maintaining a net debt to EBITDAX ratio among the lowest in our peer group. Our foundation for delivery has never been stronger.","As we turn our focus to 2019 and beyond, rest assured that our framework for success remains the same. Our two-year outlook provides visibility on the metrics that matter most, it prioritizes returns, free cash flow, and return of capital to shareholders.","Production growth is an outcome and we recognize production alone does not equate to profitability. It all starts with sustainable organic free cash flow in both 2019 and 2020 above $45 WTI. Though $50 WTI remains our planning basis and a commodity price at which we generate meaningful free cash flow continuing to drive our enterprise breakeven point lower is essential in a commodity business.","Our forward outlook continues our multi-year rate of change improvement in our key enterprise performance metrics. Cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share, both of which were added to our executive compensation scorecard last year.","Our focus on the powerful combination of dramatic portfolio transformation and the resulting concentrated allocation of capital to our highest margin assets is driving this rate of change. At $50 flat WTI and $60 flat WTI forward pricing, we will drive a 20% and 30% compound annual growth respectively to our cash return on invested capital over the 2017 to 2020 time-frame.","Comparing 2017 directly to 2019, our underlying CROIC almost doubles on normalized pricing. That is the power of our portfolio transformation and focused capital allocation. Our two-year view will generate sustainable free cash flow and we won't need outsize oil prices to do it. More specifically, we will be organic free cash flow positive above $45 WTI in both 2019 and 2020 with significant leverage to even modest price support.","At $50 flat WTI, we are forecasting cumulative 2019 to 2020 organic free cash flow generation of over $750 million. At $60 flat WTI, our cumulative organic free cash flow generation rises to over $2.2 billion or over 17% of our current market capitalization. Importantly, while our 2019 free cash flow is robust, our outlook only improves into 2020. The takeaways from this two-year view are compelling and highlight the following.","Our discipline, just as we proved in 2018, should oil prices outperform our planning basis, we will prioritize our ability to deliver free cash flow instead of chasing growth, our significant upside leverage to even modest oil price support, our sustainability as free cash flow momentum builds over this forecast period, and our compelling free cash flow yield, relative to not only the E&P sector, but to the broader market as well.","And with the sustainability comes a commitment to continue to prioritize returning capital back to our shareholders, building upon our success on this front in 2018 and to underscore our commitment, we have introduced a new return of capital metric to our executive compensation scorecard, joining last year's additions of cash return and cash flow per debt adjusted share.","Crucially, we will continue to fund incremental shareholder return through organic free cash flow generation, not through unsustainable means. Further, we will remain driven by returns at our current market valuation, the disciplined repurchase of our own stock represents a good use of our capital offering very competitive returns.","Differentiated execution remains at the heart of our framework and ensures that we deliver on our commitments to drive capital efficiency improvements across our multi-basin portfolio and continue to enhance our resource base. And though our extensive portfolio transformation has yielded a high quality and high return resource base that obviates the need for any large-scale M&A, we have a comprehensive multipronged approach to continue to enhance it.","First, we are organically upgrading the returns and productivity of our existing inventory through technical innovation, efficiency and cost reduction. We have had great success on this front in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken in 2018 extending the core of our inventory position, enhancing the productivity and returns of much of our remaining inventory in those plays.","Not only does this elevate the value of these basins, it also has the net effect of extending our inventory life as we need fewer wells to deliver the same output. Thus far, our efforts have primarily been focused on uplifting the quality of our existing inventory. Those efforts will continue, and we expect to drive further quality improvement going forward. However, our teams are equally leveraging our learnings and workflows to increase the quantity of our inventory.","While all of the initiatives we are pursuing will not prove successful and some will take more than one year to prove out, our teams are working hard on organic opportunity set that represents hundreds of potential new gross company operated locations in the Eagle Ford and Bakken alone in addition to opportunities across our full portfolio.","These initiatives include acreage extension tests, the application of enhanced completions in new areas and optimize spacing trials. Second, we continue to improve our resource base through small accretive bolt-ons lease sales and trades around our existing positions. We have had great success on this front in the Northern Delaware where we have successfully increased our gross operated location count by around 20% since play entry.","Third, we continue to progress our resource play leasing and exploration program or REx. The objective of which is to prove up additional resource with a focus on full cycle returns through low entry cost. We acquired approximately 260,000 net acres in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk at less than $850 per acre and are pursuing other opportunities. All more than funded in 2018 by disposition proceeds received earlier in the year.","Transitioning to the specifics of our 2019 program, I would first emphasize that the finer details of our plan are fully consistent with the core strategic objectives I have already outlined. Our $2.6 billion total capital budget is down from 2018 and is comprised of approximately $2.4 billion of development capital and $200 million of resource play leasing and exploration capital. And just to reiterate, our planning basis is $50 WTI, but with organic free cash flow above $45 WTI post dividend.","We anticipate total company oil production growth of 10% this year, powered by 12% oil growth in the U.S. on flat wells to sales. High-value oil growth will exceed BOE growth consistent with our returns first capital allocation framework. Over 95% of our development capital is dedicated to our high margin U.S. resource plays, with about 60% going to the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and the remaining 40% going to Oklahoma and the Northern Delaware, generally consistent with our spending mix last year.","In the Eagle Ford, we will continue to deliver compelling returns, meaningful free cash flow and industry-leading capital efficiency. We grew oil production by 7% in 2018 on fewer gross operated wells to sales. Our wells to sales are set to fall by another 10% in 2019 as we fully leverage the step change and well productivity improvement.","In the Bakken with about 90% of our activity concentrated in Myrmidon and core Hector, we will deliver robust returns, free cash flow and oil growth while building upon the strong momentum we have established around our successful core extension test and recent capital efficiency improvements.","In Oklahoma, we will continue progressing infill development in the over-pressured STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford targeting competitive returns and predictable performance while also progressing secondary target delineation.","In the Northern Delaware, we will strategically pace our investments with a keen focus on bottom-line returns and protecting our leasehold. 2019 activity will be concentrated on the upper Wolfcamp in Malaga along with delineation of our acreage position across the attractive Red Hills area.","Finally REx spend is down materially and reflects a more ratable forward spending profile supporting the progression of both Louisiana Austin Chalk as well as other emerging opportunities, all with a focus on full cycle returns.","As I close out my comments, I would like to thank all of our dedicated employees and contractors who made 2018 a year of such differentiated execution for our company. Our future has never been brighter since becoming an independent E&P and powered by our multi-basin portfolio and financial strength, we will build on our momentum from 2018 to continue executing on our framework for success. Driving corporate returns higher, generating sustainable free cash flow, returning capital back to shareholders and delivering differentiated execution.","Thank you all for listening. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And from JPMorgan we have Arun Jayaram. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Lee, I wanted to ask you about Slide 5 in the deck where you go through the organic free cash flow generation, $750 million at $50 oil for '19 and '20, that obviously is before REx spending, but how should investors think about the potential of Marathon to return some of this excess free cash flow back to shareholders, and again I'm just thinking about the REx spending in terms of how you think about cash return?","Lee Tillman","Yes, absolutely Arun. Well, I think through our track record in 2018, we certainly showed that we could strike a balance between obviously funding the very important work of REx but also returning significant cash flow back to shareholders, I mean, as you look at the 2018 numbers, Arun, we were able to - of the $865 million of organic free cash flow that we generated post dividend, we've returned $700 million of that back in the form of share repurchase.","So our view is that our track record speaks for itself. We want to always keep flexibility in our programs, but we are very committed to prioritizing the return of cash to shareholders. Hence, our strong focus on sustainable free cash flow generation at very conservative oil pricing.","Arun Jayaram","My second question relates to the Bakken where - obviously you've benefited from strong well productivity gains. I wanted to know, Lee, if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on the pretty meaningful reduction in completed well costs and do you think that this level of completed well cost, is this a sustainable number on a go-forward basis, and again this is on slide 13 in your deck?","Lee Tillman","Yes, absolutely. I'll maybe make a few comments and turn over to Mitch to get into specifics, but you know when we initially came out with the highly successful test in the Ajax area, we did not address specifically the completed well costs that those were delivered for and of course as we disclosed our fourth quarter results, we gave not only the productivity from those wells, but also the completed well costs which averaged around $5 million.","And I think it's that powerful combination and I think it reflects the fact that our team in the Bakken is not just working the productivity side of the equation, but is also working the capital reduction side of the equation as well.","And with that, I'll let Mitch talk a little bit about some of the specifics around how they're doing that.","Mitch Little","Sure, Arun. I think what's probably at the core of all of this and what's interesting to think about is, discipline is not only important to our investors but it's very impactful in creating the right behaviors on innovation across the company. And so, when we attack capital efficiency, it's not just from the well productivity side, it's also from the denominator side, which is on cost.","And, we gave some good color throughout across all the basins on improvement in completion efficiency, we're seeing market improvement in drilling efficiency as measured by feet per day, but it goes beyond that into design simplification, partnering with the right contractors who have the same efficiency drive that we do, expanding of our vertical integration and self-sourcing of materials, optimization of the full treatment schedule, I mean, it's almost on every front.","And so, we have a number of wells - we highlighted the four Ajax wells, we have a number of wells that we've delivered for that same CWC. There is some variation by area, we would still characterize our Bakken CWC today between $5 million and $6 million, but we have a number across all areas in the $5 million range and we're continuing to keep that focus on capital efficiency.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Lee, another tremendous quarter, so congratulations. I wonder if I could just follow up on the last question, a quick question, I guess, around the structure of the southern, the Bakken area, Ajax and Hector specifically. Is it a structural reason for those costs being lower? I'm thinking that for rock quality or stimulated rock volume, I'm just kind of curious as to, are you treating those wells any differently because of different porosity and permeability or shallower depths, just trying to understand how you can deliver such tremendous results with such low cost?","Mitch Little","Doug, there are some minor differences across the area and as we've talked about on many quarters in the past, we do have a very detailed and structured workflow that helps us tailor our completions to specific areas. That being said, there's not a lot of variability in what we're actually pumping across from Myrmidon down to Ajax and Hector, there's, I would call it more modest variability. And as I mentioned in response to the previous question, we've delivered CWCs at that well cost in the Myrmidon area as well. So this is just a matter of continuously fine tuning and focusing on all elements of capital efficiency.","So the teams are fully charged up to continue to drive that benefit further, as we put on our slides, we were 24% down in completed well costs 4Q '18 compared to 4Q '17, that's a mix of wells across that entire position. So, there's not a lot of variability, I would call it, really modest variability from north to south across our position.","Lee Tillman","I would also add that a lot of the self-help that Mitch outlined around commercial structures, self-sourcing, that applies across the full position, that's not unique to a given area, so that tends to, if you will lift all boats in terms of capital efficiency.","Doug Leggate","So, just one clarification, real quick, Lee, if you don't mind, Mitch what was the lateral length on these wells on average?","Mitch Little","Average is just under 10,000 feet.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up is just a real quick one, Lee, for you probably as the free cash flow generation of your portfolio is clearly tremendous, I'm just wondering if you could give us some idea where the bias is between international and domestic? And, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee Tillman","Yes, well, I mean right now all - both sides of the portfolio are obviously contributing to that free cash flow performance, Doug, as - obviously as the U.S. basins grow in prominence and we've talked about this quite a bit that the - the percent of our production mix sourced from the U.S. is growing over time. We still have very strong though contribution from our integrated gas asset in EG as well, but the Bakken and the Eagle Ford are very strong free cash flow generators as well. So really multiple assets are contributing to that free cash flow positive performance in the out years.","Operator","From BMO Capital Markets, we have Phillip Jungwirth. Please go ahead.","Phillip Jungwirth","Going back to Slide 5, you guys certainly sent a strong message on free cash flow over the next two years, and sure you don't want to get pinned down on our multi-year guidance, but we are just hoping that you will give a little color around activity assumption underpinning the 2020 free cash flow outlook and is this more maintenance level spend or can you deliver growth rate consistent with 2019 while also generating this amount of free cash?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I mean, again, we don't want to get out into talking specifics in the out year 2020, Phill, but what I would tell you is that the activity levels that you would see out across that time period probably reflect very modest changes in activity. These are not large step change increases in any type of capital allocation out in 2020 to achieve this. Yeah, and in fact, I would just add that the momentum in 2020 is such that we are actually enjoying more capital efficiency in 2020 than we do in 2019.","Phillip Jungwirth","And then, I think, I heard this right in the prepared remarks but there seemed to be a change in messaging around adding locations in the Eagle Ford and Bakken versus just upgrading the quality and I was hoping if you could expand upon some of the initiatives mentioned and then the order of magnitude we should be thinking about in terms of years of inventory for each play?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I'll make a few comments and maybe let Mitch jump in with a few basin specific things, but I think, first you start with just the remarkable success that was demonstrated in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and even though we spent a lot of time talking about quality uplift in improving the economic performance as we extended the core, we all recognize that the net effect of that was to actually increase inventory life.","So it's, you're essentially extending inventory life, but doing it in a very capital-efficient manner. One of the best examples, I could talk about would be the performance that we saw in the Ajax completions relative to the last time that we drilled and completed wells there, we saw a 3X uplift in productivity.","So, one well doing the work of three and so that's the type of multiplier effect that we saw, not only in places like Hector and Ajax but certainly even as we extended the core in Atascosa County and the Eagle Ford. I think it's a subtle shift in thinking, and I think it's a natural step for us to transition into continuing that quality work, but also looking at ways to add physical sticks as well and that's where a lot of the effort in 2019 will be focused is on that.","And as I mentioned in my remarks, we see an opportunity set even just restricting it to Bakken and the Eagle Ford that we're talking of hundreds of potential wells that could be added. And again, not all of those efforts might be successful. Some of those may take multiple years to actually prove, but we still see running room in terms of additional sticks, and Mitch, if you want to add anything about some of the things that we're actually testing there.","Mitch Little","Yes, Phill, I think Lee covered it pretty well. The things that I would add, as we've been on this journey, improving the quality of our inventory, we've also been integrating state of the art tools and workflows, and I think I talked about them on the last call where we're using some advanced seismic processing techniques and coupling that with a true 3D fracture modeling tool that integrates with reservoir simulation, which is to best of our knowledge, only one or two of our peers have that same technical - technology capabilities.","So, we're taking the learnings from all that we've done over the last couple of years, applying it then to optimize spacing tests, alternative development schemes, extending these enhanced completions out into further areas. We've had great success in uplifting the quality across most of Atascosa or all of Atascosa, in Eagle Ford, down into Hector, a good looking test in Ajax as well in the Bakken, but there are other areas further away from the traditional core that we'll continue pushing into.","And as Lee said, we have identified just in those two assets hundreds of locations that we have the potential to add and while I agree with Lee our base expectation isn't necessarily all of them will work. I'm pretty optimistic based on our track record over the last couple of years.","Operator","From Simmons Energy, we have Ryan Todd. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a follow-up on the free cash flow generation and the use of cash questions from earlier, you've been pretty consistent in terms of returning cash to shareholders via the buyback so far. How should we think about that, is it generally the standard going forward or how do you think about the balance between buyback and eventual growth of the dividend?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I mean, I would say today our preferred vehicle remains share repurchase and we believe that that generates a strong return based on the valuation but the pace and timing of that share repurchase is going to be governed by sustainable free cash flow. The same discipline you see in all elements of our business, you should expect to see in the way we approach share repurchases and I think we've demonstrated that quite clearly as we calibrated even last year's share repurchase program very closely to our visibility on sustainable free cash flow.","I think, for us, I think the fact that we have also incorporated that into our executive compensation structure is also quite notable. When we look with the comp committee each year, add executive compensation, we really strive to improve in really two dimensions. The first of those dimensions is aligning executive comp with the strategic intent of the company.","The second of those is aligning executive comp with the shareholder experience. In other words, if the shareholder wins, obviously management should win, and I think in that context, we have continued to move forward. Last year, we incorporated cash returns as well as cash flow per debt adjusted share.","When you look at our stated strategic intent, those two made very good sense and now we're integrating a third and complementary item, which is looking at return of cash, which for us will be a metric that looks at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, relative to the amount of sustainable free cash flow that we're generating. And so we think that's very critically important to incent the correct behaviors within the leadership team to drive our strategic intent.","Ryan Todd","And maybe one follow-up on the - in the Permian, what is, what's driven the 20% increase in operated locations in the Delaware Basin up to this point and if you would, can you update us on your latest thoughts in terms of spacing and full section development?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I maybe take the first one and then let the spacing question flow over to Mitch. We stated all along that we like the scale that we have in the Northern Delaware but we would like to strengthen the contiguous nature of our operated position there and we've been very content with working singles and doubles through small bolt-on acquisitions. The New Mexico resale was another example, we participated there with about a $100 million of capital put to work there and also looking at trades with other operators in the area.","And again, all of those are being done with the mindset of being very surgical, very targeted, with an intent of increasing our working interests, providing more exposure to extended lateral optionality as well as converting non-operated to operated positions. And so, it's not simply adding acreage. It's being very specific and very selective about how and where we add that acreage.","And so, it's a combination really of all three of those factors, Ryan, that have resulted in that 20% uplift since we actually entered the play with the two large acquisitions. Maybe on the second question around spacing, maybe I'll let Mitch chime in on that one.","Mitch Little","Absolutely, I think Lee made a couple of remarks on the focus of the near-term program in the Permian and that's probably a good place to start where about two-thirds of our activity will be targeting the Upper Wolfcamp which has seen the most testing in the area and certainly where we've had the majority of our activities since entry and is moving more toward a development mode and we're typically testing in and around the base-case assumptions that we put out in the releases when we made the acquisitions, testing above that in some cases, but largely in line with the base case that we put out there.","The rest of the program is around the delineation efforts that are important for us across the position to optimize the longer-term development plan there and so we're testing different spacing alternatives there. The one that we highlighted in the materials was this Lower Wolfcamp test, which was a test at eight wells per section.","If you refer back to our base-case in the release, our base-case was three wells per section, our upside case was six and we've tested eight here, we're pretty encouraged by the early time performance, but the focus will remain for the near-term on the upper Wolfcamp and then strategic delineation tests and spacing tests across the position to help us further optimize the long-term development plan.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Brian Singer. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","A couple of follow-ups with regard to some of the earlier questions, the first is on the management compensation metrics on return of capital, can you just talk a little bit more about how that's going to be adjudicated by the Board, specifically, if it is on an absolute basis relative to that free cash flow point you made before or rather it's relative to peers and how operating free cash flow would be a driver relative to free cash flow coming in from asset sales or use of balance sheet?","Lee Tillman","Yes, happy to do so Brian, it's - obviously this element is in the portion of our scorecard that we call strategic objectives. In the case of this specific metric, it is going to be really measured as we look at both the delivery to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and looking at that in the context of the actual organic cash flow that we're generating. The Board recognizes that we need flexibility within that but that will be the measuring stick that they will use to assess how we are achieving against that metric.","Today, we don't really because again of a pricing and other things, we have not set a hard target there and hence one of the reasons it fits in the strategic objectives, because we don't want to lose that flexibility, but I think featuring it there set the expectation that we continue the trend that I think we established very clearly in 2018 and I think the alignment with our strategic intent is pretty clear, but it will not be, it would be measured internally not relative to others.","Brian Singer","And then a couple of small follow-ups with regard to the delineation efforts in the Eagle Ford and in the Northern Delaware. In the Eagle Ford, do you expect this year that you're delineation efforts with net add more resource and\/or inventory relative to what would come down as a result of the drilling this year, and then in the Delaware, what is the timing of clarity that you would expect from the delineation efforts in the Lower Wolfcamp?","Mitch Little","So if I start with your Eagle Ford question, I think it's important to recognize that the potential is hundreds of locations, we have dedicated funds and are advancing trials of those different concepts that I talked about, we will be implementing or executing on those this year.","In most cases, we will want to see longer-term performance and we will want to see multiple trials to confirm the full magnitude of the change. So it's hard to put a fixed time scale on that, but I think our teams recognize hundreds of locations across those two most mature assets, we will continue to focus on maintaining longevity in those assets and enhancing longevity where we can.","On the Permian, as you're well aware, this is the most dense resource basin in the U.S. with multiple benches up to 10 or 11 benches in some areas and each of those intervals is going to advance at a slightly different scale I would say. So, again, it would be a different point in time for different intervals within that.","Our focus remains on the upper Wolfcamp, we're about two-thirds of the program, but we'll be getting meaningful tests across multiple secondary objectives this year and then integrate that in and be able to reflect on how prominent that's going to fit into the 2020 and beyond program.","Operator","From Heikkinen Energy, we have David Heikkinen. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen","Thanks for taking the question and the clarity on your Board process. One question, I had though was what factors did you review and actually not add over the last couple of years, or how did you decide on these factors?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think, David, we explore with the compensation committee every year looking at various metrics across our quantitative and strategic scorecard. We believe that in our business that multiple financial metrics are required to really determine the health of the business. So when you look at our scorecard today, not only are you going to find cash return, cash flow per debt adjusted share, and now return of cash, but you're also going to find F&D cost, you're going to find unit margin, you're also going to find unit cash costs.","So when you look collectively at our scorecard we have, almost 70% of our scorecard is embedded in financial metrics. The metrics that we think align best with our strategic intent. There are numerous financial metrics that we've considered. There is of course a bunch of different ways to slice and dice cash return. We've looked at a lot of those.","We landed on this one as one that we felt was something that could be calculated externally with ease and compared and so we look at all those factors when we select the metrics, because we're trying not only to reflect the strategic intent of the business, but provide metrics that are transparent externally as well and meaningful external as well.","David Heikkinen","Just one perspective going to the North American prospect expo, the deal market with us describe as a clogged drain and definitely seems to be a buyer's market. Are returns for acquisitions getting any closer to the returns that you see for buybacks or for probably won't appreciate development economics, but how do you think about the market and kind of the weakness in it on the buyer side?","Lee Tillman","Yes, well, we are always, as we look at our core areas where our teams are generating such high levels of differentiated execution and capital efficiency to the extent that there are small bolt-on opportunities there that offer high quality inventory, not necessarily PDP production. We are always going to take a look at those. In terms of the returns those can generate for high quality assets, those are generally not your distressed assets, and typically there has to be at least some synergy or incremental value that you bring to bear to make those competitive within the overall portfolio.","We're not looking to invest in inventory necessarily that's 10 or 15 years out in time. It needs to be competitive today with the current portfolio and that's a very high bar and I think if we have one struggle, it's just that we do have a very high quality, high return inventory basin, so it takes a very unique and high quality bolt-on to really compete for capital, and you know, but again with our financial flexibility, with our demonstrated performance in these basins if we see those opportunities that fit within our existing footprints, we're going to take a hard look at that.","David Heikkinen","Is the characterization of a clogged drain or a buyer's market, how you see things as well, just curious?","Lee Tillman","I think that anytime you see significant pricing volatility and certainly volatility within a relatively low range, I think that creates some disconnect between buyers and sellers. I think that's just a natural thing that occurs. So, yeah, I would assume that probably some deals are not moving forward because of that.","Operator","From Citi, we have Bob Morris. Please go ahead.","Bob Morris","Just on a little bit on the Permian inventory and how you look to expand there? Obviously, you mentioned you've increased your gross operated inventory by 20% since entering the Permian, but given your prior comments, at this stage, how do you view the opportunity to continue to add to that inventory by all the means that you previously described, is there another 20% increase potential there in the inventory or you would be pretty much exhausted all the easy things or low-hanging fruit in expanding that inventory in the Permian?","Lee Tillman","Well, I don't think we would call any of them easy particularly when you talk about trades and things like that. I think those are tough because you would have to have two parties come to kind of a value proposition and that's always tough.","I think there is still a tremendous amount of running room left in places like Northern Delaware as operators continue to find win-win situations where they can swap out acreage to the benefit of both, I think that's, now, is it going to happen in very large chunks, probably not, it's going to be, again the singles and the doubles, but if your consistent with that and you work that over time, just as we've shown, you can making meaningful impact on your inventory.","So without quantifying it, I absolutely feel that there is more running room there whether it be greenfield lease sales either state or federal from the small acquisition standpoint and certainly on the trade standpoint, I think all three of those are still fully in play.","Bob Morris","And then my second question, Mitch, just looking at the 3R SCOOP Woodford infill that you disclosed here this quarter, you had a pretty good rate on those eight wells. Are all eight wells targeting a single zone in the Woodford, and as a result you had a prior well there, so there were seven infill, did you see any parent child impact or degradation on those infill wells which you drilled there?","Mitch Little","We do have a pretty uniform landing zone in that area, and so, in answering your first question, they're lined up pretty consistently in the vertical plane. It's awful early days there to look at any parent-child impacts.","What I would say is, we're very pleased with the results, both in terms of the returns that they're generating and in terms of the predictability that you see as we plotted against our most recent Woodford infill down in SCOOP and so we'll need a little bit more time to answer the second question, but certainly impressed with what we're seeing, and as you can tell kind of still in the late stages of clean up on those wells also. So, we'll come back to you on that a little bit later.","Bob Morris","Those are good results. I'm just wondering how much of that acreage down there in Woodford might be amenable to eight wells per section and how you view that in your inventory?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think the way I would kind of summarize is, Bob, is that we are very encouraged by the performance and the predictability that we're generating in the SCOOP Woodford whether you look at the Lightner pad that we previously talked about which was a four-well but an eight-well per section equivalent as well. I think that's what we really challenged that team with, with ensuring that we are generating competitive returns and also creating a predictable platform down in the SCOOP Woodford that really to us feels more like development drilling than certainly delineation drilling.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Jeanine Wai. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Following up on Doug's earlier question on free cash flow by asset in terms of advancing the U.S. resource plays from appraisal to development, you have that nice Slide 8 and it looks like the Delaware and Oklahoma, they aren't free cash flow generative yet this year, like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. Just wondering if I have that right and if I do have that right, when do you anticipate that these two assets will turn the corner in free cash flow or what oil price do you think they would be at least cash flow neutral this year?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think is, one of the beauties, I think of the multi-basin model, Jeanine, is that we do have assets that span the full development cycle and that allows us as we do our multi-basin optimization to flex those assets as we need between growth and free cash flow generation or some combination of both. There is little doubt that Bakken and Eagle Ford across the range of pricing sensitivity that we've addressed in this pack, our free cash flow positive in generating very strong free cash flow.","Oklahoma, though we still show that as an early development asset as we, as you kind of hear the conversation today, there is little doubt that SCOOP Woodford and over pressured STACK Meramec are starting to move more toward the green area of this chart. And to the extent that that becomes more of the preponderance of the well mix there, then Oklahoma will clearly start moving toward being at a minimum self-funding and then ultimately cash flow generation as well.","Northern Delaware is a little bit further removed from that. I mean, we're still in the very early days there, we're really in preparatory mode, we're still - that's the only basin where we still have some leasehold obligations yet to complete. The team is definitely on the right trajectory, you're going to see very strong growth there, but on a relatively small base and it's going to be a question of letting the economies of scale catch up there in the Permian, and we plan to get it to free cash flow positive as soon as we can.","But again, I would just stress that for us it's looking collectively across the portfolio, because this is the advantage of the multi-basin model. We can achieve what we need to achieve strategically in a place like Northern Delaware while also relying on our strong capital efficient assets like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford to deliver that free cash flow, which then puts us in a position to be talking about break even enterprise numbers of down around $45 a barrel.","Jeanine Wai","I guess just sticking to that same slide but switching to growth - oil growth. We noticed that two out of your four U.S. resource plays are growing oil and we suspect that the Eagle Ford has the potential to outperform and will probably grow oil this year given how good results are. So essentially three out of four of your U.S. resource plays are growing, the exception is Oklahoma, which you just talked about, you're spending about 20% of your CapEx there and I think you probably just answered this question but can you just talk about longer term, maybe how you're thinking about Oklahoma in your portfolio, you're spending money there, in an area that's not growing, at least now growing now because you said, it's an early development, is not free cash positive and you definitely have other opportunities in your portfolio and whereas before if anybody thought that you didn't have enough inventory and that's why you needed this fourth area, now you're talking about having hundreds of extra locations in your other assets. So just wondering kind of maybe longer, medium term, how you're thinking about it?","Lee Tillman","Yes, I think that as we look at capital allocation, all four of our basins are competing strongly on an economic return basis. So, I mean, when you start at the top of the house with an objective of driving enterprise returns, your whole portfolio has to be contributing to that and we feel that Oklahoma is in a unique position in the sense that it's such a large and diverse acreage position, we're going to have elements of Oklahoma moving into that full-field development mode like SCOOP Woodford, like over pressured STACK Meramec, a bit ahead of some of the secondary zones and we're fine with that.","But there is no doubt in our mind that we have a strong inventory that if needed within our multi-basin model, Oklahoma can be part of that growth equation. It's just as we optimize today, we're not having to pull upon Oklahoma in that manner.","Operator","From SunTrust, we have Neal Dingmann. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Lee could you or Mitch speak to the upcoming drilling cadence potentially you see here this year and going into the next for the Delaware position and again why I'm asking that as you sort of bolt-on obviously the southern acreage maybe being a bit more prolific. I'm just curious how your sort of near-term plans to incorporate through this year through that deposition? Thank you.","Lee Tillman","Sure, Neal. We talked about the intentional focus of our Northern Delaware program being strategically pacing development while accomplishing some of our delineation objectives. And so, we would expect pretty ratable and pretty flat activity across the Northern Delaware throughout 2019 and at a level that's more or less on par with 2018.","Neal Dingmann","And then one follow-up if I could. Just you guys and that the SCOOP\/STACK especially down, looking at your SCOOP program, you continue to have just excellent after excellent well particularly not just on the rate that you are, could you maybe speak to your GOR expectations particular down in the SCOOP, are they sort of on point of now what you're expecting down there. I mean, they certainly appear to be better than what some others have done, maybe have been showing, so any comments you could have down there on your SCOOP program? Thanks so much.","Mitch Little","Yes, I Neal, I think I would just say broadly, with all of these plays, there is some sort of compositional gradient across the structure and so, as we move around the Woodford, we will see some variability, but we've seen pretty good consistency localized with the results that we published recently. But there will certainly be some variability over time or over the geography and geology there.","Lee Tillman","I think importantly though for us, Neal, is that we want to be predictable on that variability. I mean we want to know as we go into these pads the deliverability, what they're going to look like, what the spacing needs to be, et cetera, and that's why we are certainly focusing the '19 program into areas like the SCOOP Woodford and over-pressured STACK Meramec, because we feel that the team now has a workflow to deliver not only great results and great returns but do them in a predictable fashion.","I mean, we may see different spacing, we may see different completion designs, we may see some variability in GOR, but we're seeing that, knowing that going into the development.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we have Nitin Kumar. Please go ahead.","Nitin Kumar","Just in terms of Slide 5, one variable I wanted to understand was what are the service costs inflation assumptions you're baking in and what are you seeing on the spot market right now?","Lee Tillman","Yes, just in general, you know on service costs, particularly as we look ahead to this year. I'd say in aggregate, as we look across all service lines, we are flat to a little bit of deflation in 2019. That's kind of where we stand and that's pretty consistent with the trends that we saw at the end of last year and certainly what we're seeing at the beginning of this year. Particularly as you think about more or less an inflationary assumption that matches up with that $50 flat view, that's going to be a relatively flat kind of assumption on inflation as well that complements that.","Nitin Kumar","And what about the $60 case, is there any inflation baked into 2.2 or -?","Lee Tillman","Yes, well, certainly as you know, the dependency there is really one or more of activity levels not only for us, but across the industry. And certainly as we move more into a $60 world, we would expect an uptick in demand for services, et cetera. We still believe that we have self-help activities that will, generally speaking, help us offset that. So I think within this $50 to $60 band, we feel pretty comfortable that we understand that inflation is going to be at relatively low levels and that in the case of the $60 maybe net of some self-help activities that we have to implement ourselves.","Nitin Kumar","And the other question I had - just had, I think you guys have done a great job of bringing some of the initiatives to organically add resource. But a company of the size of Marathon, your CapEx is still focused on what I would term your legacy assets between the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and kudos to your team of how much better you have made those assets. What is a reasonable inventory life that you look for across the portfolio? What are your expectations? Just to keep this kind of program and these kind of returns, how long do you think you should have?","Lee Tillman","Yes, inventory is something that we think about and work on each and every day. We'll never be satisfied on that front from a quality as well as a quantity standpoint. Just though on your first question, I think, a 60, 40 split between more mature assets and our developing assets to us makes perfect sense, it is very consistent with last year. If you again - you're going to be guided by enterprise returns and organic free cash flow generation, you have to be able to strike the right balance between that mix of assets and we feel very good.","We're still progressing our less mature assets, we're still delineating them. In many cases, we're still growing them in the case of Northern Delaware. You know, when we think about inventory life, we feel very good that the work that we've done in both Bakken and Eagle Ford continue to push that inventory life forward in time, with just the work that we've done last year combined we'd say we've got you know about a decade of inventory across both Bakken and Eagle Ford combined at kind of 2019 consumption rates.","And obviously in the other two assets, we've got multiple decades of inventory there at current consumption rates. So we feel very good about the work that we're doing, not only to develop our inventory, but to continue to replace that inventory in very structured and methodical sort of way.","Operator","From Tuohy Brothers, we have Jeffrey Campbell. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","First of all, congratulations on the quarter and thanks for getting me in. Lee, it looks like international is shifting into what I would call a managed decline and I understand that it's a free cash generating asset. But I was just wondering what metric or metrics do you monitor to decide if and when international might be more valuable to someone else than Marathon?","Lee Tillman","Yes, and I guess on that point, Jeff, I would say, first of all, all international is not created equal. I think we've been very explicit in talking about the foundational elements of our portfolio, our four U.S. resource plays and EG. And if I just focus on EG for a moment, it is a long life, low decline asset with essentially no capital requirements going forward, so it's a free cash flow generator for us. It is, really there's two value propositions in EG, there is the Alba field itself and then there is the value of that infrastructure sitting in a very advantage position in West Africa, an LNG plant, a methanol plant, as well as a gas plant, storage and of course an offloading berth.","Our view is that that is going to be a natural aggregation point of gas going forward. So we still see a very strong value proposition that exists in EG despite the fact that we are in that kind of, 8% to 10% kind of decline from an Alba Field perspective. We think there again, there is really two embedded value propositions there.","One, our equity barrels that we can generate from Alba and the other is taking advantage of this world-class infrastructure that we have on the ground there.","Jeffrey Campbell","And the other question I wanted to ask was just, what's the goal for the Eagle Ford, EOR program that you're testing, I was wondering could this become a meaningful tool in the overall management of the Eagle Ford decline rate at some point or is there some other goal in mind?","Mitch Little","I am happy to provide a little bit of extra color there, Jeff. You know, we in the past had done a single well trial and then a four-well trial where we're looking at the incremental uplift from that. This next phase of the project, which we're implementing this year is a multi-pad deployment of the same techniques and technology. It will provide us on the clarity over the scale that we need to understand what the degree of uplift is.","There is certainly large potential in terms of incremental recovery, simulation studies that we've done and that others have done show an uplift in excess of 30% to the EUR and so this will be the proof point for us on that throughout 2019 and in to 2020 and then we'll be able to see where to take the program from there. But this is a program at scale across four pads, like I said.","Lee Tillman","Yes, Jeff, if I could maybe just add to it, I think that we have high confidence in the physics of enhanced recovery via miscible flooding in unconventional reservoirs. Really it's now sorting out really the economics and scale of that and then assessing how that competes capital allocation within the portfolio. But when you look at the oil in place that we're leaving behind in these reservoirs to think that we're not going to chase that with innovation and technology, I think just doesn't make sense to us.","So it's that next phase for a lot of these, a bit more mature areas is really how do we leverage some of those same techniques that have proven successful in more conventional reservoirs to get our recovery factors up much higher, I mean just a few percentage point movements in recovery factor across these large fields is a difference maker.","Guy Baber","Thank you. And we'll now turn it back to Lee Tillman for closing remarks.","Lee Tillman","I want to thank everyone for your interest in Marathon Oil and we look forward to delivering on our commitments for our shareholders again in 2019. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"13761":["Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  6, 2012  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Howard J.

And as you see on Slide 3, our third quarter 2012 adjusted net income increased 9% from the second quarter of 2012. As shown on Slide 4, the third quarter saw improvements across all 3 segments.","And as shown on Slide 5, this earnings improvement was largely driven by an increase in liquid hydrocarbon sales of 26,000 barrels per day in the third quarter over the second quarter, both excluding Libya. The U.S., Canada, E.G. and Norway sales volumes were higher in the third quarter, largely as a result of growth in the U.S. resource plays and the resumption of production after second quarter turnarounds internationally, offset by lower U.K. sales volumes as a result of planned turnarounds.","In the Appendix of this presentation, you will find a similar slide comparing actual third quarter to estimated fourth quarter sales volumes to help you model the company's fourth quarter.","As shown on Slide 6, the third quarter was another outstanding operating quarter for that E&P segment as reflected by a 17% increase in segment income. This increase was primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A associated with those additional volumes.","Moving to Slide 7. Our U.S. E&P earnings increased 57% in the third quarter versus the second quarter, largely a result of the performance of our resource plays driving higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A associated with the increased volume.","As shown on Slide 8, total U.S. E&P cost per boe declined quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily as a result of lower exploration expenses and operating costs. Excluding the exploration expenses, cost per boe in the U.S. were down $0.34 quarter-over-quarter.","Slide 9 graphically demonstrates the lower 48 onshore production growth we have realized over the past several quarters with the production increase from second to third quarter of approximately 25%. We now expect to reach between 145,000 and 160,000 boed in the fourth quarter 2012, 25,000 to 30,000 boed higher than we previously estimated. This increase is the result of both better operational performance, particularly in the resource plays, and the previously announced Eagle Ford bolt-on acquisitions. From the third quarter 2011 through the fourth quarter of this year, we expect an increase of over 93%. Importantly, oil volumes are expected to increase to 61% and NGLs to 11% of these production volumes.","Slide 10 shows the impact on international E&P earnings from the higher international liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes, lower DD&A and other, plus higher price realizations. The third quarter saw a continued solid performance from our international assets and the execution of a gas sales agreement in Libya, which resulted in additional international gas sales volumes of approximately 23 MMcfd.","Slide 11 shows the international E&P cost structure per boe by category over the past 7 quarters. Compared to the second quarter of 2012, DD&A and other costs decreased in the third quarter partially offset by an increase in field level controllable cost and exploration expenses.","As shown on Slide 12, quarter-over-quarter, our E&P segment production available for sale was 16% higher while sales volumes increased approximately 12%. Increased production available for sale from the continued ramp-up in our U.S. resource plays and the previously mentioned sales agreement in Libya were partially offset by decreased volumes in the U.K. as a result of planned turnarounds.","Excluding the impact of the Libya gas sales agreement, there was a 1.2 million boe overlift in the third quarter, which means the cumulative underlift at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.6 million boe, approximately 2 million boe underlift in Libya, 1.9 million boe in Alaska gas storage and an underlift position of 700,000 boe in Europe, along with an overlift of approximately 100,000 boe in E.G. The Libya gas sales agreement created an additional 2.6 million boe underlift, bringing the total underlift at the end of the third quarter to 7.2 million boe.","Slide 13 shows the approximately 24% growth in our E&P production available for sale, excluding Libya, since the beginning of 2010.","Slide 14 shows our Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $14 million sequentially. This was as a result of higher synthetic crude oil sales volumes and better price realizations, partially offset by higher DD&A, operating costs and other items. Net synthetic crude oil sales increased 20% from 44,000 barrels per day in the second quarter to 53,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.","On Slide 15, Integrated Gas segment income increased $26 million quarter-over-quarter to $39 million in the third quarter, primarily a result of higher LNG sales volumes and lower costs in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, which included turnaround costs. Lower methanol sales partially offset the higher LNG income.","Slide 16 provides an analysis of year-to-date cash flows. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $3.3 billion while working capital changes resulted in a $496 million use of cash. Cash, capital expenditures, year-to-date, have been $3.5 billion with proceeds from dispositions totaling $193 million while we had $806 million of outlays on acquisitions and paid dividends of $360 million. Net debt has increased $1.7 billion year-to-date and the quarter-end cash balance was $671 million.","As shown on Slide 17, at the end of the third quarter 2012, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 25%. The corporate effective tax rate during the third quarter, excluding Libya, was 65%.","Slide 18 summarizes derivative positions we entered into during the third quarter, which relate to a portion of our forecast E&P crude oil sales. The terms of these positions are from October 2012 through December 2013. In unrealized pretax gain of $45 million, $29 million after tax was recognized on these derivatives in the third quarter and excluded from segment income.","I'd like to remind you that the Appendix has a significant amount of forward-looking data for use in modeling the company's fourth quarter and full year results.","We'll now move to Slide 19, and I'll turn the call over to Clarence and Dave for some additional remarks.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Thank you, Howard. As you've just seen, we had an outstanding third quarter, both operationally and financially. And importantly, we have a great deal of momentum to continue performing at a high level. In just a moment, Dave Roberts is going to provide some detail on our key resource plays and enhanced exploration program that will clearly illustrate why we're excited about Marathon's future.","But I want to first summarize the key messages I hope you'll take away from today's presentation. Very importantly, I would expect that Marathon's ability to execute on our resource plays, in terms of pace, performance and bottom line results, has been clearly demonstrated, and we will continue to target increasingly higher levels of performance versus our peers.","We built strong operated positions in 3 of the highest value resource plays in the world. And as Dave will show you, we have a much larger resource base and drilling inventory than was previously communicated. With such a deep high-quality inventory, we will scale our growth to optimize value based on the commodity price and cost environment we see. We built an exploration portfolio with significant resource potential at lower risk in what we believe to be some of the most prospective basins in the world.","And lastly, while much about Marathon has changed, what hasn't is our commitment to financial discipline, a strong balance sheet and creating and delivering value for our shareholders.","Let me now turn it to Dave for the proof points behind these key messages.","David E. Roberts","Thanks, Clarence. I just want to use Slide 20 to highlight the first of Clarence's point, our building credibility and our ability to execute in U.S. resource play.","We have outstanding acreage positions in each of our 3 key plays and are delivering on our promises, currently producing approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net, in the Eagle Ford and raising our target next year by more than 20% to 85,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Bakken, we're producing over 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and raising next year's targets to over 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with only 5 rigs in our program. And at quarter's end, we were producing just over 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Anadarko Woodford with the expectation that we can maintain this rate in the medium term with the 2 rigs we feature in this program.","Turning to Slide 21. Given the demonstrated growth performance we are seeing in our domestic unconventional businesses and the continued strong performance of our base assets, we have increased our 2012 production targets and are affirming a 6% to 8% growth rate for 2013. We are now confident that our previously promised 5% to 7% growth rate can extend to at least 2017. Our production and growth will continue to be liquids weighted while we retain further upside to U.S. natural gas price recovery in the future.","Turning to Slide 22. Howard has already discussed the dramatic production increases experienced in our lower 48 onshore business with growth rates expected of over 90% from last year's light quarter through year-end 2012. Nowhere is this powerful growth story better illustrated than in our Eagle Ford business. Many questioned our ability to meet the operational challenges of the Eagle Ford, but our business has hit its stride, running 18 drilling rigs and 4 full-time frac crews and 2 more on a spot basis with fully competitive cycle time metrics, allowing us to triple the number of well completions per quarter from Q1 and to have dramatically increased production in each of the last 2 quarters.","While we believe we've taken great strides in answering the key proof point around operational excellence for our U.S. resource business, I'd like to move to Slide 23 and the proof point to another key question, was the Eagle Ford acreage as prospective as we thought when we entered the core of the play almost a year ago? These graphs offer some insights into our view that we are, indeed, in some of the best real estate in North America, if not the world today.","We are providing our detailed well performance versus tight curves, along with tabular data updating our expectations for wells in each play type for the 2-phase regimes we are primarily targeting in our Eagle Ford programs. In short, our wells are performing as expected. And with downspacing anticipated, this is a field that will continue to grow and, I believe, outperform for our company.","And on Slide 24, we highlight our best well test to date in the play. As you know, we generally tend to be conservative with our flow back procedures and normally turn wells to sales on 14\/64 to 16\/64 inch choke sizes after test rates at lower chokes. We follow this procedure to avoid damaging our completions and to address any concerns with stress-dependent permeability degradation.","In the case of the Burrow 2-H well highlighted here, we were confident an aggressive test would not cause any long-term recovery issues, and we wanted to demonstrate the quality of our assets in a headline fashion. With what some might call a monster well, the Burrow 2-H tested for 24 hours on an approximately \u00bd inch choke at 6,275 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an oil condensate rate of over 4,600 barrels per day and an NGL rate of almost 800 barrels per day. This is 100% Marathon working interest well, and we expect to test at least 4 other wells on larger than normal choke sizes in Q4 with oil rates expected in the 2,000 to 4,000 barrel per day range. I will say, however, that our practice will continue to be to get stabilized tests at moderate choke ranges with a focus on ultimate recovery as our guide.","Slide 25 addresses perhaps the most exciting opportunity in our entire unconventional resource base, increased well density to increase overall resource capture. Even with state-of-the-art completion activities, most unconventional reservoirs offer ultimate recoveries of less than 10% of oil in place, inviting the opportunity for downspacing to access untapped resources at closer and closer spacing.","Shown here are the downspacing pilots we are engaged in across our Eagle Ford acreage position. We expect to complete all of these spacing pilots by early next year and to have our technical results at hand by midyear 2013. We remain confident that the majority of our acreage will be developed on 80-acre spacing units with a significant amount of our positions developed on 60- and even 40-acre spacing units.","Slide 26 indicates what increased density drives into our business in terms of increased resource and increased well counts. At maximum density, we have a 40-year well rate life in this play with the potential to access well over 1 billion barrels of oil and natural gas. As we said when we made the Hilcorp acquisition, the Eagle Ford is a company maker.","Slide 27 illustrates how 1,500 miles to the north of the Eagle Ford, our Bakken business continues to deliver promise to the upside. Our view of the production potential of the asset has changed dramatically in the past 5 years while we have remained among the best in the basin in terms of drilling performance and cost control. Our step change to industry standard completion practices in the basin continues to yield positive results for growth with our net peak rate projections now reaching 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for this asset.","And as we continue to focus on downspacing in Three Forks development in the Bakken, we can show, as Slide 28 indicates, again, a 40-year well rate life at 320-acre spacing, which is still not as aggressive as many of our competitors in the basin believe may be possible. Marathon's current estimated recoverable resources has more than doubled in the past 2 years to nearly 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, and the Bakken promises to stand alongside the Eagle Ford as an area of major oil production for Marathon well into the future.","You know, the general view in our industry today is that if you missed the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, you missed the unconventional liquids wave in this country. At Marathon, we think you have to add the Oklahoma Resource basins to that mix. Slide 29 shows our acreage position in the Anadarko Woodford play at 160,000 net acres, together with an additional 100,000 net acres of exposure to well-known oil and gas-producing pays like the Mississippi Lime and the Granite Wash. Though stacked in some areas, we believe we have a nearly 1 billion barrel resource play covering over 0.25 million net acres.","As Slide 30 suggests, while ultimate development and spacing will be determined with further testing, and certainly this is an area that is more dependent on natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing recovery, again, we have a play with a 30-year well rate life in the heart of our U.S. portfolio.","Turning to Slide 31. While it's still early days in the Oklahoma resource basins, and you will recall we cut our rig count to 2 in Oklahoma in response to commodity price pressure, we believe with reasonable price expectations, we can expect to ramp up rig activity around the middle of the decade and to achieve a 25% annual compound growth by 2017. In short, we have exposure to 3 of the most valuable, most growth-oriented and longest running room plays in the United States today.","Turning to Slide 32. I'd like to highlight the significant yet very quiet repositioning we have undertaken in our Exploration business. We're still focused on spending roughly $500 million per year on impact opportunities to create drill bit-led value, or roughly 10% of our going concern CapEx, a substantial amount by any measure. At the same time, we've increased the number of play types and well opportunities we will see in a given calendar year. Our current mix is driven toward proven hydrocarbon basins, large running room potential and a liquids bias. As you can see from the chart, we have access to some of the most exciting basins in the world today with scale.","Perhaps the most exciting aspect of our program is that as we have remade the business, our opportunity set didn't go into the next 5-year plan. In fact, as we show on Slide 34, we have up to 15 impact prospects that may be drilled in the next 15 months. Our Exploration business is challenging our unconventional business as to which is the most real-time results oriented.","So all-in, we are poised as a company to continue to demonstrate what we promised. Solid based assets operated at extraordinary reliability for production and financial performance, real growth oriented to liquids and assets we own and control and exciting near-term exploration options to add to our overall growth are recognized in our overall value creation from the business.","I will use Slide 34 to reinforce the messages that Clarence opened with earlier. In our business, execution is everything; from reliability in all our global assets to the daily delivery in our intense resource play activities. Importantly, our continued strength in operational excellence is now matched with a robust portfolio of opportunities highlighted by a decade deep suite of assets in 3 key lower 48 resource plays, representing the potential for thousands of wells and over 2.5 billion barrels of resource.","Together with our base businesses, we have the opportunity to continue to grow our business at a projected 5% to 7% CAGR through 2017. And while volume growth is important, we will continue to manage the business for value-driven growth with a strong focus on returns and cash generation. To that point, an exciting breadth of near-term exploration opportunities gives us a chance to add impact value to our portfolio through development into new growth or other actions. This is without a doubt a great time to be at Marathon Oil Corporation.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard.","Howard J. Thill","Thanks, Dave. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Dawn, I will turn it over to you so we can prompt for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to take my full quota of 2 questions. I guess they're going to both be for Dave. But Dave, looking at the changes and the indicated rates for the wells, it looks like the condensate rate, the 30-day average, has come down a little bit. The high GOR rate has gone up a little bit. But then when we look at the 60-day rate, it looks like they're holding up a little better, particularly on the condensate. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's changed there in terms of your choke management? And specific to that, this morning EOG had their results, and they made a point to say that, \"You know what? It doesn't really matter.\" And they're -- they've gone for the more aggressive chokes. I wonder if you could address that, and then I'll take a follow-up, please.","David E. Roberts","Yes. Doug, thanks for the questions. It's been pretty interesting reading all the comments about choke management. One wouldn't think we've spent that much time talking about it. But I think I would point out on the chart is we've given you actual well results. And so previously, the tight curves represented what we expected in the play, and we've been pretty clear that they were based on essentially running these wells at 16 chokes across the play type. And our practice is pretty straightforward. We bring wells on at 12. At 24 hours, we flip them, or once they settle in, we flip them to 13. Then we go to 14 and generally, we put our wells down the sales line at 14 or less. And so what we're trying to show here is the fact that our wells are holding up on a more predictive basis. We're giving you actual details of how we're actually running these wells. And I think importantly, the most important line on that chart is the EUR number. That number has been as consistent from what we said, and that's what we're saying that these wells are performing exactly as we had anticipated. As a second point, I think we said from the beginning in this play, we're very interested in what our competitors are doing, and I think we've reacted very well to the range of competitors that we have in the Eagle Ford to make sure that we're engaged in best practice. And no reason to doubt what some of these competitors say about managing chokes down or managing chokes up. What I would say is we're going to continue to be focused on ultimate recovery in our wells. We think it's very early days in what we're trying to do in terms of understanding all the reservoir physics. But I think as importantly for us is just facilities optimization, because there's no reason to build out facilities for a maximum rate when ultimately, these -- we're going to be managing declines over time. And so having a discipline around the CapEx and building out facilities to meet expectations in the wells, as long as you get your EURs right, you're doing the best for your shareholders. And that's kind of what we'd say about choke management.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up is kind of a related question. Obviously, you've given us the Burrow as well. I think you talked about \u00bd-inch choke. But what I'm doing is trying to understand is as we look at your projections going forward, which you've obviously taken up for next year, what are your assumptions? And what are the chances that you ultimately end up getting a little bit more aggressive in the way you flow these things? And I guess if I could layer into that, you used to talk about 16 to 20 completions per quarter. So just help us understand what's underlying that increase in target for next year between the choke and the number of wells. And I would leave it there.","David E. Roberts","Well, again, I think the choke issues are really going to be around how we build out our facilities and making sure that our facilities match up with where our production. I will tell you we are experimenting with moving more to a 16 to 18 range in the early days of choke sizes, but I wouldn't get too carried away with that. I think the key issue for us, the 2 things that are going to drive our performance, have driven them this year and are going to drive them into the future, is kind of what we talked about in the opening is our ability, really, to flow past this concept of adding at least 60 wells a quarter. We spud and TD-ed 79 wells in the Eagle Ford last quarter, and that's the basis of our performance. And we're basically in a view now where we're adding completions at a 65 to 70 well per quarter rate. We still built an inventory of wells waiting to be completed of -- in the circa 25 area. So what we're looking at here is over the course of the year, we have driven down our cycle times spud-to-spud 25, which we think is competitive with the areas that we play in the basin. And as importantly, we've driven our well costs down, in the last month or so, into this $8.6 million per-well range that we have prognosed when we first got into this play. That's with bigger fracs, longer laterals, and we're still beating our cycle-time expectations. So the answer in terms of what we're doing in terms of driving production performance this year and into next year is all about execution. We have become as good as anybody in this basin in 12 short months, and we expect to be able to continue that performance into the out-years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think you kind of covered a lot of the performance in the Eagle Ford pretty thoroughly here. And just one question, stepping back and looking at your obviously updated target that involves the Eagle Ford, as well as the Williston Basin. Is there anything from an infrastructure perspective, especially in the Eagle Ford, that could cause some lumpiness? And what is your, like, capacity through the year look like and into, say, 2014?","David E. Roberts","Well I think the macro logistics, particularly in South Texas, are in pretty good shape. My view is you've seen most of the lumpiness from us in really the second quarter of this year when our operating capacity on the drilling completion side kind of got ahead of our infield infrastructure and construction capability. I think the rise that we've seen in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth is we're matched up very well now in terms of our construction capacity in terms of building out infield infrastructure, and we're pretty much on top of getting the connections to the macro outlets. I think we had a 2- or 3-day delay on one in the third quarter of this year. So right now, we're hitting on all cylinders, and so that's the reason we've been able to increase our expectations for next year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And stepping back and looking at the other, I guess, area of the Oklahoma resource-based opportunities that you all identified in, as you look forward and determine whether or not capital needs to go there, especially in some of the liquid areas like the Tonkawa, Cleveland, Marmaton and even the Mississippian, how do you think about spending money there versus some of the international opportunities that you've kind of acquired here in the last 6 to 12 months?","David E. Roberts","Well yes, great questions, Scott. I think what we would say is that our international opportunities are largely exploration, and they're going to sit pretty comfortably within this $500 million a year that we have prognosed as we move forward. For instance, the real shift that we've gotten into is probably lower working interest for more targets, which allows us to fit our CapEx around those opportunities. The real question about Oklahoma is going to be when price recovers relative to the commodity mix that we have there, then we'll have some choices about where we shift our capital largely in the United States. But right now, we're pretty comfortable that we can wait on this. We think we're going to see recoveries, as we mentioned, in the middle of this decade, 2015 or so. And then that will be queued up for us to really move after in an aggressive fashion, and we'll probably have some headroom in our capital programs at that particular time.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And as a follow-up onto that, when you look at the Oklahoma resource opportunities there, are some of the shallower ones a little bit more oil prone? Or are you not quite seeing that covering your acreage position?","David E. Roberts","I think that's the general industry perception is that, for instance, the Granite Wash and the Mississippi are going to be a little bit more oil prone. We're going to do some more work next year, either within the program that we already have, to take a hard look at that, and that'll then form our opinions as we go forward. So we got some work to do there, but I think your going-in assumption is generally correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I had a question on the Eagle Ford. But it was the only U.S. basin within the presentation on which you didn't give new long-term production forecasts. So any reason behind that? Are you still comfortable with us thinking about that as 120,000-barrel-a-day-plus basin by the 2016 time frame or so. Just any color you can provide over the long-term ramp up there would be appreciated.","David E. Roberts","Yes. It's a great question, Guy, and it's a topic of a lot of discussions around here. There's no question in our mind that this oil field shakes out into -- say, getting to those 120,000-, 125,000-barrel a day ranges that we talked about. I think what we're really focusing in on now is now that we've got our capability in hand and really have demonstrated externally, we're going to take a hard look at what the ultimate peak rate and plateau should be for this field in that range. So I think there's a lot of expectations. We just blow past the 120,000. But I think what we're going to look at is what's the best value optimization pathway for us in terms of how the overall facilities work, how we get into overall operating rhythm on a go-forward basis. So we still think and I think it -- the field has been demonstrated. It will do pretty much whatever we want it to do in terms of delivering the volumes that we've suggested. We're going to take a hard look at what's the way to make the most money out here.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is in the Eagle Ford, it looks as if your crude oil volumes as a percentage of your total production fell to a lower level this quarter than it has been recently. I think it's below 65% or so from around 75% before. Just wondering if you could comment on that trend? Is that just reflective of higher activity in the condensate window? Or is that a trend that we should expect to continue based upon what you're seeing in the areas where you've stepped up activity? Just any comments there would be helpful.","David E. Roberts","Yes. As we kind of pointed out when we first got into this thing, we spent a great deal of time in the first 2 quarters of the year really focusing on the oil-prone areas, and a lot of that was just taking care of our lease position. As we move south into the higher-energy areas, more gas, you're exactly right. We're basically seeing a 65% oil take and 17% NGLs plus\/minus on our current production. That's something else that we're really focusing in on, making sure we optimize around. I don't think that it's going to degrade too much further from that because we're really going to focus, particularly in the commodity window we're moving into, to make sure that we maximize the oil revenues and we have opportunity to take out of here. So we'll continue to watch it. But now we have some flexibility on where we actually drill our wells, and we'll be able to probably stay in that neighborhood at least.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel from Citi. On the press release you guys put out not too long ago, I think October 24, you've talked about how you guys are engaged in discussions with the potential of sale of a portion of your interest in AOSP. Can you give us an update on that? And then give us an idea what you would do with the proceeds from that asset sale if it was consummated?","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. Faisel, this is Clarence. And really, there's nothing to update at this point. I think as we said, we've engaged in discussions with respect to a sale of a portion of our interest. And really, at this point in time, there's nothing to say. If and when we have a definitive agreement, certainly we'd be prepared to talk more about that at that time, particularly as to what we would do with the proceeds.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And is -- on this Burrow's 2-H well, what's the 30-day flowing rate? I think I missed that number. I don't know if you gave that number or not.","David E. Roberts","We didn't give that. I don't think we've gotten to 30 days quite yet, Faisel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Clarence, a bit more of kind of high-level question, given we've had a lot of detail, very helpful detail on mostly on the U.S. I was just wondering, given the success that you've demonstrated by, I guess, focusing back into the U.S. or attacking the new opportunity in the U.S. onshore and I guess less spending internationally, how are you thinking about your spending going forward in terms of how you balance between, perhaps, accelerating your spending in the U.S. and the extent to which you want to continue, if you like, the more legacy exploration program? That's kind of the thrust of what I was asking.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. I think, Paul, I would say that it's our intent to remain a global company. You will not see us pull back our horns and become a purely U.S. or North America company. And so today, as we look at the international arena, the best opportunities we see are in exploration, as evidenced by the enhanced program and opportunity set Dave talked about earlier. I think in terms of accelerating the pace of our resource play pursuits, as we indicated earlier, having the opportunity set we've now developed gives us the optionality around doing just that. But as I said in my comments, we'll do that depending upon the commodity price environment and cost environment that we see. And so I think we certainly, as Dave has indicated, will focus on value optimization. And value optimization today in the resource plays really means staying away from that natural gas, decreasing, to the extent possible, our exposure to NGLs until we see that market come back and instead, focusing on the liquids, on crude oil and condensate. And perhaps that could have some impact on slightly lower rates, slightly lower volume, but again, as we've said, it really is about value optimization. So you'll continue to see us seek the best opportunities for growth on a global basis. And I'd simply go back to the earlier part of the decade in the 2001-2002 time frame, where people had a view we were leaving the U.S. to invest solely  internationally. We built some tremendous legacy assets internationally that are big providers of our cash today, but we didn't abandon the U.S. And fortunately we didn't, because we're back again now investing very significantly there. And of course, as Dave talks about, for example, some of the Oklahoma basins, a lot of that is a legacy acreage that we've had for some time. So we simply want to position ourselves in places where we know there's a great deal of resource and then we can turn our people, our capital and our technology lose on creating value from that.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I understand. And then my follow up is a double follow-up. It's related. Does this mean, given that you've essentially upgraded your volume, at least relatively near term, that we shouldn't think about an attendant upgrade in CapEx? And secondly, I was wondering, once the current disposal program is completed, would you -- with what you just said, it indicated that, that would kind of be the end of that program, or would you be looking to reload for a second round of focus, if you like? And I'd leave it there.","Clarence P. Cazalot","Yes. I think in terms of the capital programs, Paul, still consistent with what we've talked about before. I think we've got some illustrations in our presentations. And if you look at it, it's between $5 billion to $5.5 billion of CapEx per year. And with respect to future asset sales, I would simply ask you to look back at what we have done historically. And we've had a almost continuous program, if you will, of reviewing our portfolio, looking at how we can best optimize the value of that portfolio and in many cases, it results in dispositions and then reinvestment of that into what we would see as more profitable growth. So the bottom line is we continue to review our asset base, and I would expect that you'll continue to see an asset sale program from us on an ongoing basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question, it's something of a follow-up on the last question. I know it's early stage in the potential stake sale for AOSP. Yet can you discuss the driver for considering that sale? I mean, is it more than high grading the portfolio here as you get larger? And maybe some statement on the value of your shares or a emerging and better investment opportunity to elsewhere. Is there more to read into that?","Clarence P. Cazalot","So I would say, Evan, it's -- I don't want to speculate simply because, as I've said, we've not reached a decision. But I think as you think about the AOSP project, I would simply say what we've said all along, and we believe it is a world-class asset. It is tremendous resource pays with the opportunity to grow it well into the future, and technology is going to allow us to do that cheaper in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. But again, at the same time, it is a large nonoperated asset. It is, perhaps to your point, an asset we don't think the value of which is fully reflected in our stock price. So as we look at that, is there an opportunity perhaps to capture value and either reinvest that in profitable growth to strengthen our balance sheet or return some cash to our shareholders, all of those are considerations as we look at that asset and other assets that we have on a continuous basis.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, and that's helpful. Maybe I have a follow-up on the Eagle Ford. Just to confirm, 85,000 boes a day is net full year guidance. And also on the downspacing potential, I know you've been testing that throughout the year, yet in highlighting that potential today, should we presume that you are encouraged by results which aren't necessarily early, but maybe not fully ripe for disclosure yet?","David E. Roberts","Yes, Evan. I will confirm the 85,000. And trust me, we've thought long and hard about that, and that's another big step-up for us. But -- so that's what we're going to do next year. And on the downspacing, as you know, we're a technically driven company. We're going to wait for the analysis. But I will tell you we're -- I'm confident, as I said, that this thing is going to be downspaced. In certain areas you're going to see some pretty close wells.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, can you just confirm for me whether you're already out from the HBP into oil PADD drilling at this point?","David E. Roberts","No, Paul. We're -- I think we're consistently saying we're probably in the range of 75% through with that. Next year, probably about midyear, we'll be in the mode of being -- have all our HBP behind us in the Eagle Ford.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I wanted to ask that. One of your competitor has indicated when they moved from the HBP into the PADD drilling, for several months initially, that have a -- probably where we see a temporary delay in the well completion, and as we saw that, production will become more back-end loaded or that they're pretty flat during the transition period. Should we assume that as you move out from the HBP into the PADD drilling by mid of next year, that this could potentially have some temporary effect on your production?","David E. Roberts","Well, Paul, I mean, I think the issue is how many of your completions on a given quarter are tied up in a PADD, because your point is that you could have unevenness as you had to complete several wells before you could bring them on. I think what we -- what I would say against the well stock of -- in any given year of 250-plus wells a year, that you're probably going to see some of those effects, but it's not going to be something to where it's going to be problematic.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you do not expect this going to have any meaningful impact to you?","David E. Roberts","Well, let's -- we can talk about meaningful offline if you want, Paul. But I mean, I think there is going to be some unevenness, but I don't think it's going to be something where you're going to see a quarter be washed out because we're engaged in PADD drilling.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And final one, can you remind me how many rigs that you're going to run in 2013? And what is the number of proved?","David E. Roberts","Yes, we -- right now, we're still focused on keeping 18 rigs running in the Eagle Ford. We -- our view is that we will keep our 4 dedicated crews, the 2 \"spot crews\" that we're running in addition to that we'll run through at least the end of the year, and I would expect that at least one of those crews will feature heavily into 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Malone from Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","A broad question on adding rigs. I think you mentioned, if I heard correctly, that you might be doing that later in the decade. What would it take to add rigs in the bigger resource plays in the near term?","David E. Roberts","Well, John, it's a great question. I think the issue for us, as we've said, is we want to live within our means as best as possible. And one of the things that we've already seen this year is we're gaining efficiency, and so we're spending a lot of capital to do what it is we need to do. And I think that the issue for us is we're going to continue to try to balance the business on making sure that we can pay our own way as much as possible in the programs we're in, given the price regimes and the cost regime we're in. So the real thing that's going to have to change relative to Oklahoma and some of the others is if we have a shift in natural gas and natural gas liquids, and then we'll be able to make plays look more competitive with some of the oil-prone plays that we're working on.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on Kurdistan, quickly, which you obviously got a lot of drilling coming out on this exploration site. You've already had some success there. How do you see a development playing out? When do you think you'd start to see some productions to the local market and then ramping up from there?","David E. Roberts","On the 2 nonoperated prospects that we already have discoveries on, we do expect to see smaller scale, circa 10,000 barrel a day, early production systems in place in the first half of next year, likely the first quarter, but I'm giving myself a little room there because we do have winter in that part of the world. I think that's going to do 2 things for us. As we said, it's going to help us test these reservoirs a little bit more effectively. They are complicated, and it's also going to give us ability to test some of the fiscal issues that we're looking at. So you'll have small scale production next year. These are plays that in the event that we elect to go forward with development based on the successful exploration, you could certainly see production in a 5-year window.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First of all, about your hedging program. Tell me if I'm wrong, but it seems like your hedge book has increased quite a bit just in absolute terms since the beginning of the year. Is that part of a trend or more of a onetime item?","Janet F. Clark","Well we actually, at the beginning of the year, didn't have any significant hedges on our equity production. So this is a decision that was made in August and executed at the end of August.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, any -- your bank's encouraging you to do that or just part of your portfolio management?","Janet F. Clark","No. As you know, we're a strong investment-grade company. So we don't have any issues with regard to balance sheet protection per se. But when we looked at the markets late August, it appeared to us that prices were quite attractive relative to the potential for a downside price and deterioration, and so we put the hedges in place. Now you might have remember that back in 2010, I believe, we did the same kind of thing and opportunistically put hedges in place for about a year at a time, and that turned out well. This one, so far, has turned out well for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have Doug Leggate online with -- from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry for re-prompting, but I just had a couple of quick, more mundane questions. Maybe for Janet, just looking at the earnings, it struck us that there were some nonrecurring items in here that could have been stripped out, and I just wanted to get your perspective on it. First of all, on the corporate charges, there was no tax offset as you normally have. And also, on the write-off of the Eagle Ford acreage that you're selling, I'm just curious as to why they weren't stripped out, and if you could help us understand what was going on with the corporate tax offset.","Janet F. Clark","Sure. The unproved property impairment ordinarily comes as part of exploration expense and therefore, we don't treat it as special items. Obviously, it is nonrecurring. It's noncash, and we wanted to call it to your attention and treat it as you will. In terms of the taxes, there are lots of things going back and forth in that account, so -- which are offsetting. But as you know, with FIN 18, as we look at our effective tax rate for the year, at the end of the third quarter, we can see that we needed to increase the effective tax rate slightly. But of course, that means we have to have the full catch-up for the full year, and so that's what's offsetting it the kind of blend to close to 0. What happened is as we look at what we expect to achieve for the full year of 2012, we are outperforming relatively in the high tax jurisdictions of the U.K. and Norway, particularly, and actually underperforming a bit in some of the lower tax jurisdictions, which drives the overall effective tax rate higher.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it's basically a true-up, Janet?","Janet F. Clark","That's an effective tax rate catch-up, exactly.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I reckon about $0.10, do you think that sort of magnitude is a bit -- would it have been otherwise, $0.10 delta, meaning on the EPS?","Janet F. Clark","It was about a 1% effective tax rate change.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. For the full year though?","Janet F. Clark","Through the third quarter.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My other one, if I may, is just very quickly for Dave. The disclosure on the exploration, Dave, at least, the Diaman well, I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it properly, in Gabon has not really got a lot of attention from you guys, at least. Can you give us some color as to what your expectations are? Obviously, it's subsalt, and it's in a fairly hot area. So I'm just -- if you could give us any color and your expectations, and I'll leave it there.","David E. Roberts","Well, we generally leave that to the operator, Total, and I'm sure you could raise that with them. But pretty clearly, that's one of the most exciting areas of the world. Gabon, obviously, it sets up well because you have onshore and near shore production, and so we would expect this to trend out in the deepwater like we've seen in the other areas of West Africa. And we're anxiously awaiting the spud of this well in the first quarter of 2013.","Operator","We have Faisel Khan online from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. Of the 18 rigs that you've got running in the Eagle Ford, where you have these -- where do you have these rigs spaced out? Is it mostly in Karnes County or Gonzales? Or where would you have most of the operation kind of running right now?","David E. Roberts","Well, I guess in terms of what our ultimate for the year is going to be, half of our activity is in Karnes County and then another quarter is featured in DeWitt and Gonzales, and then the rest are scattered around. So the 3 core counties is where we do most of our work.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if you can just give us an update or a reminder of where your capital spending projections are for the Eagle Ford and what the breakdown is between production and also infrastructure for 2012.","David E. Roberts","Yes. We're still talking, all-in, with the things that we're doing, in between the $1.5 billion, $2 billion for what we'll spend in the Eagle Ford for operating CapEx. And I would kind of point you to on the order of magnitude of $200 million to $250 million in terms of facilities.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question really on Libya. It's -- the last 2 press releases, you've excluded that production from your sort of guidance. At what point in time do you bring this back in? And then if you could just elaborate a little bit more on this gas sale, how it works, at it -- we'd appreciate that. I'd appreciate that.","Janet F. Clark","In terms of guidance on Libya, until we have a good sense of what's going on in the ground, have expats located in Tripoli, have been out to the field so that we can understand what is the sustainable rate and what -- it's a better sense to have a forecast of that rate. We're going to keep that separate from the overall forecast. So it's hard to say, given some of the recent hostilities there, when that time will be.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So there's no company man on the ground or expats on the ground in Libya?","Janet F. Clark","Not at this time. Dave?","David E. Roberts","Faisel, I'll take that one. I think the distinction is that we have people, on occasion, rotating into Tripoli because we believe the security situation there supports that. We do not have expats on the ground near the producing assets, which are in the \"deep desert.\" And I think that's one of the areas that we're going to have to sort before we move forward. Now with respect to the gas contract, basically the way people should think about that is we will show an increase in production relative to the gas contract of about a little over 2,000 barrels equivalent per day, 14 million cubic feet until April when the second phase of the fair project comes on. And then that number will jump to 30 million cubic feet a day for us until we make it up. So it's over a period of about 2 years that we'll make up that shortfall.","Clarence P. Cazalot","It's the underage, the underlift.","Operator","I think we have John Malone online for Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just following on Faisel's question on where rigs are located. In Oklahoma, where are you drilling currently? Where are you focusing?","David E. Roberts","The rigs are running in the Knox area to the south of the wood -- Anadarko Woodford. So -- but they'll bounce back and forth between the -- what we call the Cana, which is just to the north of that. And next year, we'll probably branch out into some of the areas we've talked about.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you elaborate a bit on Innsbruck, just where it stands right now and what the hopes still are?","David E. Roberts","Yes. I think as we indicated in the release, we're near the bottom of the hole, and we've gone through a series of objective zones. They have been less than encouraging. We probably got, depending on what the well will allow us to do, potentially between 2, 2 days in a week to go before we get to the bottom of the hole and the last possible objective, and then we'll obviously update people on what we came to.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Howard Thill.","Howard J. Thill","All right, John. Thank you, and thank, everyone, for joining us and your questions on this call. And we look forward to seeing you in the future. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to call myself or Chris Phillips.","Thank you.

My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn it over to Zach Dailey. You may begin, sir.","Zach Dailey - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Welcome to Marathon Oil's third quarter earnings call. Following the opening remarks from President and CEO, Lee Tillman, we'll open the call up for Q&A. Also joining us this morning are Mitch Little, Executive Vice President of Operations, and Pat Wagner, Interim CFO and Vice President of Corporate Development.","As a reminder, today's call may contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Please read the disclosures in our earnings release and our SEC filings for a discussion of these items. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the quarterly information package on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach, and let me add my good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments and open the call for questions.","Our key takeaways today are excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter, while achieving cash flow neutrality, increasing rig activity in the fourth quarter within our original budget to prepare for sequential growth in the second half of 2017, and line of sight on 15% to 20% resource play CAGR at flat $55 WTI.","Our total company third quarter production was above the top-end of guidance and up sequentially. I'd like to recognize each of our asset teams for their contribution to this outcome. It's their hard work each and every day that delivers these outstanding results for our shareholders.","In the STACK and SCOOP, production was up over 50% from the prior quarter, as we benefited from new wells to sales and a couple of months of contribution from our recent STACK acquisition. We continue to balance leasehold demands and acreage delineation in the STACK, and brought some outstanding Meramec oil and volatile oil wells to sales that are, on average, exceeding type curves on both our legacy and acquired acreage.","Our Bakken team delivered the best industry Three Forks well in the past three years on our East Myrmidon acreage, and extends the trend of basin-leading performance set last quarter in West Myrmidon. The Eagle Ford asset team continued to drive down completed well costs. This quarter's wells averaged just under $4 million, further enhancing their outstanding returns. And our focus on the oil window at reduced stage spacing is improving the already strong economics in the play.","Internationally, we had an excellent quarter with Equatorial Guinea achieving their highest quarterly production since 2013, following the successful start-up of the Alba B3 compression platform in July. That contributed to a 10% sequential increase in international E&P's quarterly production volumes. And OSM delivered record quarterly production and its lowest unit cost in the history of the mine.","On the portfolio side, we just sold some of our non-operated waterflood and CO2 assets in West Texas and New Mexico for proceeds of $235 million before closing adjustments, which brings our total for non-core asset sales to over $1.5 billion since August of last year. You should expect portfolio management to continue as we drive to maximize capital allocation to our lowest cost, highest margin opportunities.","With our ongoing non-core asset sales and recent STACK acquisition, our commitment to concentrating and simplifying our portfolio to the U.S. resource plays is clear. Couple that with the $5.3 billion of liquidity, including $2 billion of cash we have on our balance sheet along with outstanding operational execution and a very competitive cost structure, we're poised to continue our execution momentum in 2017 and achieve profitable growth within cash flow at moderately higher prices.","While our planning process is still under way, our preliminary five-year view for resource play production supports a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% within cash flows at flat $55 WTI.","With that, we can begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And from Bank of America we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Lee, back in September you raised the type curve on, I guess, your over-pressured Meramec wells, but you're substantially outperforming it seems on those latest results you announced last night. I guess I could say the same thing about the normally pressured areas. So, I guess, can you layout for us what inning you think you're in, in terms of revising your resource backlog in the basin? And maybe the same question on the drilling backlog also in terms of number of locations?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think you're right that we had given a bit of an update on our Meramec volatile oil curve in our last disclosure. We continue to be very encouraged by result in both the black oil window as well as the volatile oil window. And I would say right now it simply comes down to continuing to amass sufficient production history to have confidence with coming back out with a revision. But clearly, the bias in, and I would say across the STACK play is with an upward vector. So, I would just say stay tuned on that count.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a quick clarification on that, Lee. The proppant loading is obviously substantially larger, but I don't think you gave any costs associated with that. Would you see that as a go-forward model or are you still testing the limits at this point?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Doug. This is Mitch Little. We didn't provide a cost update on the volatile oil wells, but we're in the neighborhood between $8.5 million to $9 million on the wells we delivered in Q3. Still fairly early in the learning curve. We would expect to be able to continue to look for other efficiencies. Certainly, as we go to pad drilling in some areas, we would capture efficiencies there. So, we're never done focusing on trying to drive costs down and returns up.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My last one, if I can just squeeze it in real quick. You've given \u2013 you've gone back to giving guidance on the unconventional growth, I believe, for the next five years. I'm just curious if you could put an activity level around that and maybe some range of what the balance of the portfolio might look like in that timeline. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, Doug, we did provide what I would kind of call some benchmark guidance linked to a flat $55 deck. We're, obviously, still in our planning process and won't really release formal budget guidance until kind of February, first quarter of next year. But we thought it was critical to provide some visibility of the growth potential within the resource play portfolio, and that's what really drove it.","And again, although we didn't link it specifically to activity levels, I mean, you should expect that that represents a ramp-up across all three of our plays, and that's somewhat indicative of the action that were already taken in the fourth quarter of this year to begin the initial stages of that ramp-up to get to that sequential growth in the second half of 2017. So, you already see us kind of taking rig count from eight to 12. And as you extrapolate that over time, we should expect in that growth case that we would continue to build on that ramp-up.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers, Lee. Great quarter. Thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Evan Calio. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Lee, maybe if I just follow up on that, the growth guidance in your last response. I mean, I just \u2013 could you help me put the scenario, the resource growth scenario in perspective? I mean, what does that assume for the non-resource portfolio under the same parameters within the cash flow of $55? Is that a...","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...controlled decline, or how much of that portfolio is funding the growth within cash flow of the resource portfolio?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, there's no doubt, Evan, that the conventional component of our portfolio, particularly in the areas like Equatorial Guinea and even OSM and the right commodity environment, those are providing significant free cash flow that allow us to redeploy that into the unconventional business. But again, given that we're going to give much more granular guidance in the first quarter, what I would say though about 2017, and perhaps the way to think about it, Evan, is that we would anticipate on the order of 90% of our capital program being allocated to the resource plays as we look toward 2017. So, you should expect that we'll be minimizing, to the extent possible, any plowback into the conventional assets.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. And my second question \u2013 and I'm trying to keep it outside of 2017 to front run the capital guidance. But can you talk about the capital allocation among the resource plays? I mean, I understand STACK has the first call on capital, but you guided two rigs here into the Eagle Ford. I presume your strategy is to hold Eagle Ford flat, and I guess the same is strategy as it relates to the Bakken, at least East Myrmidon, where I know you have 200 locations. When would you further accelerate there relative to your other plays? If you could talk about that in the longer-term, I'd appreciate it.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Certainly, capital allocation for us, it starts, first and foremost, with the objective of living within our cash flows, living within our means. That's the overarching objective. But within that objective, and certainly this applies to 2017 and beyond, our first call on capital, as you rightly described, Evan, is going to be in Oklahoma and specifically achieving our strategic objectives in the STACK, which are first and foremost leasehold, after that really delineation. And then really thirdly is preparation for full field development in the STACK.","As we meet those objectives over the next year or two, from that point on, to the extent that we have free cash flow to \u2013 or cash flow to deploy, it's going to be done on the basis of the best risk-adjusted returns. And what we see today, of course, is that Eagle Ford is still very strongly competing. It has some of the best economic returns in our portfolio. But with the recent results in the Bakken that we highlighted, including the East Myrmidon result this quarter, Bakken is now competing very strongly for capital allocation as well.","So, it's going to be a balance. It's going to be modulated based on our ability to deliver that within our means. But that's the way you should think about it. It's first and foremost our strategic objectives in Oklahoma, and then we're going to allocate based on the best risk-adjusted return.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a quick follow-up. With the rigs added in the quarter and relative to (12:26) PayRock and otherwise, can you give us a resource CapEx run rate exiting 2017? I'll leave it at that. Exiting 2016, sorry.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. We would again \u2013 many of the rigs that we're adding, which are the four rigs that we talked about going from the eight to the 12, actually the fifth rig has already been added into Oklahoma, and I believe will spud its first well tomorrow. So, we've already added that rig. The incremental rigs in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken will be added a little bit toward the backend of the quarter, but again it's preparing us for momentum into 2017. So we'll exit right at that 12 rig count number going into 2017. And then we'll evaluate that as we look at our price view at the time we release our budget. We'll adjust that, as necessary, to modulate the ramp, again, to deliver within cash flows.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Ryan Todd on line. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple questions. I mean, first off, on your results in STACK, I mean, the great looking long laterals that we saw in the quarter with a couple wells. I mean, how much acres do you think is conducive to long laterals at this point? And any guidance on what the mix might look like between long and short laterals in 2017?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ryan. This is Mitch. I think we have talked about this a little bit before, but on the newly acquired acreage, we see about 50% being conducive to XLs. On our total position, that's closer to 30% where we stand today. We are actively working with other operators to consolidate positions. We actually added about 11 units last quarter through those consolidation efforts. So, we would expect that to grow over time, but where we sit today is around 30%, a little bit over.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then maybe on portfolio management, you mentioned it in the prepared comments. I mean, you're down to very little outside of the U.S. resource space at this point. I mean, effectively just the oil sands \u2013 predominantly just the oil sands and Equatorial Guinea. Any thoughts \u2013 I mean, I guess longer term on either one of those strategic to the portfolio, any thoughts on actively marketing positions? I mean, where do you see those over the next five years, I guess?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think that, first of all, just our non-core asset program in general, Ryan, we still believe that there are still some assets outside of the resource plays that we need to address. Those are, obviously, smaller in scale and will be deemed non-strategic to our go-forward plan.","The larger asset, Equatorial Guinea, we just completed a pretty strong investment cycle there. We've seen the performance of that asset, really the best performance since 2013. We want to continue to build on that. We view that as core from the standpoint of providing significant free cash flow, both cash flow from the PSC as well as cash flow from the equity method investments that we have in country. And then, OSM, I think \u2013 and again, in today's environment, OSM is still delivering very strong cash flow that can be redeployed in the portfolio. But from, I'll say, a strategic long-term fit, a non-operated position in the mine is something that we'll continue to evaluate as to its fit in our long-term portfolio.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Simmons, we have Guy Baber on the line. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Appreciated the medium-term overview of what you think the unconventional assets are capable of generating from a growth perspective. Now, understanding you can't give specific guidance, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the overall growth profile for the total company. So, that 15% to 20% CAGR, looks like it could translate to a total company growth rate in the high-single digit, maybe even low-double-digit type range on a five-year CAGR including the oil sands. Is that the type of growth rate, Lee, you envision for a company of Marathon's size, roughly 400,000 barrels a day? Is that how we should be thinking about the company?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, you're right, Guy. I mean, we haven't gotten into specifics yet on the rest of the portfolio. We're still actively in our budgeting cycle, but I think the numbers you've thrown are certainly in the general ZIP code. And as a large-cap company, we think that that range is really where we need to be, to be competitive with the portfolio work that we have done. We think that's the right place for us to be for our shareholders. And, again, that's all going to be governed with the proviso that we're going to deliver that growth within cash flows, while paying our dividend at an enterprise level. And to me, that's an important and relevant distinction.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Absolutely. And then, one more on portfolio management. The type of growth you're discussing now on the unconventional plays, when it translates to total company growth and then you look at the well result improvements you're realizing, has that meaningfully raised the bar for you all in terms of any incremental meaningful acquisitions? And are you comfortable with the overall weighting that U.S. unconventional carries in the portfolio right now or do you like even more exposure? Just trying to understand the appetite for incremental acquisitions and what that growth guidance might mean on that front.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, Guy, we are squarely focused today on execution against our organic portfolio and our three core U.S. basins, and are very comfortable with the inventory and resource potential to drive our mid-term and long-term growth objectives. I think the STACK acquisition that we did in the summer is indicative of a type of opportunity that we will continue to test and evaluate. But in that case, in the case of the STACK acquisition, it really ticked all boxes for us. It was quality, scale. It offered value that could deliver full cycle returns, and it also offered a very attractive upside.","And really any opportunity, any resource capture opportunity would have to compete on that same basis and come into the portfolio immediately to compete for capital allocation. So, it's a relatively high bar to make that occur. And again, we're very happy with the organic inventory. The teams are squarely focused on accelerating and delivering value from what we have today.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you. And then last one for me. The macro oil backdrop, obviously, remains pretty fluid. OPEC has been unpredictable. You've talked about restoring operational momentum, increasing the rig count. Were oil to continue to regress down into the \u2013 below the mid-40s, into the low-40s, how do you think about the flexibility of increasing the rig count? Is this temporary weakness something you're willing to look through in terms of oil prices? Just how do you think about accelerating activity levels just in the midst of still a pretty fluid oil backdrop here?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No doubt prices have gone through a little bit of softening here as of late. I think fundamentally, Guy, we think that supply and demand are starting to come more into balance. I think it's taking much longer than many anticipated. We've always viewed 2016 as a very transitional year. I think as we look out to 2017, I would kind of characterize it as a recovery year, where we think that likely we'll see supply and demand come more into balance as we get later in the year. And quite frankly, our internal price forecast are shaped to reflect that, a bit lower in the front half and a bit higher in the back half of the year.","But to your point on flexibility, the beauty of the short cycle investments remains our ability to move and respond very quickly to the predominant price signals and price view that we have at that point in time. So, our view was that this was a step toward delivering on our sequential growth in the second half of 2017. But as we see the macro environment turn a different way, we've got significant flexibility to adjust our capital program, as well as look at our cost structure in general. So, we're not concerned necessarily with this latest softening of pricing. But we do need to be mindful of where the macro and our overarching objective of staying cash flow positive or neutral in 2017.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have Ed Westlake on line. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, good morning, Lee. Congratulations on the momentum across all the plays. Eagle Ford proppant loading increased substantially in 3Q. Maybe just a little bit of color about when you expect to see the change in completion start to show up. I mean, obviously, you've released some of the wells.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah, I think \u2013 and I'll let Mitch chime in. But at a high level, we have been operating Eagle Ford at below maintenance capital. Where we stand in the third quarter, we view now as our activity being supportive of holding that level flat moving forward in time. And, of course, part of that calculus is the fact that we are seeing improvements in the way that we're completing even the wells in the Eagle Ford, particularly in the oil window. And with that, maybe I'll let Mitch talk a little bit about what the teams are doing.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ed. I think what I would say is the third quarter was really the first quarter where we had gone \u2013 sort of made the holistic shift to this being our base design in the oil window. This 200-foot stage spacing, kind of 400,000 pounds per stage for a conventional job, we were trialing that earlier in the year to build confidence in it. So, we've got some limited data now, a few dozen wells that are approaching a year or so of production. We've talked about before the increases that we have seen from tighter stage spacing at 200 feet versus 250 feet, showing initial uplift in the 15% to 20% range. So, certainly that'll be our base design going forward, and we'll continue to share the results as they come in, like we did in the third quarter.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, I guess a follow-up on the oil sands. I mean, fantastic operational performance, as you say, cash flow and likely free cash flow. And obviously that then creates a value in that asset at some point, should someone else be interested in the asset, your stake. Maybe just a little bit of an update in terms of where you can see sort of steady-state production, CapEx and OpEx, as the team continues to improve that asset.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Well, Ed, I would say that third quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I mean, we had production at an all-time record. I think the operator has done a great job of continuing to put pressure on operating cost. And the combination of all that delivered, again, a very exceptional unit operating cost there. And because our realizations off the back of the upgrader are largely linked to WTI, with a small component to WCS, the asset does have a lot of cash flow potential. So, I have to give a lot of credit to the operator in generating quite a strong quarter.","Now, as we look forward, even in the fourth quarter we have planned turnaround that will ultimately impact, of course, volumes, which will have a feedback impact into the unit cost as well. So, I wouldn't extrapolate the third quarter as the base business model. But what I would extrapolate is that our ability to generate higher reliability and lower cost in the mine, that trend is now becoming pretty well-established. And I think that's just going to make the asset more valuable, not only to our shareholders, but certainly in the event that strategically we elect to monetize at some point in the future.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we have Roger Read on line. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Quick question, I guess, on the SCOOP\/STACK and kind of looking at slide 11, talks about protecting the leasehold while doing the delineation. Can you give us an idea maybe where you are in terms of the efficiency of drilling in the SCOOP\/STACK today? And then how you think about that changing as more of the acreage becomes truly HBP and you can really focus on the efficiency side?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Roger. This is Mitch again. I guess what I would say or what I would share with you, it's a mixture of well types out there still and we are in the delineation phase. But on average, across the STACK, our drilling efficiency is about a 40% increase in feet per day, if you looked as compared to a year ago and mixing the wells, kind of 10% to 20% lower completed well cost, and that's with higher intensity completions in most cases. So, we're still on the efficiency curve, if you will. We haven't moved to fulfill development, the advantages of pad drilling, the advantages of continuity with drilling crews and applying the latest technology. So, we would still expect to be able to continue to see some learnings there and our teams are certainly driving on that, and with a real focus on flat times as well as drilling rates.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And kind of a follow-up to some of the earlier questions about the guidance for second half of 2017, the growth in a $55 oil environment. What should we think of, Lee, as the \u2013 I don't know. It's pretty easy to understand, I guess, the positive. If you get crude above $55, it's easy to spend more money. But is it a sub-$50 world we need to be concerned about in the first half of next year, is maybe pushing these plans into 2018 from 2017? Or \u2013 I don't know. I guess we're all just trying to understand kind of what are the guidelines for how we should think about setting things up for 2017 and beyond.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, certainly, Roger, our intent is to provide a bit more granularity on that in the first quarter. But just looking at kind of where we stand today, obviously, we're shaping our price forecast across 2017 to, obviously, reflect a bit lower price in the beginning of the year and somewhat of strengthening toward the back end of the year. And what we've talked about is that, we can maintain certainly that sequential growth case into the low 50s, and that's kind of ex any hedging success that we have as well.","And so, if you were to say \u2013 let's say, that we languished in the environment that we're in today, we would have to just assess that as we move into 2017 and we would adjust accordingly. If we see that being persistent, then you're right. Then we may choose to push that ramp out a bit in time. But today, we want to make sure that we're on a trajectory that's going to deliver that ramp, recognizing that we have full optionality and flexibility to adjust early next year as price dictates. But again, our overarching objective is going to be cash flow neutrality.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Brian Singer on line. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You touched on the oil sands operating cost. Can you talk about the operating cost trends elsewhere in the portfolio? It seemed like it came down for the international business outside of oil sands and parts of the domestic continue to come down as well. Can you just talk to the sustainability of some of these costs \u2013 op costs reduction that we've seen and how that might change in a $55 world that you're talking about potentially for 2017?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Brian. I'll touch on it, and then others can add to this. But as you point out, we shared an update on our operating cost, and I think on an absolute basis we're down 37% year-over-year in North America and 31% overall. As you'd expect and as is common, that's a combination of some structural efficiencies that are sustainable and some commercial savings across the board.","I think that's an impressive rate of change and we've seen it across the industry. Our work's never done in that area. We'll continue to push for further efficiencies. Probably not fair to think about it as the same rate of change going into the next year, but we're going to continue to do that. And I think we've traditionally talked on the order of 50% commercial, 50% structural and efficiency gains across the total spend.","It's probably a little bit higher weighted to the structural and the operating side with things like the water handling system that we put in the Bakken, moving our water on pipe there. We're up to about 70% of our produced water on pipe now up there. And certainly, some staff rationalizations, getting more efficient using technology across the operation. So, a little bit heavier weighted on the structural, I would say.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","And I would just add, and the case just building on our discussion around OSM, assets like that that, for instance, have a very large energy component to them will have some flex depending upon where prices go as well. So, there's a plus and a minus there from an asset like OSM's perspective, where, yeah, you may get a price response which is going to help you, of course, from a realization standpoint. But from a cost standpoint, because a large component of your production costs are around energy, you're going to feel a little bit of the burn on the energy cost as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. And then, just a follow-up on the Bakken with some of the well productivity and efficiency that you're seeing from your slide 15, I think, it is. It certainly looks like some of these wells are trending above type curve. Is your focus, as you start to increase activity in the Bakken, just more on the well performance and the well side? Or did you also see some \u2013 do you also see the potential for your inventory in the Bakken to improve as a result of the results that you're seeing?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","I certainly think that from an inventory standpoint, we have basically driven more inventory into what we would call kind of Tier 1 in competing for capital allocation by these changes in well productivity. I mean, kudos to the Bakken team. I think they have used this down cycle to really put themselves in a much competitive stance in terms of capital allocation.","But also just looking at their lease operating expense, Mitch mentioned the water handling system that was installed. And when we look at other operators, we feel very confident that we are one of the low-cost operators, and that's just contributing to our margin in the Bakken. They had a limited amount of capital. We haven't been drilling in the Bakken since really early in 2016, but we've completed the Clarks Creek pad and then, of course, the Maggie pad, which demonstrated these very strong results.","And when we look at these just from a sheer return basis, they're competing head-to-head with some of the best in our portfolio. And that team has, again, positioned themselves now to participate fully in the capital allocation discussion, and it's one of the key drivers of why we're putting a rig back to work there at the end of this year.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. And I'll just a little bit to that, Brian. Certainly, some of the learnings in the Myrmidon area that we've employed over the last two quarters are going to be transferable and will be trialed in other areas as well. The team is very focused, as we are across all basins, in upgrading all of our inventory. So, watch this space. It's not one size fits all, certainly, but we do think there are some transferable learnings.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Pavel Molchanov online. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Two different questions for you. First on the 15% to 20% long-term growth target for the resource plays. What rig count does that assume implicitly and how might that be allocated between the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Oklahoma?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, we haven't provided specific rig count numbers with that CAGR. Our intent, though, would certainly be to provide more definition specifically around 2017 in the first quarter when we do our capital budget release. But obviously, the growth engine for us going forward is going to be Oklahoma. So, there's going to be a significant ramp-up in both capital allocation as well as rig activity in Oklahoma. The other assets, Bakken and Eagle Ford, just due to their potential to generate very high returns, will continue to compete. And they give us the optionality to modulate between growth and cash flow generation in those particular assets, and we'll take full advantage of that.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, secondly, very different geography. You guys are one of the few international operators in Libya. We have heard just in the headlines that Libyan volumes have doubled since roughly August. Are you seeing any of that substance on your own acreage or is that mostly other people's stuff?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Pavel. This is Mitch. You're aware, I think, that our position is within the Waha Concessions. And while we're encouraged with the lifting of force majeure and the restart of production there, production through the month of October has kind of ranged between 30,000 and 50,000 gross barrels a day. Liftings have commenced from the Ras Lanuf terminal, but they have not yet commenced from Es Sider. Through the various actions that have taken place in Libya over the last couple of years, there is certainly damage at the terminal that needs to be repaired and also out in the fields, particularly in some of the pipeline infrastructure.","So, we haven't seen a rapid increase above those levels. Repairs are going to be required. They're working diligently on the terminal. We would expect a lifting to occur from Es Sider in the not too distant future. But kind of been in the 30,000 to 50,000 barrel a day range through the month of October, through most of the month.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's very useful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Arun Jayaram on the line. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. My first question is, if you could help us understand in terms of the 15% to 20% growth, is that going to look relatively linear as we think about growth moving forward or maybe the overall shape of that production profile?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Again, Arun, we haven't provided a lot of the character of the shape of the ramp-up. But, obviously, we'll be looking to accelerate pretty strongly in Oklahoma. And given its relative maturity to the other two plays, we should expect pretty significant growth rates within Oklahoma. And then really in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, it becomes a matter of choices around how rapidly do we want to develop those more mature areas.","We can, again, modulate between the level of ramp-up and the level of free cash flow generation in both of those assets. And so, we made some assumptions within that kind of, if you will, 2017 to 2021 view, because we wanted to provide that visibility. But it is really just a benchmark case. It's not necessarily a planning basis for us today. We're not predicting $55 flat for \u2013 through 2017 through 2021. It's just a way for us, again, to provide that visibility and give a bit of a benchmark on the potential that we've got in those three core plays.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Lee, have you guys looked at \u2013 that is a boe number. How would the oil mix change over that time? Do you think you could grow it at a similar rate? Or your thoughts on just oil growth.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. We've obviously looked at it in terms of specific products as well. And without getting into too much specific, you should expect oil growth to be in that same range for the resource plays.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great. And just my follow-up is just, if you guys could maybe elaborate on some of the STACK wells that you reported this quarter. You had some very, very strong wells in eastern Blaine and Kingfisher. Some of the PayRock wells looked a bit mixed, but I was just wondering if you could maybe put some of the PayRock wells into context.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Arun. This is Mitch. I think what we would say for starters is, certainly encouraged with the aggregate performance being about 30% over the type curve. We're strongly in delineation mode and protecting our valuable leasehold. So, not surprisingly, we're going to see a little bit of variability in results, but the wells are delivering expected oil rates. They're delivering oil cuts within the range that we expected based on the wells drilled prior to the acquisition. Seeing a little bit of variability in the GOR. But certainly too early to draw any conclusions from the limited datasets that we have there and encouraged by the early results relative to the type curve.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from Evan Calio. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Great. Thanks for taking my second question here. It's a question for Mitch. I know you provided details on your first operated spacing test in the Meramec, this Yost spacing test. Can you discuss the selection of the six-well spacing perception? I know it's a standard spacing assumption in the PayRock acquisition, yet maybe conservative. And how do you think these tests progress and with the completion design this year, if you would?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Evan. As you rightly point out, the six-well infill in Yost is consistent with kind of our base case assumption at the acquisition. You'll also be aware that we're participating in a number of outside operated infill programs. One, in that kind of general areas is the Clover (42:27) infill, which is going to be testing a tighter spacing, a higher density.","And so, the overall concept I guess I would say for the Yost is, let's go out and prove up our base case assumption, let's leverage learnings from that, along with our outside operated infills. Take those learnings throughout 2017. We'll no doubt have a number of other infill tests and we'll test different concepts, both in terms of staggering vertically and well density within the section. And we'll take those learnings throughout 2017, and then move into more of a full field development mode after that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And the completion design for Yost?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. I think our base case, we're feeding (43:22) that infill in the fourth quarter here. So, the base case would be similar design to what we've been pumping. But as with all these areas, we're taking real-time learnings. We're using our multi-variant analysis model to integrate new well results, and we're doing 3D hydraulic fracture modeling. So, base case would be similar to what we've been doing, kind of the 2,500 pounds per foot, 150 to 175 foot stage spacing, I believe, it is. But we'll continue to optimize that right up to the time the completion rig and frac crew move on location.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Okay. Well, thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for your questions today and certainly your interest in Marathon Oil. Our investment case continues to strengthen, with visibility on competitive long-term growth within cash flows at moderate pricing, the depth and quality of inventory in three of the best oil basins, a very competitive cost structure, balance sheet strength, certainly continued concentration and simplification of the portfolio, and a pure leading leverage to oil. We are squarely focused on those aspects of our business that we control, our execution, and our cost. And we're going to continue to drive to lower the breakeven of our enterprise, which will serve us well regardless of the forward commodity price environment.","And with that, I'll just end by saying thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zach Dailey. Mr. Dailey, you may begin.","Zach Dailey - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks and good morning. Last night, we issued a press release, slide presentation, and investor packet that address our first quarter results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com.","Today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee Tillman, our President and CEO, who will provide a few opening remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Zach, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. After a pivotal 2017, 2018 is off to a great start and has continued our returns-focused momentum with our development capital program on track to deliver over 65% annual improvement in corporate cash returns at strip pricing.","Our differentiated multi-basin model delivered strong 9% sequential U.S. oil growth and our asset-level execution underpinned our confidence to raise our full-year 2018 resource-play guidance while also steering to the upper end of our total company guidance. All of these, with our $2.3 billion development capital budget unchanged.","An important point to note is that our first quarter development CapEx is not ratable due primarily to some higher working interest relative to the remainder of 2018 and other timing effects.","Highlights for the quarter were numerous, but I'd like to underscore just a few. We continue to expand the core of our Bakken and Eagle Ford positions through enhanced well performance in the Hector area and Atascosa County respectively, uplifting economics and inventory quality while generating significant free cash flow from both assets.","Bakken grew production 7% sequentially and continued its basin-leading performance, setting new 30-day oil IP records in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. The June and Chauncey wells in West Myrmidon established new records for the basin and oil production with an average IP 30 of almost 3,500 barrels of oil per day. The Arkin well in the Hector area set a new Williston Basin record for the Three Forks formation at an IP 30 of just over 3,000 barrels of oil per day. And just to underscore the compelling economics of this well, the Arkin has already achieved pay out.","Finally, our West Myrmidon well brought to sales late (3:22) in the quarter achieved a remarkable IP 24 of over 10,000 oil equivalent barrels per day but has not yet achieved 30 days of production. In part because we continue to bring on these basin-leading wells, we are proactively managing gas capture to remain in full compliance with all North Dakota requirements, and have the necessary flexibility to ensure no flow assurance issues as we continue to pursue this high-return program.","Eagle Ford held production flat sequentially and delivered results in Q1 that span the entirety of our acreage position. This included 11 outstanding wells in Atascosa County with an average IP 30 of over 1,600 oil equivalent barrels per day at an oil cut of 76%.","The Eagle Ford continued its focus on enhanced completion designs and contributed significant free cash flow through the powerful combination of well performance and strong LLS-based oil realizations that were above WTI.","Oklahoma and Northern Delaware began their shift to primarily multi-well pad drilling that will dominate the remainder of their 2018 programs. In Oklahoma, oil production grew 25% sequentially, primarily from outstanding base performance that included the Tan infill that came online late in the fourth quarter.","We largely completed our STACK leasehold program in the first quarter and expect to be greater than 90% HBP'd in the STACK by year end. Looking ahead, 95% of our remaining 2018 wells to sales in Oklahoma will be in the over-pressured STACK and SCOOP, the majority of which will come from four multi-well infills.","Northern Delaware, though still early in its development cycle, delivered wells across the Malaga, Red Hills and Ranger areas at an average IP 30 of 1,460 oil equivalent barrels per day at 69% oil cut. Late in the quarter, we brought the first two Cypress infill wells online ahead of schedule and we'll report results once we have 30 days of production from the entire pilot.","Additionally, in the last six months, we've added 165 risked gross co-op locations, with an average working interest of 65% through trades and a small bolt-on, and continue to pursue opportunities that increase our working interest, generate more operated sections and provide more extended lateral optionality.","It's difficult to speak about the Permian without addressing differentials and takeaway. We're currently benefiting from our Midland-Cushing basis swaps and open positions cover us for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discount of less than $1 to WTI for the second half of 2018 and all of 2019. Our swaps will help protect over half our forecasted oil production for the remainder of the year.","On takeaway, it is important to stress that today, Northern Delaware accounts for only about 4% of our overall production mix. However, while we anticipate no flow assurance issues, we are planning for future growth and have expanded our oil gathering agreements and are assessing both gas gathering and FT commitments for the longer term. We are also transitioning our water to pipe throughout the year, which will reduce unit operating costs for the basin.","In addition to our four U.S. resource plays, we continue to generate value from our world-class integrated gas development in E.G. which contributed $124 million of EBITDAX for the quarter despite a turnaround at the LNG plant. This unique gas infrastructure, LNG plant, gas plant and methanol plant is well-positioned to not only deliver free cash flow today but also capture additional equity and third-party gas as the natural point of aggregation in the region.","Our financial flexibility is at the top of our peer group and was further strengthened by receipt of proceeds from Libya and our final Canadian oil sands payment. This flexibility allows us to pursue multiple high-return uses of free cash. But we are taking a disciplined approach and we are not considering large-scale M&A.","Repurchasing shares is an option and we have a $1.5 billion authorization already in place and we can also look at our already-competitive $170 million annual dividend. We have enjoyed higher pricing for just over a quarter but as our confidence in sustainable free cash flow generation continues to grow, we will consider returning additional capital to shareholders and it is a topic of ongoing discussion with our board.","Our objective is to strike the right balance between additional direct return of capital and accretive, opportunistic, low-entry cost resource capture. Specifically, we have successfully added quality-operated locations in the Northern Delaware through trades and a small bolt-on, and have captured over 250,000 acres across multiple onshore exploration plays including a material position in the emerging Louisiana Chalk at less than $900 an acre.","We recognize that these unique resource capture opportunities are episodic and challenging to forecast. We spent $94 million in Q1 and expect another $150 million in Q2, but they offer the potential to generate outsized full cycle returns.","We now expect to grow our resource plays 25% to 30% year-over-year, up from 20% to 25% for both oil and boe with our development capital budget unchanged. And we expect our total company annual growth to be toward the upper end of our guidance, also for both oil and boe. But growth is simply an outcome of our returns-focused capital allocation.","Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company (sic) [Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.].","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning, everybody, and congrats on the strong results.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Guy. Good morning.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","I wanted to start with the Bakken but it looks like you continue to be successful in expanding the core of your footprint there, so really impressive well results from Hector in particular. Can you talk about how that's influencing your view of the depth and the quality of your inventory there? I know you all recently highlighted over 12 years of inventory in the Bakken at this year's pace. But can you put some additional context around that? Just trying to better understand to what degree that inventory is economic, how it will compete because the wells you're drilling right now are obviously very, very impressive.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Guy, maybe just to affirm for everyone on the call, we have talked about the Bakken having a forward inventory at kind of current activity levels of just over 12 years. And the way I think about our success in the Hector today is that we're continuing to delineate across an acreage position there, that's about 115,000 net acres. We have had very strong early success there, record-setting wells there, but we're still marching across that acreage position. And I view this as thus far really providing us an opportunity to uplift the intrinsic value and economics of that 12 years of inventory as we elevate the inventory that resides within the Hector area. Additionally, we are still looking to test other areas this year in the Bakken including Elk Creek as well as the Ajax area as we continue to apply the same workflows that started in West Myrmidon, transition then into Hector. We're looking to apply those as well in these other areas.","So, right now, it's a great outcome. All credit to the team there for their innovation. They are competing strongly at the very top of the portfolio with these kinds of results.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks, Lee. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about the resource play leasing and exploration program. But you've obviously been successful in adding new acreage to the portfolio at low cost. I know you characterize the spending there as episodic and I'm sure you'll be opportunistic, but how should we be thinking of the size or materiality of that program over time? Is there any framework that you could share? I'm really just curious as to how you instill a sense of discipline into the organization there to ensure that you're maximizing the full cycle return potential of the dollars that you're spending in that program as you highlighted.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think you said it well, Guy. It's very difficult for us to forecast in this area because typically these unique opportunities are what we would classify as potential lost opportunities, meaning that if we don't act upon them they're likely going to move away or at least the low-cost entry element of them will move away from us. So, it is difficult for us to forecast. That's one of the reasons why we at least attempted to provide some visibility into the next quarter for you all. So that was an important element.","I think as we consider the scope of it and ensuring that we do apply discipline to this element of our business just like all other elements of our business, it starts with return and capital allocation. When the REx team brings in an opportunity, it has to compete on a similar basis as our other opportunities, meaning that there has to be a path there to achieve economics, full-cycle economics that are competitive with our existing portfolio. These are still exploration plays with a finite chance of success, but we have to be able to see materiality, quality and a value proposition, meaning that they can come in and compete for capital allocation.","The other point that I would make just on the spend question is that as you think about the framework, although we're very excited about the greenfield leasing that we've accomplished, bear in mind that the real work comes after the leasing occurs. We have to get in there then and go through appraisal, delineation, and what we hope is ultimately predevelopment. And all of those activities will require capital allocation. So, as we look forward in time, we have to also consider those future capital needs that are beyond just greenfield leasing.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Guy.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Lee, if the strip is broadly correct, I just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially recommending to the board to return cash to shareholders and just your views on do you think the stock is undervalued and if that's a good use of money just given the strong balance sheet, and the strong free cash flow generation of the company?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, Arun. Yeah. First of all, I want to emphasize that return of capital to shareholders is and has been an ongoing dialogue with our board. We'd obviously discuss our dividend which is very competitive in our space with our board each and every quarter. So that concept of return of capital to shareholders and the constructive tension with other investment opportunities is front and center with the leadership, and with our board each and every time we sit down to discuss it.","What I would say is that going back to my opening comments that repurchasing shares is definitely an option. We have an authorization of $1.5 billion already in place. We can also consider the level of our dividend although at $170 million annually, it's very competitive. That also needs to go into the calculus and you're right. I mean, we've \u2013 certainly as we look ahead, we absolutely see the opportunity to get into a mode of sustainable cash \u2013 free cash flow generation. And I think as we move through that, returning additional capital to shareholders will feature in that forward dialogue.","I would maybe mention though just a few things there is that first of all, we feel that we need kind of a minimum cash balance to run our business given the scale and scope of it of around $750 million of cash on hand and that's plus or minus. I would also point out that all companies are at different stages in their respective business models. We have addressed our balance sheet very clearly last year. We've also largely completed our major portfolio dispositions, meaning that we don't expect additional near-term material proceeds.","As I was just chatting about with Guy, we also recognize that leasing cost is just the first step in capturing some of these low entry cost opportunities. So, we must consider those future capital needs as well. All that to say is that the bottom line is that all of these factors go into our considerations for pursuing what is the best \u2013 what are the best options for long-term value creation through the use of free cash and I view it it's not an either\/or proposition. We see multiple uses for that including enhancing our direct return of capital. All of that can be accommodated.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for that. And just a follow-up, just want to talk a little bit about the Louisiana Austin Chalk opportunity. Obviously in the late 1990s the industry tried to move into Louisiana with no success there. But I was just wondering if you could talk about this opportunity and obviously EOG has an interesting discovery well, the Eagle Ranch number 1 and if you could talk about maybe the proximity to some of the EOG acreage?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, we plan to provide many more details, Arun, as we move through the year. But obviously the Louisiana Austin Chalk as you mention did go through a bit of a development phase. It was with very early technology designs on the completions side and relatively short lateral lengths as well. We see this, as you know, a natural extension of kind of this Austin Chalk megatrend that goes from Mexico across South Texas all the way over to East Louisiana. And having been one of the leaders in the development of the Austin Chalk and South Texas, we think we're well equipped to get in here and appraise and understand the potential of this.","But I want to stress again that this is exploration. And until we are able to get out in the field, do the necessary technical work, and get some wells down, we don't really know what we have here in terms of forward inventory or resource. But it's exciting and I won't get into where we are on the map, Arun, because we're still obviously active in the play today and so I don't think it's prudent for us to talk those specifics at this present time.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for your comments, Lee.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, everybody. Good morning. Lee, I wonder if I could kick off with the relative capital allocation across the plays. The Bakken obviously continues to impress in terms of incremental well results. So, I'm just curious as to within your stable capital spend for the year, how are you seeing incremental spending in the event the oil prices did stay at these elevated levels?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Doug, we are \u2013 as we've said before, we have calibrated our development capital program at a level that we're comfortable with. We believe it strikes the balance between generating those very strong material improvements and corporate level returns that we talked about early on, on a strip deck. We can \u2013 we see cash return on invested capital improving year-over-year by about 65%.","We will always be looking to, I would say, adjust our capital allocation based on new information throughout the year. But our $2.3 billion development capital spend, that is our spend for the year regardless of where commodity prices tend to track for the rest of the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, to be clear what I was really \u2013 it probably wasn't obvious from my question, what I was really getting at was the relative oil cut in the Bakken relative to the rest of the portfolio. Would the higher oil price impact your decision as to where your relative investment shifts within that stable budget?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you have any plans to step up in the Bakken I guess is what I'm asking.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. No, I got it, Doug. The beauty I think in our portfolio today in our multi-basin model is, Doug, is that we are already biased very heavily toward oil opportunities. And you're right, the Bakken offers a very high crude cut. But I would also point out that even in Atascosa County, we're running upwards above 75% C&C, crude oil cut there as well. So, that does go in.","We look at obviously the product mix, but we're more driven by making sure that we're deploying to the correct overall economic value proposition.","And today, when you look at our relative capital allocation that we described earlier in the year, it's not surprising that a big component of our capital allocation is flowing to both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford while we progressed the early development phases from a strategic standpoint certainly in both Northern Delaware and Oklahoma.","So, we feel that we have already accommodated that, not only the oil cut, but the overall economics that we see in the Bakken in our capital deployment. But again as we get new data, we can always look at adjusting and redeploying within our multi-basin model but I want to stress that the $2.3 billion is the development capital that we'll be working within.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the full answer, my follow-up hopefully a quick one. Last quarter, Lee, you talked about reevaluating the black oil Meramec. I'm just curious if you've got any updates for us this quarter you can share? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Doug, this is Mitch. I'll see if I can address that for you and then carry on if I'm not hitting what you're looking for. But maybe I'd start with breaking down our STACK position a little bit just for context and we put it in the slides, but 70% of our operated DSUs in the STACK are in the over pressured window and about 30% in the normally pressured. And you'll note that for the remainder of 2018, our focus is really in the over pressured areas.","How I would describe it is we completed our first phase of infills in the normally pressured window. The last one of course was the Cerny, the most recent one which we did a multi-horizon test there including Meramec, Osage and Woodford.","We've obtained a massive data set of production, subsurface and intentional data acquisition. We're now integrating that into the same kind of internally developed workflow \u2013 multidiscipline integration workflow that we've applied in places like the Eagle Ford and Bakken to drive the results that you're seeing from us there. I would note and just kind of keep in mind in those two basins, we've got about on the order of 1,500 infills whereas in the normally pressured window, we've got 19 infill locations so far.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","At a different phase, we have taken a few very significant learnings thus far and continue to optimize while we focus in the over pressured area and come back. But certain of the Meramec wells were delivered about $700,000 completed well cost lower than the Eve's and through the first 60 days, we're seeing oil cums that are comparable, so no degradation in performance there.","And we believe we can take cost down even further. We were currently evaluating the design that's more in the $3.5 million completed well cost range. So, continue to advance our learnings, more optimization to do, and while we're in that integration and compilation phase, we're going to shift our focus more into the over pressured area.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mitch, I'd appreciate if you'd answer, maybe just tag on a quick follow-on to that. Just, the prior operator had obviously put up some pretty aggressive wells with some pretty aggressive fracs, is there any consequences of that in terms of your ability to optimally develop it or do you feel as if that's not going to be an issue? (27:25) over stimulated the prior rog (27:27) if you like.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure, Doug. I wouldn't characterize it the way you \u2013 in the way you last stated it. But what I would say is, as we look at the ultimate development plan here, as with all other operators you have to consider the history of that DSU and frankly the surrounding DSUs. And so, the majority of our DSUs do have a parent well or direct offset. That would be true for our industry as well.","The best we can tell, our position there is not too dissimilar from the rest of industry if you consider parent Meramec, Osage or Woodford wells across the STACK normally pressured area in particular.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you so much.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. In the Eagle Ford, you mentioned that your results are expanding the core. Can you give a little more color on what you've seen, how you see the core evolving whether this is kind of improving the economics and the quality of your existing inventory or whether it's actually expanding the inventory this year going forward?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ryan. This is Mitch again. I think if you look back over the past three or four quarters, we've been highlighting in addition to the core Karnes area our activities out in Atascosa, which don't have \u2013 don't benefit from the same quality of rock and necessarily same fluid mix. But we, in taking that multi-disciplined approach that I described earlier, have gotten down to a pretty refined state where we're actually designing the combination of well spacing and completion style sub-regionally and in some cases down to the DSU.","What that's translated to, as we've modified our designs, is a significant upgrading or uplifting of the inventory outside of core Karnes County, and that's why we keep sort of highlighting the results from Atascosa. So, in general, I would say the pressure is on upgrading the returns. The focus is on value optimization, not a significant change to overall inventory.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe in the Permian, I mean, during the quarter you added 165 risked gross locations which is a pretty significant number there via small bolt-ons and an acquisition. I mean, how do you \u2013 how would you characterize the ability to continue to high-grade the portfolio in this way either through swaps or small bolt-ons? Is there a decent amount of running room?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 this is Lee, Ryan. I believe that there remains an incentive for all operators to continue to drive toward more contiguous positions particularly in Eddy and Lea County and Northern Delaware. I think that the progress that the team made over the last six months since we really closed those deals is very solid. But this is going to take time. Particularly, when you start discussing trades, you have to get to the point where you get to an equivalent value proposition with another party, so the incentive may be there.","But, as I like to tell people, no one likes to say they have the ugly baby in the trade. And so it just takes time. And a lot of times, those trades are going to come in smaller bits as well, but we have a dedicated team that is focused on this. We believe it is important for that asset going forward in time to continue to block up what we believe is a great acreage position in Northern Delaware. And we'll keep you all posted. But again, it is going to be \u2013 it's going to come in probably fits and starts and probably in small parcels particularly on the trade side. But it's something that our asset team and our land team are squarely focused on today.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Outside the swaps, are you seeing \u2013 in terms of ability for bolt-ons, is there much stuff there or are there pretty limited opportunities?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. I think for us, the key thing that made that small bolt-on in fourth quarter very attractive was it was essentially a lay-down on our Malaga area, so there was great synergy. It ticked all the boxes for us. It converted non-op locations to co-op locations. It raised our working interest. It gave us more optionality for extended laterals.","So, it was really almost the poster child for what we're trying to do and that's going to be a small group of opportunities that can tick all those boxes and really be a synergistic and accretive add to our position. So, we're going to be very selective. These are going to be smaller in scale. We obviously are not looking at any large transactions here. But to the extent that we find other transactions and that transaction in 4Q is kind of a $60 million deal, we're going to evaluate those and if it fits, we're going to move on them. And that's one of the advantages of having the financial flexibility that we do today.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Lee. Great quarter.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Morris from Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Lee, and very nice quarter.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I'm looking at the two very big West Myrmidon wells that had 24-hour IP rates of almost 11,000, 8,000 barrels per day. Can you give us a little bit of color around how much of that strong performance was being better able to identify sweet spots or landing zones, and how much of it is just the continued evolution of your completion designs here? And part of what I'm trying to determine is how repeatable is that in that performance curve on slide 8 continuing to move up and looking at how that is going forward?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Bob. Let me come back to a couple of points I made earlier and then I'll expand on that a little bit. But I hope you will understand we're not going to reveal sort of the full detailed recipe of how we're doing and what we're doing. But I'll say it starts with the tremendous technical database that we've developed. The team that we have there, really refining the multi-disciplined integration of that and the reservoir characterization, that allows us to then design a completion that takes advantage of the local characteristics.","Supplement that with the culture that we've been building over the last few years which is never to be satisfied with yesterday's results, and what it's taken us to is an approach that allows us to customize to a very sub-regional level. And if you'll look at our completion details across the basin, you'll very clearly see that we don't have a one size fits all approach, we custom design to take advantage of what we understand about local characteristics.","The Hector \u2013 record Three Forks well from Hector, the two West Myrmidon wells you mentioned, those records weren't delivered by accident. It's true that there was good rock to start with, but our completion designs were tailored to take advantage of the characteristics there. And so, it's a value optimization focus that drives it and a really refined multi-discipline integration of the large database that we have.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Obviously, that's working extremely well. Follow-up just quickly on the Cerny pilot. On the three Meramec wells there, was there already an unvented parent well on that section? And then also, did you see vertical communication between the Osage and the Woodford formations in that pilot?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Sure. The Cerny did have a parent well, and so just as a reminder, we drilled three additional Meramec wells across two landing zones in a half section there, and then we drilled one Osage well and one Woodford well. The solution out here as we've talked about several times is going to be, again, fairly regional and fairly specific down to the DSU level in some cases.","In this particular case, we did see some communication between Osage and Woodford but not between Meramec and those intervals. I wouldn't say that that result is necessarily translatable across long distances. We're going to need to do more multi-horizon tests to fully understand that and to optimize the solution.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I think you're pretty clear that the $2.3 billion budget looks like it's going to hold here almost regardless of the commodity environment. It's kind of back to the question on activity levels in the Eagle Ford and Bakken whether now or even into 2019. Are there constraints that you see to increasing activity relative to what your existing plans are from either ability to get things done, prospective inflation or just erosion of efficiency or productivity gains or do you view the decision to be fixed in the $2.3 billion in the areas you're at as purely a capital discipline choice decision?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Well, I certainly believe that the $2.3 billion is a capital discipline and returns-driven choice that we are making. There's nothing intrinsic in either basin that is limiting us today from an activity standpoint. Obviously, we look to drive maximum efficiency, i.e., running our frac crews 24\/7, et cetera. All of those things come into play. But when I \u2013 I think the way, again, to think about 2018 for both of those basins is Bakken is absolutely on a growth trajectory but is also going to generate free cash flow this year.","Eagle Ford, we are managing to a more or less flat production profile in order to take advantage of its capital efficiency and ability to generate free cash flow to drive other elements of our portfolio. I think on your question around, you mentioned inflation. Thus far, we feel that the inflation assumptions that were implicit in our original $2.3 billion plan are still holding true. And so we \u2013 although it's something that our teams not only look to manage, but actually look to offset each and every day we feel very comfortable at this stage that we have that accounted for fully in our $2.3 billion development capital budget.","2019 is something that we're really not talking about quite yet. But obviously, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, as well as our other basins will all be part of a multi-basin optimization as we go into 2019 and we'll allocate capital based on the best available data when we go through our planning cycle. So, nothing is locked in. There are no constraints around the Bakken and the Eagle Ford today that would not allow us to flex those assets up or down.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. My follow-up is with regards to Oklahoma. There's been some talk here about the STACK area. Any update of note or learnings or key milestones ahead on the SCOOP side of the equation?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Brian, this is Mitch again. I guess, we've got the remainder of 2018 focused on over pressured infills across STACK and then some infill down in the SCOOP area as well. And we've highlighted those I think on slide 11 if I recall.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. That's right.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Marathon Oil Corp.","And so, we will have some inflow of information with a couple infills down there but nothing to report today.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","And I think just as a reminder, Brian, because the SCOOP is clearly HBP'd, we have had the optionality to not necessarily drive activity there until we were ready to do so. But we will have some multi-well infill drilling there this year in 2018 and it will continue on, on that path.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","The next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Just one quick question, you talked about progressing and exiting Kurdistan. Can you provide an update there?","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. Absolutely. This is Lee, David. We are \u2013 we have \u2013 as a reminder, David, for everyone on line, we have two non-operated blocks in Kurdistan, Sarsang and Atrush. We have a small working interest in both of those. Sarsang, there is already an executed sales agreement in place and we are looking to again move that toward close. I would say that we continue to progress agreements around the Atrush block as well. So it is certainly reasonable to expect ultimately a full and complete exit from Kurdistan.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Cool. That's helpful. And then about your comments on the needed cash balance were pretty interesting and talk to the scale needed to really prosecute a development program in the multi-well development mode. Have you talked or thought about or talked about in the past the amount of capital needed from initial well spud to last well put on production. Just thinking about the amount of working capital that's getting put in the ground and that need, as you think about the next couple of years, by the STACK or the Delaware or the Bakken really?","Dane E. Whitehead - Marathon Oil Corp.","Yeah. David, this is Dane Whitehead. I spend a lot of time thinking about working capital. The way you frame that question is a little bit different to me, but let's take you back to the $750 million. I think within a given month and we kind of saw some of that this month, you can see an interim month working capital swing of north of $400 million, maybe up to $500 million, especially when commodity prices go up like they have, it really influences things.","And so, that's really kind of an important \u2013 a very important data point now we can calibrate that $750 million. Plus it's nice to have a little extra flexibility in there in the event a little bolt-on comes along or something like that.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","I would also maybe add, David, this is Lee, that the point you raised though around, as you get more toward multi-well pad drilling and as the number of wells on pad increases, these traditional kind of short cycle investments do start looking more like medium to long cycle investments and you need to plan that within your budget cycle and how you approach capital allocation.","And it also presents, I believe, even some forecasting challenges, particularly when you look at quarterly results because, clearly, if you have a large pad that moves out with the quarter, it can have dramatic results within the quarter, but not necessarily within the calendar year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","No, that's definitely the challenge of near-term versus intermediate- and longer-term perspective. And great results in the first quarter. Thanks for taking the question.","Lee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.","Thank you, Dave. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

My name is Vivian, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zach Dailey. Mr. Dailey, you may begin.","Zach Dailey - Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings and 2015 capital budget conference call. I'm Zach Dailey, Director of Investor Relations. Also joining me on the call this morning are: Lee Tillman, President and CEO; J.R. Sult, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mitch Little, Vice President, International and Offshore E&P Operations; and Lance Robertson, Vice President, North America Production Operations.","As has been our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in connection with the earnings release. You'll find those remarks and the associated slides on our website at MarathonOil.com.","We'll begin this morning with additional prepared remarks discussing our 2015 capital investment and exploration budget. We issued a separate press release detailing our 2015 capital program last evening, and we posted a second slide presentation to our website earlier today that accompanies this morning's prepared remarks. This morning's slide deck can be found under the Quarterly Earnings or Events tabs on the Investor Center page of our website and is titled 2015 Capital Budget slide deck. After our remarks, the remainder of the call will be available for Q&A. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","Slide two contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission cautionary language identifying important factors that are not necessarily all such factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil President and CEO, who will begin on slide three.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right, thank you, Zach, and good morning to all. I will say Zach is pinch-hitting for Chris Phillips today. He is a bit under the weather. We hope Chris is back with us soon.","As Zach mentioned, yesterday afternoon we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings as well as announcing our 2015 capital budget. What we really want to accomplish this morning is to spend the bulk of our time on the 2015 capital budget, and then turn to your questions. But before I do that, I'd like to share just a few thought on our full-year 2014 results.","I think I would summarize by saying we delivered against our 2014 performance commitments, investing in our three high-return U.S. resource plays, which yielded a 35% increase in production. We successfully closed on really two significant strategic dispositions of over $4 billion in proceeds. And we were also able to return value to our shareholders through an increased dividend and $1 billion in share repurchases.","We also had a proved reserve replacement ratio of 183% ex-dispositions, and that was at a very competitive $20 per barrel oil equivalent in finding and development cost. And we also recorded 97% operational availability across our company-operated assets. And of course, these are our most economic barrels.","I think we would say that by any measure, it was an outstanding year, but the second half of the year brought us a bit of a new reality, a bit of a gut check. Commodity prices corrected significantly downward, and I think we were harshly reminded yet again of our inability to predict pricing.","Our business plans for 2015, as with others, were being essentially adjusted in real time as the market continued to search for some semblance of stability. And in December, we felt it was critical to at least advise our shareholders as to our view of 2015 capital budget guidance at that particular point in time, with the caveat that we were prepared to respond to further downward movement in pricing. Our foreshadowing, unfortunately, was quite accurate, and prices fell more as we moved into the new year.","This morning what we're sharing is our updated plan and budget based on today's view of the pricing environment. But it has the same caveat that flexibility is going to be essential in a volatile commodity market. We will admit that we're no more clairvoyant on pricing than we were in December.","So with that little bit of a preamble, let me go and turn to 2015. Our $3.5 billion budget really emphasizes investment selectivity and returns, balance sheet flexibility, and positions us for price recovery. It is a further 20% reduction since our December update. We've significantly reduced exploration spending by half, and we are moderating activity levels in the U.S. in alignment with good cash flow management.","We'll end up directing about 70% or $2.4 billion of our budget toward our three core U.S. resource plays, and these continue to be among our highest return investment opportunities. Our objective is simple. It's to deliver high returns in the current pricing environment while we protect our financial flexibility through prudent management of cash flows.","Today we're also releasing updated single-well economics for the resource plays. And these new single-well economics reflect our 2015 inventory high-grading along with the service cost reductions that we've already captured and have in hand. Suffice to say, we are not opportunity limited.","Furthermore, we're continuing to pursue all means to expand our margins. We're going to do this through capital efficiency, expense management, and operational reliability, those things that we can control. Marathon Oil clearly benefits from a deep multiyear inventory that is robust across a broad range of pricing scenarios. Given this portfolio, we're fortunate to have the optionality to adjust our short-cycle investments in line with commodity prices.","As we continue to focus on our three high-quality U.S. resource plays in 2015, our budget and activity plans will support high-return investments that will in turn generate a total company production growth rate ex-Libya of 5% to 7% year over year; and specifically for our resource plays, a growth rate of about 20% year over year, admittedly benefiting from the 2014 carry-in effect. Bottom line is that we're going to be driven by returns and cash flow management with growth as an outcome while we retain the ability to flex on pricing.","With that, I'll turn over to Lance Robertson, our Vice President of North America Production Operations, and he'll take us through our activity plans for the resource plays. Lance?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Thanks, Lee. I'll begin on slide four. In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all three of the resource plays. Having the flexibility within our existing commercial agreements allows us to make these adjustments readily and at little to no cost.","As reflected by the table in the top right of the slide, activity will be reduced from 33 active rigs at the end of 2014 to 18 by the end of the first quarter, with a further reduction to 14 rigs by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate continuing at the 14 rig pace across the balance of 2015, but retain significant flexibility to scale up or down as market conditions warrant. In addition to rig reductions, we are optimizing completions activity to match our inventory of wells, with the focus on maintaining the execution efficiency of full frac fleets.","In addition to driving operational efficiencies, we have focused extensively on service cost reductions in this environment, securing to date a minimum of $225 million in savings across the 2015 activity. Importantly, substantially all of these initial savings were effective in January, benefiting our returns early in the cycle. We continue to see opportunity for additional savings throughout the year, further protecting our cash margins.","Our North America opportunities for investment remain compelling at current commodity pricing. Referencing the plot in the bottom right, our 2015 investments will focus on inventory that can deliver strong returns in each of Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Oklahoma resource basins. In addition, we have multiple years of inventory that can deliver similar returns at today's pricing.","With our core position in three key basins and our relentless focus on continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings, we can continue to provide Marathon Oil with opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. The 2015 development spend and activity in the resource basins will result in a production increase of approximately 20% year on year, with fourth quarter 2015 exit rates up from the same quarter of 2014.","Turning to slide five, we will focus initially on the Eagle Ford, where we have allocated approximately 40% of total 2015 capital on our high-return inventory. Our quality core acreage provides opportunity to drive tremendous value at this scale. We continue to realize this value through highly effective execution. With these efficiencies and recently secured service cost reductions, our costs have fallen by $1.3 million a well to an average of $6.3 million a well in 2015, maintaining our position as one of the most cost efficient operators in the basin.","Over the past year, completions optimization has resulted in a 25% increase in 180-day cumulative production across wells to sales. This incremental early-life production materially improves well margins. And as this group matures, we anticipate adding further value with an increase in ultimate volumes recovered.","Taking into account cost savings and improvements in well performance, we anticipate drilling approximately 215 to 225 wells this year in South Texas, with returns ranging from 40% to 60% at $60 flat WTI pricing. This group includes Eagle Ford condensate wells, high-GOR Eagle Ford oil wells, with the remaining 25% of wells to develop and further delineate the Austin Chalk. In all cases, the Austin Chalk is co-developed with the Lower Eagle Ford, leveraging the existing gathering network and the facilities.","Focusing on the table in the upper left, we are illustrating for the first time single-well metrics for the Austin Chalk. From the data, you can see that the initial production and estimated ultimate recovery compare favorably to the Eagle Ford condensate and high-GOR oil wells. In the currently delineated core area, the Austin Chalk wells deliver the highest returns, driven by higher early-life cumulative production relative to other horizons in the Eagle Ford portfolio.","Continuing with our co-development efforts, the first four Upper Eagle Ford wells were placed on sales in the fourth quarter. They're co-developed above high-GOR Lower Eagle Ford oil wells in this pilot, consistent with the Austin Chalk co-development efforts. Same-zone spacing is 40-acre equivalent, with spacing between the horizons at 20-acre equivalent. These wells are early on flow, but initial rates and pressures are encouraging from both horizons. We will continue this testing throughout the year, much in the way the Austin Chalk has been and will continue to be identified, evaluated, and developed.","In addition, we also spud the first Stack and Frac co-development pilot in the fourth quarter, including Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, and two wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. We will provide an update on these efforts later in the year.","Focusing on the Bakken on slide six, the initial completion trials are mostly finished, with 42 of the wells completed and flowing to sales. Of these wells, the first 18 in Myrmidon and Hector have yielded a more than 30% increase in cumulative production over the first 60 days. This material change in early production is clearly very encouraging, and we anticipate further updates as the production histories mature.","In aggregate, the incremental spend on more intensive completions is yielding a return on investment at or above 100% in all areas and zones. As a result of strong early production response and our focus on driving value, we have adopted the updated completion practices with more intensive stimulations into the base program. These changes are effective across Myrmidon and Hector and Middle Bakken and Three Forks intervals. Reflecting the success, we will continue to test and optimize completions moving forward.","Directing your attention to the single-well returns table in the upper left of the slide, we illustrated updated gross completed well costs of $6.2 million to $6.6 million a well, reflecting a reduction of almost $1 million a well thus far. These costs include incremental spend for more intensive stimulations for each area. But the full performance benefits of enhanced completions on EUR is not yet reflected.","In addition to the completion pilots, we have concluded drilling on the first two spacing pilots with six wells per horizon in Hector and Myrmidon. These pilots will move to completions over the coming weeks, with a third spacing pilot currently drilling. We anticipate a combination of improved stimulation designs coupled with increasing spacing density to drive toward the highest value, incrementally improving the recovery efficiency across a drilling unit.","With improved well costs and higher initial production, our investments in the Williston Basin will deliver competitive returns at 20% to 30% in the current commodity environment. As we continue to focus on highest returns and value, the majority of our activity in 2015 will occur in the Myrmidon area.","On slide seven, Oklahoma resource activity will focus on protecting core leasehold in the SCOOP and STACK areas. With more than 70% of our Oklahoma acreage held by production, our 2015 activity will allow us to manage lease expiries with moderated spend of approximately $225 million and two rigs after the first quarter.","Our focus for the year will include high-value SCOOP and STACK wells, including our first operated spacing pilot in the SCOOP-Woodford, where we are targeting six wells in a 640-acre unit, effectively testing same-zone spacing of approximately 105 acres. This spacing pilot was spud in the fourth quarter. We anticipate moving to completions by the middle of 2015.","In addition, we will spud our first operated Springer well in the SCOOP area later in the year to complement the 17 outside operated Springer wells in which we currently participate. We continue to grow our leaseholds in Oklahoma, adding 10,000 net acres focused on the SCOOP and Springer areas in the fourth quarter.","Drawing your attention to the table on the upper left, SCOOP well estimated ultimate recoveries continue to be among the highest available with a high liquids content. Having secured an initial cost reduction of more than $0.5 million, we are confident we can deliver wells with 30% to 40% internal rates of return in the current commodity market. With the lower activity in Oklahoma, we will turn our focus to developing the spacing pilots, driving efficiency, securing additional cost reductions, and delivering higher ultimate value.","With the longest wells from spud to total depth in our resource portfolio today, we see ample opportunity for cycle time improvements in 2015. And with price recovery, we'll be ready to move to scale at the lowest cost.","Slide eight brings together all three U.S. resource plays and demonstrates the strength of our resource and inventory. Our 2015 capital development program is one that's appropriately scaled to today's commodity price environment. As Lee mentioned at the beginning, we expect these basins to achieve an approximate 20% increase in production 2015 over 2014, taking into account our spending plans and moderated activity levels.","Next, I'll hand it off to my counterpart, Mitch Little, Vice President of International and Offshore E&P Operations. Mitch will describe 2015 activity for his business.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","Thank you, Lance. Switching now to our international and offshore activities, which begin on slide nine, our 2015 development activities are focused on high-return previously sanctioned long-cycle commitments and selective other projects that offer superior risk-adjusted returns, including targeted activities in Equatorial Guinea, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the UK North Sea.","Within EG, we're progressing the Alba B3 Compression project, which has important infrastructure, allowing us to access the field's proven reserve base by significantly lowering field abandonment pressure. The project is approximately 60% complete, remains within budget and on track for a 2016 startup. Combined with the addition of the C-21 infill producer, the project is expected to maintain field production plateau for an additional two years while extending field life by as much as eight years.","Our investment activities in EG also include a second near-field wildcat well, testing an oil prone amplitude supported prospect at Rodo, which is located within sub-area B of the Alba block. While the recently drilled Sodalita West well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbon quantities, we were encouraged by the presence of high-quality oil in multiple stacked sands. Our upcoming Rodo well is targeting a younger reservoir section, and we have several additional prospects across our more than 120,000 net acres under contract in EG.","Our UK investment program is concentrated on the addition of three infill producers that add high-return incremental barrels to our existing operations. The first well, an infill producer at South Brae, will be online within the first quarter and follows on the success of two previous wells that were brought online in late 2014 and continue to outperform pre-drill expectations. Activities also include drilling and completion of two subsea infill producers within our operated West Brae field. The first of these wells is expected to be online by the end of February, with the second coming online around midyear.","Moving on to our planned 2015 Kurdistan investment program, which includes the development activities highlighted here as well as exploration activities, which will be discussed on the subsequent slide; within the outside operated Atrush Block, construction and installation of the Phase 1 production facilities continues, with first production currently forecast for late 2015. Appraisal and testing activities also continue in the eastern portions of the field. And results from those activities will be integrated with existing data to inform a future decision regarding the applicability of additional development phases.","The outside operated Sarsang Block is currently producing around 4,000 gross barrels of oil a day from a single well facility within the Swara Tika field. A phased field development plan is under review within the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources, and we anticipate approval and associated development activities in 2015.","Finally, in the Gulf of Mexico, we are participating in the two-well subsea development project at the outside operated Gunflint, with first production expected in 2016.","Moving now to slide 10, we have materially reduced our global exploration spending in 2015, with activities focused towards ongoing appraisal activities and\/or prior commitments. The majority of this spending is tightly focused within two geographic areas.","Within the Gulf of Mexico, we continue evaluation and testing of our prospect inventory within the inboard Paleogene play. Several discoveries have been announced within the play over the past few years, including the outside operated Shenandoah field, where Marathon Oil holds a 10% working interest. An appraisal well is expected to spud at Shenandoah in the second quarter. Additionally, the Maersk Valiant drillship will be back for our second operated well slot sometime during the second quarter of 2015.","Moving over to Kurdistan, we are currently drilling the Mirawa 2 appraisal well within the company operated Harir Block. The well is a follow-up to the 2013 Mirawa discovery well and will further define the resource base in advance of a commerciality decision, which is due later this year. In addition, within the outside operated Sarsang Block, the East Swara Tika exploration well is currently being sidetracked to an updip location. Well results are expected to be announced later in 2015.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Lee for his concluding comments.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right, thank you, Mitch, and thank you to Lance as well. As our budget and activity plans demonstrate, Marathon Oil is focused on delivering long-term shareholder value regardless of the commodity price cycle. We have a keen eye on returns and financial flexibility. We're committed to exercising capital discipline that will protect our optionality and position us to be a stronger E&P, and not only 2015 and 2016 but beyond.","Our three U.S. resource plays have exceptional sub-surface quality and strong single-well economics that will deliver solid returns across a broad range of price scenarios. Even after high-grading our opportunities for this low price environment, our deep portfolio affords us a multiyear drilling inventory, with pace and spending levels ultimately moderated based on pricing and cash flows.","We are exercising every means available to expand our margins, including significant contributions that you've heard about from enhanced completions and service cost reductions. But we're also mindful of driving the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity which must match the current environment and activity levels, and finally, operational reliability. Our commitment to our previously stated seven strategic imperatives is durable regardless of the commodity cycle.","Though we're rightly focused on prudent near-term actions, we've laid the groundwork for the future, and we'll continue building on our resource base. In 2015, our asset teams will be aggressively testing co-development, Stack and Frac, downspacing, enhanced completion designs, and new horizons, all strategic opportunities to expand our unconventional resource for the future.","We are well prepared for the current low-price environment, and our 2015 investment program is based on achieving the highest returns at today's commodity prices while prudently managing cash flows. We will also continue to protect optionality to flex our spend up or down, and we'll ensure that our outstanding asset teams are prepared to take full advantage of a sustained recovery.","That really concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, we'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on the operational performance last year, and thanks for a lot of color in the presentations. I guess a question on the 2015 and then 2016 shale growth. You mentioned that you have inventory and you can see it in the numbers if you look at well completions and then wells to sales, which obviously four less. As you roll forward into 2016, if you just kept the same level of activity, what sort of production growth do you think you'd get from each of your plays? It feels like it should flatten and then perhaps even decline if we carried on at this level of well completions.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Let me address that one, Ed. First, maybe it's useful for us just to reflect on how we developed this year's plan. And it was really looking at the near-term pricing environment, the returns that we could generate, high-grading the inventory, and then testing that against our cash flow management objectives. And really, when we did that, growth became an outcome, if you will, from that process. And we tested that, of course, against numerous pricing scenarios.","If we look at 2015, as we stated in the prepared material, Ed, we're looking at overall growth on average of 5% to 7% for the portfolio. But we also believe the resource plays will deliver approximately 20% in growth. If we think about that in terms of exit rates, the exit rates 4Q 2014 to 4Q 2015 and the resource plays will actually be up, and the overall portfolio will essentially be flat on exit rate with the resource plays, essentially offsetting our more mature properties.","Looking forward into 2016, as you might imagine, Ed, we've run numerous scenarios looking at not only 2015 but also 2016 under many, many price decks over the last few months. But when we think about 2106 and we think about a moderate level of recovery in 2016, we think that we could hold our budget essentially at current levels, 2015 type levels around the $3.5 billion, and keep our overall average for the portfolio essentially flat, with likely exit rates increasing a bit year on year as we see a little bit more activity because we're seeing some improvement in cash flows.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's very helpful and probably more guidance than we'll get from other companies at this stage, so thank you. And then on the cost side, $225 million across your budget, I mean that's sort of 5%, 6%. People are thinking service cost deflation is going to 20% or more. I'm just worried if you \u2013 I'm sorry, I'd like to ask whether you think 20% is realistic. Or is it just a function of where you are in the year?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure, Ed, good question. I think I would encourage everyone to think of that initial cost savings of $225 million as the minimum. Those are effectively savings we've already accomplished. They're in the rearview mirror from our perspective, and we're working on the next level. We've built those into our budget plans, so they're included in there. We're already working on several areas of next cost savings. So we fully anticipate that savings to grow throughout the year. We're confident in what we've already achieved and we're confident we'll achieve further savings throughout the year, Ed.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, everybody. Lee, thanks for all the guidance and the detailed review on the capital budget. But I guess my question is one of your competitors this morning is also a very large operator in the Eagle Ford. They've just come out and basically said you know what, we're just not going to give this stuff away in this oil price environment, especially when we haven't had the costs come down yet. And if I read your interpretation correctly, what you're basically saying is we're going to try and get the best returns in the current oil price environment. Why complete the wells at all when you haven't had the cost reductions to the scale that most people are expecting? And I think by your own words, you anticipate that the oil price will ultimately recover. So why not store it in the ground as opposed to just keep on going at this stage? And I've got a follow-up question.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay yes, I'll address that one, Doug. First of all, we feel very confident that, as Lance has already stated, that we have already captured significant cost savings. So we're not sitting here waiting to capture cost savings. We've already got cost savings in the bank essentially back through the January timeframe. So we feel very comfortable that we are already on that path of capturing cost reduction. We also continue of course to improve the overall productivity of the wells. And when you look at the returns that we're able to generate, we feel very confident that the shareholder is benefiting from those investments.","I will say though that we are optimizing our completion program, though. We're not simply just driving forward with our backlog of inventory. As Lance mentioned, we're going to be very judicious about pacing our completion activity in 2015 to ensure that we one, capture full cost reduction savings at scale, but two, also capture the executions efficiency of running full frac crews. So my answer would be is we feel very confident in the returns that we're generating. That's a little bit of a bet on the future I guess in terms of what you see the contango in the future. But we're very comfortable with our investment program.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I appreciate what's obviously not an easy answer. But I guess in a similar vein, you are quite different from your peers in terms of your dividend \u2013 in terms of the scale of the dividend in this oil price environment. And I guess given \u2013 I guess there's some debate over whether or not you get paid or recognized in your share price for the dividend that you pay. I just wonder if you could help us prioritize your relative expectations for how you allocate cash and maybe perhaps the level of cash flow that you anticipate in your current budget, including dividend spend. And I'll leave it at that, thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay, well let me maybe address the dividend question. And perhaps I'll ask J.R. to comment a little bit on cash flows and out spend because I know that's a topic of interest. We are committed to our dividend. When we talk about how we allocate capital, we look at the buckets to which we allocate capital. Our financial obligations, which in our view include the dividend, are at the top of that list. And we've always said that we'll scale any movement in the dividend according to the health of the business. But I want to be very clear that we remain committed to our dividends. It's the way that we return value to our shareholders. It needs to be looked at in the full context of the dividend plus the organic growth that we're generating in our business. With that, maybe I'll just ask J.R. to comment a bit on cash flows and our view of out spend moving forward.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, thanks, Lee. Doug, good to hear from you this morning. I think Lee has indicated earlier today, I mean we really did design the capital budget to reflect the spend that we believe is appropriate even in the current environment. And it was really approached quite carefully to balance between this ongoing capital investment and what we believe are attractive returns in our U.S. unconventional resources, and high returns quite candidly, with our ability and our commitment to continue to maintain appropriate financial flexibility during this timeframe.","I think also, let's keep in mind. I am sitting on nearly $5 billion of liquidity today, and I think that puts us in a good position as we start into 2015. But honestly that said, we're going to continue to monitor our level of cash flows based on not only the current price environment but expectations in the later part of 2015 and 2016 and look at our cash flow profile accordingly to make sure that we're maintaining that flexibility. And if conditions change, we've got a great deal of flexibility to either decrease if they get worse, or equally important, to increase if we see a strengthening environment, our level of capital spend to really match that increase in cash flows as well.","So, and then finally I'd say, Doug, I think Lee highlighted pretty well that we're going to continue to address those matters. They're really within our control of the business, operating costs, G&A, and those sorts of matters. So at this point in point, there's no doubt that we are investing a significant portion of our Norway proceeds this year. But we think we're investing them in an organic program that's delivering solid returns for our shareholders.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, guys, thanks very much indeed.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks and good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow up a little bit on that last point, you're maintaining an attractive level of momentum operationally, and you'll still have on the balance sheet lots of dry powder again in 2015. If you think about that cash management going forward, what would you need to see to put money and rigs back to work? Is it a certain level on the oil price? Is it the cash flow relative to the spending outlook? Is it securing a level of cost reduction? What puts money and rigs back to work?","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think, Ryan, the answer to that is probably a bit multi-dimensional. First, it starts with seeing I think a sustained recovery in pricing, one with certainly less volatility but also yields us enhanced cash flows that we can redeploy into the business. Again, we've stated we're not opportunity constrained. That's obvious from our single-well economics and our inventory. So as that incremental cash flow becomes available, we would certainly be looking to invest more.","And in our current plans, again, we're not just looking at 2015. We are looking at 2016 and beyond. And in 2016, we are assuming a moderate recovery in pricing that we think will support some uplift in activity going forward, and we're well prepared to do that. We have the execution capacity to gear up or down in the resource plays quite readily.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks, and then maybe one other on the opportunity set going forward. In recent years you've been a big \u2013 you've been a large seller of assets with the exception of maybe building a bit of position in the SCOOP and STACK area. When you think about that going forward, are you still \u2013 do you see yourselves more likely still trying to rationalize the portfolio a little bit, or would you look to be more opportunistic in deploying your balance sheet going forward?","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Let me first maybe, Ryan, address the portfolio management question. Portfolio management for us is an evergreen process. It's just part of what a healthy E&P company does. We're going to continually test our asset set to ensure that it competes for capital allocation within our portfolio. So you're going to see portfolio management feature in our business model going forward in time. Now let's be honest, it's a tough market right now to go out and dispose of an asset and capture true value for the shareholder, but we're going to continue to test the market when we think that it make sense for the shareholder.","Back on your other question, though, more maybe along the lines of the M&A, the acquisitive side, I would maybe characterize it. Though it's not a focus for us today, when you think about the bid\/ask spread, it's still out there. There's probably still a bit of a gap. But anything that we would evaluate has to compete against our already very strong organic inventory. It would have to come in and compete for capital allocation, which in our view is a relatively high bar from a quality and scale standpoint. So that would be I think the limiting factor to it. It's really finding that quality of asset.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Hi, three unrelated ones. With the cost savings, is it just discount from book, or changes in procurement as well as efficiencies in well designs, things like that?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","John, it's actually a number of things, all of which you included and more. So there is efficiency savings in there we've realized over the last quarter that we're reflecting in those updated single-well metrics tables. We certainly have gone out and renegotiated our contracts, in some cases taken on new contracts or negotiated new pricing within existing structures reflecting the market and taken every means necessary in that.","I think we look at that and I'd say we look at the context of those single-well metrics on slide 13, and we feel confident. We're confident enough on those savings that we've already reflected new cost per well in those tables. And we think that's the beginning of the minimum for this year, and we anticipate additional savings. And it isn't clear what the ultimate savings will be throughout the year. We think it's more than we've already achieved. But we wanted to achieve those early in the cycle so we can continue to invest with confidence, and we are. But I also think those well costs we're reflecting are very competitive in each of those basins.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","No, I agree. I just thought you might get more cost savings going forward. Next question for me is on the Stack and Frac. From the time you spud your initial well to the time you complete the formations, about how long is that in duration?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","John, it depends on how big the pad size is. So it can vary from as little as 90 days. It could be 120 days. And in this case, the Stack and Frac is going to have four zones vertically, two in the Lower Eagle Ford, one in the Upper Eagle Ford, and then the Austin Chalk. Generally, those pilots may even be larger than that. It may be seven or eight wells as we expand that horizontally, but it's that same vertical stacking. So it's diverse in time depending on how many are on the pad, quite frankly.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay, that's fine. Last one for me is on Oklahoma, any acreage retention issues at all?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","No, I think we're quite confident. We have 70% of our total acreage HBP today, John. And then reflecting those lease expiries over the next several years, not just this year, we can maintain those leases with about two rigs moving forward. Ideally, we'd like to see in a commodity price recovery more activity so we can test other things. But we're confident we can retain all of the value of that lease position within the business plan we've presented.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great, thank you.","Zach Dailey - Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, John.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","I had a follow-up on the comment that the unconventional production is expected to rise exit rate 2015 versus exit rate 2014, which is different than what we've heard from others in the industry who are cutting capital to a similar degree. So I was just hoping to better understand A little bit more specifically how you think you're driving that. And if there's anything that you would point out, maybe differentiated production expectations from one basin to another, or just if you had any other comments on that front. And then I had a follow-up as well.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure, Guy. Maybe I'll just talk generically a bit about the resource plays. I think the reason that again we're able to be very capital efficient in 2015 is again several-fold. One, we've had the ability to high-grade our inventory even within our extremely strong core areas. So you got a high-grading effect where you're bringing the best opportunities forward, not only with a basin, but across all three basins.","Secondly, we're able to do that at lower cost for the reasons that Lance has already enumerated. We've captured those early cost savings very early in the cycle, and certainly we're chasing even more throughout the year. And then, as the asset teams continue to drive things like enhanced completion performance as well as some of the co-development work, the downspacing work, all of those are tending to improve the overall productivity of the wells also. So it's lifting all boats, if I can put it that way. So when you consider all those factors, I think it positions us very, very strongly to continue to drive that kind of exit rate to exit rate growth.","Now again, we are still benefiting from some pretty strong carry-in effects from 2014 as well. But as we look across the year and optimize our completion program, we're going to be able to again keep that production relatively steady throughout the year with again a little bit of uptick in the exit rates for 2015.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks, that's helpful. And then my follow-up was on exploration. You made obviously very significant cuts to the capital allocated there. I was hoping to get some strategic commentary on that front. Does that reflect a permanent shift in the exploration strategy going forward, or is it more of a specific adjustment you're making this year to better balance cash flow? I'm just trying to better understand whether for exploration we creep back towards $500 million a year to $600 million a year. I just wanted to get the latest thoughts on how that has evolved as you've tested out some of the new acreage you've been building up over the last few years.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Great question. Exploration remains attractive to us for obvious reasons because of the strong multiples that it can generate, again, when we're successful at exploration. To be very frank, we are not satisfied with our historical performance in exploration. And under Mitch's leadership, we feel a need to improve in that area. And while we're searching for the enhanced approach that will drive those improved results, we are reducing spend materially. A lot of that reduction though, Guy, quite frankly, was in place on an activity basis before the commodity price correction though. So it was largely driven by, I would say, scheduling and commitments that we had in the 2015 time period.","I would end just by saying that exploration must compete for capital allocation, like every other aspect of our business. And so this year, yes, the spend will be materially reduced. And as we look forward in time, opportunities in exploration will have to go head to head with the other investment opportunities we have in our portfolio.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for the comments.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'm trying to think about future potential cost savings. On the $225 million factored in so far, is there a breakout you have in terms of North America versus international? If it's primarily U.S. resource plays, it implied closer to 8% to 9% in cost savings. Is that the right way to think about it, or is it more of a balanced split?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","It's a great question, Jeff. I would say that $225 million is specific to North America and really specific to the three resource plays underneath it. And so it's built into the development costs we've already captured today, primarily in Oklahoma, Bakken, and Eagle Ford. So I think the way you're describing it is accurate if it's on that, and that's our minimum floor. We expect that to grow materially over the balance of the year.","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","Jeoffrey, this is Mitch Little. I'll just add a little bit to that from the international and offshore side. We are seeing some modest reductions across a number of suppliers. We've got specific plans in place at each asset. But keep in mind that a lot of the projects we're executing in that space are long-cycle prior commitments, executed long-cycle contracts, which aren't going to be subject to the same volatility as we are seeing in the North American onshore business.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great, and then last question for me. In regards to ongoing optimization on completions, how do you view that pilot testing going forward for increased proppant loading, additional completion changes, just given lower commodity prices and the incremental capital required up front there?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","I think you'll see us continue, Jeff, with completions optimizations on an ongoing basis effectively indefinitely. We're always going to look for that better well productivity at the lowest cost possible, particularly as we look at Bakken and Oklahoma, where we have lower activity for the year. We see this as a great opportunity to drive well productivity as well as test spacing so that as prices do recover in the future, we're very well positioned to grow to full field development scale quickly and at the highest value for the company. I think we're confident we'll continue to see improvements on that. And working in all three of those basins and any new basins in the future on optimization is just going to be a natural cycle of our business.","Jeoffrey Lambujon - Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Jeoffrey.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You've always talked about share buyback as a flex variable. And I suppose now that you've cut CapEx by 40%, if oil prices were to recover, what's going to be the decision variables between allocating increased CapEx versus perhaps resuming buyback?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes Pavel, this is J.R. I think that's a fair question. We talked a lot about how share buybacks have got to compete against organic capital reinvestments, and I think we demonstrated that in 2014. You recall back when we sold Angola, the thought process was what was that next best highest use of capital. And at that point in time, it's a little bit of history, we had just significantly ramped up activity across North America. And at that point in time, we were not ready to make that next incremental investment in North America given our desire to see us operating at that higher scale. So really, the next highest and best use from an allocation standpoint was share repurchases.","Now fast-forward. Not only do we find ourselves in this volatile commodity price environment, but we find ourselves with a level of capital spend that really isn't funding a large portion of our organic investment opportunities that are still high earning. So it is a much different conversation regarding what is the risk-adjusted return of that organic reinvestment versus the share repurchases.","But I got to tell you, Pavel, I mean until we see a bit more clarity around the depth and duration of the commodity price correction that we're in right now, I feel like the balance sheet is probably the best place for any incremental capital at this point in time until we see a strengthening of cash flows. But again, at the appropriate time, share repurchases is going to be a consideration for capital allocation. It's just going to have to continue to compete on a risk-adjusted basis.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, and then just a small housekeeping item about the production guidance. Are you giving credit to any volumes this year from your first development in Kurdistan?","Thomas Mitchell Little - Vice President-International Production Operations","As I mentioned in my comments, we are currently forecasting first production from the Atrush non-operated Phase 1 block late this year. We also have very small production from the Sarsang Block, which is about 4,000 gross barrels of oil a day.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","A very small number.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, understood. Thanks very much, guys.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Pavel.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Pavel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes thanks very much. I just wanted to come back to J.R.'s comment about the balance sheet. Do you have any, as you think about capital allocations, upper limits on let's say, a leverage ratio that you'd be willing to go to if we have continued low prices, net debt-to-cap ratio, something along those lines?","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Jason, I think that's a fair question and one that I've always tried to maintain the most flexibility and not necessarily commit myself to a ceiling. But that said, first and foremost, I want to make sure it's clear that we are committed to maintaining that strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to keep that commitment throughout this commodity price cycle.","I think I said earlier or at least today, we got nearly \u2013 or at year end we've got nearly $5 billion of liquidity and $2.4 billion of that in cash. And the way I look at our investment-grade rating, and I think it's a solid investment-grade rating, is it does reflect one that we would expect to maintain throughout this commodity price cycle. And so I think the rating agencies have always historically rated our sector based on a through the commodity price cycle approach and not just on the environment that they're in.","And finally I'd say, as I think as we've done that, Jason, we've taken that into consideration in designing the 2015 capital program that does reflect that balance between the need to continue the ongoing investment at high returns while at the same time maintaining that balance sheet. That said, and I think I mentioned it earlier, we're going to continue to watch the current environment and ensure that our capital profile and our operating cash flow profile are appropriately taken into consideration depending on that environment.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Got it, thanks. That's helpful actually. One more if I could, please, and I apologize if this is a bit in the weeds. But this is the first time I've really seen the data on the Austin Chalk type curves. I'm trying to understand how it's giving a better IRR than an Eagle Ford condensate well given that the IP is lower, the EUR is lower, and the completed well cost is higher, but it's about the same level of liquids production.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Sure, Jason, great question. So I would encourage everybody to think that the IP of a Lower Eagle Ford well and an Austin Chalk well are similar, with the Lower Eagle Ford being a little bit better. But what really happens is really by the third month, those two have equalized, and then the Austin Chalk well declines at a little bit slower rate. So when you look toward, say, 180-day cumulative production, the Austin Chalk is just higher than the Lower Eagle Ford well. And it's that early-life production, particularly the first and second year, that drives the value by bringing forward the cash flows from those extra barrels.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay, that's perfect. That's really helpful.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","And as a result, you see those attractive return metrics for the Eagle Ford.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes Jason, I think you also highlighted something that I think is important. This is the first time, as Lance said in his prepared remarks, that we've actually shown standalone single-well economics for the Austin Chalk. So I appreciate you pointing that out on the call.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Would you be able to share what the first year decline is on the Austin Chalk relative to the Eagle Ford condensate?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Jason, I don't know that I actually scrutinized them in that detail. I think the Eagle Ford range is depending on type curve from 70% to 78%. And it's just a few percent lower, but those incremental barrels make a difference in the Austin Chalk. I do think I'd like to reiterate, we've said several times before, we could only afford to co-develop Austin Chalk if it would compete favorably in economics. And so we're quite pleased to be able to show these and demonstrate that co-developing those horizons is the right choice today because they have very favorable returns together.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Got it. Thanks for the comments, guys.","John R. Sult - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I'd like to go back to the cost reductions and just ask a little bit different question. One concern that I think people are talking about is that when oil prices recover, D&C costs are going to rise again as well. So I'm wondering how sticky can margin enhancement based on cost reduction remain?","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Jeff, it's a good question. I think first and foremost, in the current market, our focus is with margins compressed by lower commodity prices, it's incumbent upon us to be aggressive in pushing those service costs and tangible goods costs down so that we protect our margins in our short-cycle investments as early as possible. I think \u2013 I hope we've demonstrated that we're doing that, and it will be up to us to do it.","I think even as commodity prices rise, you will see pressure on those. We will obviously work to defend those to the extent we can and push on that. It's not all just cost savings though. We continue to focus on cycle time reductions and efficiencies. And so the efficiencies we can achieve in the market, those will be very sticky and stay with us on a perpetuity basis. Obviously, just like commodity pricing, we will have to some extent less control over service costs.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Jeffrey, maybe I will just add too that we have to look at those elements of our cost structure too that will be durable irrespective of where the pricing environment. And I mentioned a few of the things that we can pursue, and we're looking at every means available to us. An obvious one for us is with our response to the commodity prices and the commensurate, I would say, reduction in activity. We're taking, of course, a hard look at our organizational capacity. And of course, on that front we're in the midst of implementing a reduction in organizational capacity that's going to take some 350 to 400 positions out of our cost structure going forward. So I want to make it very clear that we're doing the things necessary to put in place cost reduction initiatives that will be durable throughout the cycle.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Got it, that's very helpful. Thank you. Some of your peers say that the Springer shale produces the best returns in the Oklahoma resource plays. You have a lot of non-op data, but you appear to be moving into operated Springer drilling at a deliberate pace. I'm just wondering what your forward view is on the Springer, and that can be both 2015 and beyond.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Jeff, we also see the Springer as potentially very valuable, maybe among the most valuable investments we could make in Oklahoma. We have planned to be more active, quite frankly, in 2015 in the Springer, to test it earlier. As we've gone through the cycle and looked to prune our activity is we've reduced our forecast activity in Oklahoma. And as a result and our need to make sure we're maintaining our very valuable SCOOP and STACK leases in the area, we found it necessary to start our own operated Springer activity later in the year than possible.","That does not reflect a lack of confidence on our part. It really reflects some constraints on the amount of activity we'll have in Oklahoma during the year. By way of having a diverse and large portfolio, particularly in the SCOOP area, which is overlain by the Springer, we've had the benefit of participating and I think nearly three-quarters of all Springer wells drilled to date. So we do have a lot of data and we're advancing our understanding of the reservoir performance early. But of course, we're excited to get our own operated activity later this year.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. If I could ask just one last quick one, where are the current and future Upper Eagle Ford locations relative to Lower Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk? And really, what I'm thinking of is this slide five that talks about the Stack and Frac.","Lance W. Robertson - Vice President-North America Production Operations","Right now we're early in the Upper Eagle Ford and the Stack and Frac. We're really bringing on our first pilot group for the Upper Eagle Ford. And so I'd start with that group. We have some places where we've delineated Austin Chalk. And in some of those areas, we recognize that the reservoir quality in the Upper Eagle Ford may actually be superior to the Austin Chalk. And so we may develop the Upper Eagle Ford and the Lower Eagle Ford together, and so we're testing that now. And it will be some time before we understand the delineated area.","And then on the Stack and Frac, we have some areas within our acreage where we see a very prospective Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, and Lower Eagle Ford, and that's about us testing all three of those together. And in some cases, we'll actually have two wells in the Lower Eagle Ford like this first pilot. Again, with that first one drilling and not on completions, I think we have an idea of where that performance is. But it's early days, and we need to see that performance before we can talk about how delineated it can be.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That was so very helpful. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Lee M. Tillman - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Zach Dailey.","Zach Dailey - Director, Investor Relations","Thanks. I'd like to thank everyone again for their participation this morning. Please contact me if you have any additional follow-up questions. In conclusion, Marathon Oil is well prepared for the current low price environment, with the 2015 capital program focused on our highest return investment opportunities and prudent management of cash flows. Combined with maintaining financial flexibility, we're positioning the company to be a stronger E&P in the future. THIS concludes today's call.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
