Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.","T. Peter Andrew - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including business plans and strategies, industry trends, and business and financial outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and we assume no obligation to update them to reflect new information or events.","Please refer to our most recent annual financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and Guidance Summary that are being posted in the Investor Relations sections of our website. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question.","Before I pass the line to Steve, I want to alert everyone that, in an effort to provide investors greater transparency into our business and make our earnings-related information easier to find, we've made a number of significant changes to the information in the earnings-related materials posted on our website.","All of these materials can be found in the Investor Relations sections of our website under Quarterly Results and Earnings Documents. Please take a few minutes to check out this new material and we look forward to hearing your feedback.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter financials and wrap up with our second quarter guidance. We will then take your questions.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported revenue of $5 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 38%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at the year-ago level and, with the help of a capital structure that has significantly reduced interest expense, we delivered $3.04 in non-GAAP earnings per share and over $700 million in operating cash flow during the quarter.","While our first quarter results were impacted by declines in flash average selling prices, we experienced strong performance in capacity enterprise, surveillance hard drives, and embedded flash solutions, with each growing revenue over 30% on a year-over-year basis.","Current geopolitical and industry dynamics are creating a more challenging global business environment. For example, trade tensions with China, changes in monetary policy, foreign exchange volatility and the corresponding economic impacts are causing our customers to be more conservative resulting in a demand slowdown for our products.","This softening demand, in combination with increased flash supply, has led to a market imbalance resulting in a deteriorating near-term flash pricing environment. In response to these conditions, we are making an immediate reduction to wafer starts and delaying deployment of capital equipment. These actions will reduce our wafer output beginning in fiscal Q3 2019. The goal of these actions is to better align our output with the projected global demand for flash. The duration of the planned output reduction will depend upon market conditions and will not impact our ability to meet customer commitments nor will it impede our ability to deliver the most innovative and cost-competitive solutions to the market.","Longer term, we remain focused on technology leadership, the broadening of our product portfolio and continued operational improvements. Highlights of our recent successes in these areas include: leadership in bringing the highest capacity and lowest total cost of ownership solutions to cloud customers with our recently introduced 15-terabyte SMR-based hard drive, successful introduction on 96-layer BiCS4 solutions, including our latest SATA-based client SSD and the industry's first UFS 2.1 embedded flash drive for high-end smartphones, ongoing growth in data center systems and industry accolades for our ActiveScale object storage systems \u2013 Gartner has recognized ActiveScale as a challenger in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant \u2013 and operational improvements that include the rightsizing of our hard drive manufacturing footprint.","We remain well positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunities associated with the rapid growth in the volume and value of data. I want to thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support. We look forward to hosting our 2018 Investor Day on December 4 to provide further insight about our plans to deliver long-term shareholder value through ongoing growth and leadership in today's data-driven world.","With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we are taking aggressive actions to align our supply of flash to current end market demand. I'd like to provide some additional insight into our actions announced today.","Our immediate reduction in wafer starts and delayed deployment of capital equipment is a reflection of the adjustment to bit supply growth needed to improve the supply-demand dynamic by midyear 2019. The magnitude of these actions is a reduction of 10% to 15% of our planned bit output in calendar year 2019.","With these adjustments to our supply, we expect our bit growth in calendar year 2019 to be in line with our view of end market demand growth of between 36% to 38%. We will continue to monitor market conditions and make additional adjustments either up or down as the situation dictates.","As we enter the second fiscal quarter, we are faced with a number of market factors that will impact our near-term results. Beyond the flash supply dynamic, other challenges include: we expect to be negatively impacted by the widely publicized CPU shortage. Industry analysts have estimated the PC unit growth will be constrained between 5% to 10% for the current quarter with the situation potentially lingering into early calendar year 2019.","We are experiencing a temporary slowdown in Data Center capital spending, particularly by large cloud service providers after several quarters of growth above the expected long-term exabyte growth rate of 40% for capacity enterprise. We are in the midst of adjusting to a more normal growth rate.","For the calendar year 2018, we now project capacity enterprise exabyte growth of approximately 55%. Based on discussions with our customers, we expect stronger growth to resume in the second half of calendar year 2019.","Steve has already talked about how the global business environment is contributing to a risk averse orientation with our end markets. These dynamics are having a disproportionate impact on certain end markets outside the U.S., particularly China.","As a management team, we are well aware of the current macroeconomic and industry conditions and are taking appropriate actions to respond, while ensuring we invest for future growth and leadership across the markets we serve.","Examples of our progress in the first quarter were: we maintained our leading position across all the brands in our Client Solutions portfolio, including G-Tech, SanDisk and WD. Client Devices experienced healthy demand in both surveillance hard drives and in embedded mobile flash solutions versus a year ago. Leading smartphone providers continue to increase the average capacity per device, which is driving ongoing growth for our mobile products.","Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue grew year-over-year, driven primarily by continued demand for our capacity enterprise hard drive. In addition, we experienced record revenue in our emerging data center systems products, a strategic growth area we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in December.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As Peter mentioned earlier, we've updated our disclosures to provide investors with additional transparency into our business. In particular, we are providing a breakdown of our total revenue and non-GAAP gross margins for flash products and hard drives. These disclosures are included within the earnings presentation available on our IR website.","I will now review the financial performance for the September quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 3% on a year-over-year basis and below our original outlook for the quarter. The shortfall was primarily driven by weaker-than-expected flash pricing. Specifically, our flash-based products had revenue bit growth of 28% sequentially, while the average selling price was down 16%.","The September quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our Data Center revenue growth continues to be driven by cloud-related storage.","Client Devices revenue was $2.7 billion, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We had significant growth in embedded flash and surveillance products, offset by client compute hard drives.","Client Solutions revenue was $932 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by the normalization trends in flash market pricing.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 38%, down 430 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin declined primarily due to a reduction in flash ASPs.","Non-GAAP OpEx for the September quarter totaled $820 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Given the current environment, we continue to align our spending with our top priorities.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the September quarter was $906 million, or $3.04 per share. In the September quarter, we generated $705 million of operating cash flow.","We continued to reinvest in our business with $248 million in capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $457 million. In the September quarter, we had a sequential increase in inventory primarily driven by a return to normal operating levels for capacity enterprise products. Flash inventory grew slightly contrary to normal seasonal trends as a result of the market factors that Mike identified.","In the September quarter, we returned $711 million to shareholders, of which $148 million was in dividends and $563 million was through share repurchases. These share repurchases put us on target of our goal to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock during fiscal year 2019 depending on market conditions. We continue to believe this is an attractive capital allocation opportunity and demonstrates the confidence we have in our long-term outlook. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling approximately $4.8 billion.","Before I provide our guidance, I would like to describe the financial impact of our decision to reduce our flash output through reduced wafer starts and delayed deployment of capital equipment. We expect to reduce our planned flash output by approximately 10% to 15% for calendar year 2019. The goal of these actions is to bring our supply more in line with the demand environment with the majority of the supply reduction occurring by the middle of calendar year 2019.","Based on our current plan to temporarily reduce our flash output, we expect to take a GAAP-only charge in the range of $250 million to $300 million spread over the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2019. This charge is driven by our fab capacity decisions and does not reflect an incremental cash payment. As Mike indicated, we may adjust our plans based on market conditions, and this could impact the extent of any charges.","I will now provide our guidance for the second fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion; gross margin in the range of 32% to 33%; operating expenses between $760 million and $780 million; interest and other expense of approximately $105 million; an effective tax rate of 10% to 12%; diluted shares of approximately $295 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.65.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and I appreciate the additional disclosures given tonight. I just want to try and dissect a little bit the guidance that you just laid out. Help us understand the variables to consider between the hard disk drive revenue assumptions and that of the flash assumptions. And then also, on the gross margin line, looks like just simple math is that you're able to take your cost down by a high-teens percentage rate on a year-over-year basis this last quarter. How are you thinking about the cost-down equation and what's the assumption you're making for flash gross margin in this current quarter? Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, why don't I let Mike talk about the product side and the cost side first, and then I'll finish with the modeling question?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So, on the cost-down, just as we think about costs, we've talked about the long-term range of between 15% and 25%. We've been operating and expect to be operating near the low end of that. We continue to see that as our expectation, and obviously, we'll update this further with more perspective at the Analyst Day in December. Relative to the product impacts, it's roughly impacted equally on both sides between the HDD and the flash business relative to the impact in question.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so from a modeling standpoint, when you think about the HDD side, the capacity enterprise and client compute contribute to the decrease in revenue. And then on the flash side, we have the pricing environment reducing revenue as well as mobility declines. The margin changes are largely a function of the flash pricing environment and then the lower mix of capacity enterprise on the hard drive side.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Aaron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Steve, appreciate the incremental disclosure on the flash side. That's very helpful. Clearly, you're taking some actions here to curtail flash output to be in line with demand. But can you give us some sense of how long do you think that it might take to get the supply-demand back into balance? Sounds like mid next year possibly in the way that you are currently thinking about it. And why do you expect this action will be followed by other competitors versus a strategy of potentially share gains, that is, they keep pricing down and try to gain bit growth as opposed to sort of reducing output similar to what you're doing?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so let me add color on that. Our \u2013 the efforts that we're taking are intended to get our supply-demand equation in balance by the middle of calendar 2019. We don't know what the rest of the industry is going to do. And so your comment in terms of why we think that the industry's going to follow, that's not a correct characterization, that's going to depend upon the behavior of our competitors.","And so, really, what we're trying to do is, if you want to call it that, get our own house in order so that we are better positioned to take advantage of, let's call it, the long-term growth opportunities in the market. And in particular, to kind of put a finer point on it, we would expect that demand from a seasonal perspective would pick up in the second half of calendar 2019. And getting our inventory situation in better balance will position us better than we otherwise would have been if we had not taken these actions.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, and just to add a little color on that, our costs bring us in line with what we expect the end market demand to be. So straight calculation there is it's obviously intending to maintain share.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. And the other thing I would add is there is no intent or implied shift bit share loss in our numbers. In other words, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we still intend to have enough bits or supply to demand our customer commitments. This is really a matter of supply has been outstripping demand for a variety of different reasons. We want to get that excess out of the system and better position us going forward.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the color. If I could really quickly, when you think about the gross margin trajectory here, obviously, the flash margins have been compressing here a few quarters and going to continue. But as you think about these capacity reductions coming ahead, should we expect gross margins to compress beyond the December quarter here like at least for the next couple of quarters at this point? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, it's a great question. And the reality is that, I'll be sort of literal, we don't know for sure. We're going to have to wait and see, but we would expect that we would continue to face a challenging flash market through the first half of calendar 2019. And so that implies that there could be further margin compression, but at what rate, we will have to see.","But we don't \u2013 these reductions that we're making from a wafer start perspective will not begin to hit just because of lead time for us until the first quarter of 2019. It will primarily allow us to reduce our inventory. And then, of course, we've got the demand environment that we're dealing with and whatever competitive dynamics we'll be dealing with. But we do expect the first half of 2019 to continue to be challenging for us and for the industry.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the color too (23:22).","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Any additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, in light of the wafer start change and delaying CapEx, would love to hear your thoughts on how you think about scale and other factors to enable best-of-breed cost-down in this highly competitive market.","So are there other avenues to lift that sort of low end of the range of 15% that you're focused on, perhaps pulling in 96-layer or above or faster move to QLC? Would love to hear your thoughts, particularly in light of six players plus YMTC entering the fold. Thank you.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Relative to the cost declines, you're on the points. It's tech transition, so rate in which we convert to the next node, and the implementation of QLC over the longer horizon. That's a bigger lever.","The thing we are highlighting in our projections as of now is just the realities of the 3D era, right. They're more capital intensive and the cost declines are going to certainly be less than they were in the 2D era. So that's all part of how the market and the industry is having to plan differently.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. And we continue to \u2013 because of the joint venture structure and that, we continue to expect to benefit from scale despite the reduction in wafer starts, because it's only our capacity that we're reducing those wafer starts.","But if you look at the total output of the joint venture, we continue to have the broader benefit of scale semiconductor manufacturing operations.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryani (sic) [Amit Daryanani] (25:25) of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Amitesh Bajad for Amit Daryanani. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the NAND ASP decline, do you at this point see any risk of you having to cut pricing on the HDD side as well? Or actually, at what point do you think that NAND ASP declines could pressure you to cut HDD pricing to slow down the substitution of SSDs versus HDD?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. I think in the case of relative pricing, that's not the direct impact. It really is the rate of cannibalization. And we have seen that accelerate. We would expect we exit the year about 60% in terms of SSD versus HDD in the PC space.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. And just to comment on that because the \u2013 as painful as it is, the announced closure of our Kuala Lumpur manufacturing facility anticipated continued decline, particularly in terms of client hard drives.","And so that expected uptick in terms of substitution of SSDs for hard drives has been factored into our plans. And we'll continue to look at opportunities at how do we optimize our manufacturing footprint in light of that. But the KL activity, that closure, not to take it lightly, but was done in direct response to that anticipated uptick.","Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And if I could just have one follow-up. The cost-downs of 15% to 25% range, do you think that could have like some kind of a downside bias next year as you ramp up 96-layers?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","So if your question is a downside bias to the lower end of that range, I think we'll give you more commentary in December what we think next year will look like.","Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group LLP","Thanks for taking my question. This is for the entire team. Inventories have been going up since earlier this year, and I'm just curious how you're thinking about the debt covenants, especially given your guide and your comment about the margin erosion. Is there any of the covenants that would be at the risk of default? And is there anything other than the cost-down, manufacturing cost-down, that you could do to improve cash flows and minimize a downside risk? Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","So, in terms of our covenants, through our refinancings and the optimization of our balance sheet earlier in this calendar year, we put ourselves in a good position to manage through volatility. And we remain in good standing with respect to our covenants. And our current forecast keeps us in a good position with respect to compliance.","As it relates to managing cash flow, we are looking at all the levers, as Steve pointed out. That's part of our overall review. We look at our manufacturing footprint. We look at how we manage working capital. We look at our OpEx levels, and we are constantly pushing to both manage our business as efficiently as we can with respect to the current market environment and then make sure that we are also investing in the right ways for what we see as some very good long-term opportunities and some very good growth potential on the capacity enterprise hard drive side and in the flash business.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. And, Mehdi, just to add color to that, because I think it's important to emphasize, when we looked at the decision to cut capacity, not cut capacity, I mean, ultimately, what we were solving for was what did we think was a better answer from a cash perspective. And that action in and of itself, just as a for instance, provides us with a meaningful net cash positive. And so that is something that we are constantly looking at mechanisms to optimize not only on a short-term basis but on a long-term basis.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group LLP","But what is it with inventory? And it ties into my question, the days of inventory are up 30% year-over-year up and 2% Q-over-Q, and this is kind of the repeat pattern that happens. And I'm just \u2013 to understand, as you focus on a cost-down, is there something with the mix or is there something with your inventory hubs that this still needs to be looked at?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, let me give some color on the inventory situation. The inventory is up. It's up more than we want it to be, okay, let's put that out there first. But it's up for three principal reasons. One is is that we have more flash inventory than we'd like, all right? That's why we're taking the wafer start cuts so that we get that inventory back down to a more acceptable level, better matched in terms of supply and demand. So that will be corrected, barring there being other changes in demand and that kind of thing, that will be corrected over the course of the next \u2013 well, through the middle of calendar 2019 because of those actions.","The other thing is is that we have built up a bit of more inventory, not excess inventory, but more inventory. As we look to close our Kuala Lumpur facility and transition that manufacturing, we need some buffer inventory to enable that transition because you can't unplug it from one factory and plug it into another factory and not lose any manufacturing. You have manufacturing downtime as a consequence of that. That's the second reason.","The third reason is that we have largely been running over the course of the previous nine months, let's just say, at very high demand levels in terms of capacity enterprise. And so we've been a little bit, let's call it, hand to mouth without much buffer inventory in terms of capacity inventory.","As that market, well, not only begins to soften, but as it softens, we'll see a returning to a more normal level of capacity inventory for capacity hard drives because the demand predictability on the part of our partners or our customers is not necessarily that great. They don't want to go down in terms of having drives, and so we tend to hold a little bit more extra inventory for them in order to maintain high levels of service. So that's in brief the explanation of what's going on with our inventory balance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Sorry if I missed this, but could you give us a little bit more color on the GAAP charge that you're taking to take the utilization down? I guess, my understanding of the way the JV fab works is that when it's underloaded that you still pay the higher cash cost for those wafers reflecting the underloading. So, can you just help me understand what that charge actually is?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","So the technical structure of the JV is not as you describe. It's actually that we make cash payments to the JV, but it's not for the purpose of purchasing wafers. As a result, it's what I referred to as the \u2013 we have no incremental cash payments, but we do continue to make cash payments in connection with our JV agreement to basically pay for the CapEx, appreciation, et cetera.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","The CapEx that we have not funded directly.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Exactly.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So they own the buildings. They do that. They have the labor. We have to pay for the labor, things like that.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Right. So this is a true underutilization charge that we are taking. It doesn't have anything to do with the purchasing of wafers.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Munjal Shah of UBS. Your line is now open.","Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. I had a question on the capacity drives. How broad-based is the softness from your end customers? You mentioned outside of U.S. macro impacts, but is it more broad-based on the capacity enterprise side?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So on the capacity enterprise side, it is quite broad-based. We're seeing it sort of across all \u2013 our comments relative to China were not specific to the cloud providers. It's really more broadly our assessment of the market in China. So just to separate it distinctly, broad impact on cloud service providers on a worldwide basis. And then the China comment was more general to broad market slowness in China.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Just to add to that, I mean, really, what we're seeing, and I don't want us to sound alarmist, but we've seen other people talk about it in terms of reports in that. The simplest way of characterizing it in terms of what's happening from a broader demand perspective is there's a bit of a risk-off kind of mentality in terms of our customers, end markets, all that. So everybody is kind of leaning out in effect their supply chains. So if you look at the hyperscale guys, they're going to push up their utilization rates to higher levels than maybe what they were operating at.","If you look at, say, it's a PC company, they're going to thin out their inventories, our channel partners are going to chin up (35:56). So there's a \u2013 but it's generally under this guise of kind of just taking a little bit of air out of the balloon from a risk standpoint. We are doing the same. We are absolutely doing the same and taking actions from a cost, from a capacity perspective, from an expense perspective that is reflective of that environment.","Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC","No, that's going to help. (36:20) And just related, do you think that the cloud customers might have, like, double order? I know you mentioned that you keep extra inventory to kind of provide service, but do you think that they might have given higher forecast or ordered more and that's why you have inventory?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","No, I don't think we have any specific indications of that, but I think, as Steve said, they are taking a more conservative posture. I think in some indications, they are continuing to consume some inventory, but that's not the primary driver.","Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Any additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. Given what the share price has done recently plus your outlook to earnings, any changes to the way you think about capital deployment for your stock buyback or the early cadence of it or do you need to keep that cash a little more handy for your closing of Kuala Lumpur and your shifting in other business? So just wondering if there's any change in the tempo. I know what you've done historically, that's for sure. But just kind of thinking and getting a pulse and sense currently on the stock buyback.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. There's no change \u2013 yeah, there's no change to our capital allocation strategy. As we have said, we have a balanced strategy. We allocate the capital among our top priorities. So investing in the business, our CapEx, and then we look at, of course, the dividend and our share repurchases. We had targeted $1.5 billion for repurchases in fiscal 2019, and as we said, we remain on track for that.","So there's really no change other than we do agree that, with the current share price, it is an attractive use of capital. And we will factor that into our balanced strategy going forward.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then as a quick follow-up, you mentioned the word dividend. That was my follow-up, is how should we think about dividend going forward? Do you use it as a percent of cash flow, as a rate of change in earnings? Could the dividend be reduced since the yield is going higher? How should we think about the dividend?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, dividend is a critical part. We're not that formulaic, I would say, number one. But the dividend is a key part of our capital allocation program, if you want to call it that. And we continue to expect it to be that way going forward.","And we'll look at different factors and see if we want to modulate it. But clearly, in the short term, we're not looking at anything that would \u2013 we're not looking at cutting the dividend. I can assure you of that.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much for the details. It's greatly appreciated.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I had two questions, if I may. The first question is just really perhaps trying to level-set some things on what is your comfort level about hyperscale end demand beyond the December quarter? I think one of your primary memory peers spoke about some challenges in server demand, server memory demand for the first half of 2019. I'm just kind of curious, how should we think about the impact on your nearline hard drive business?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, let me answer that. So, yes, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we expect more robust growth to return to that sector in the second half of calendar 2019. So that's the way we're thinking about it currently.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So the first half will continue to be certainly weak compared to what we saw last year. But that was \u2013 the growth was above the longer-term exabyte growth rate of 40%. But we expect this, if you want to call it, stall from a buying perspective to persist through the first half and then resume to more normal patterns in the back half of 2019.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Right.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. I guess, with that demand backdrop, you obviously run a fairly lean operation today. But how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx as the macro drives some lower revenue near term, but you're also going to rationalize your hard drive facility? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So as I think both Steve and Mike mentioned, we are very focused on optimizing our cost and expense structure, given the market environment. As we indicated, our OpEx will be trending down in the current quarter. And we will look for opportunities to continue to improve that and reduce that going forward. So...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","While also making sure that we're not cutting our nose off in spite of our face in terms of enabling our technology and product competitiveness over a longer threshold.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. I appreciate you guys taking my question. Just sticking right there, Steve, if we could, with nearline. Should we think \u2013 I mean, what do you think is the wisest for us to do as you think about first half of 2019? Exabyte, should we think of it as flattish?","And I know the term growth even though muted has been used. So do you actually think you can get back to a little growth? Or should we think of it as this more flattish \u2013 or actually just how should we think of it? Then...","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, I think the best way to think about it year-over-year is very flattish.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it, for first half. And then the thinking is that...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","In exabyte terms.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","On exabyte terms.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","In exabyte terms, Ananda.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Correct.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then just, Steve, you had mentioned sort of the risk-off broadly. Is there any way to get a sense of \u2013 or do you guys have a view on \u2013 for nearline, how much of sort of the exabyte softening is risk-off versus just sort of cycle winding down?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I'm not sure I'm smart enough to dimension that. I'll turn and see if Mike's got a sense for that.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, I think it's a combination of the two. I think, obviously, there's been a rapid build-out that has been occurring. Different providers have had different drivers of their build-out. So, in some instances, they're onetime things that are sort of behind them. In other instances, as you know, in addition to the risk-off, once they do a large build-out, they'll move into an optimization mode. So there's some of that going on as well. So it's a combination of those things that are really creating the demand environment we're articulating here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Joseph Donnelly - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. This is John Donnelly on for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the CPU shortage, can you describe how you see your customers positioned? Are they waiting to buy the storage components or is there a potential for some excess inventory to build up there?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Our view of it would be this. First of all, depending on which part of our market, it's not, let's call it, proportionally impacting the market. So it's less in the first year and more elsewhere. And we actually see it as a constraint to shipments in the period. So that's how we are evaluating it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Raksha of Mizahu (sic) [Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho] (44:26). Your line is now open.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah, hi, guys, just looking at the 2019 guide on NAND for 36% to 38% bit growth, just wondering how you spread it between 64- layer and 96-layer.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","We haven't commented on that. We'll give you more insight on that in December.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","But I will add that we are making good progress. I mean, very pleased with our ramp of 64- layer and 96-layer technology. So we feel that we are very competitively positioned in that regard.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. And on the hard disk drive side, you talked about nearline being a little flattish year-on-year first half, but what kind of cost declines could you get \u2013 or density increases could you get next year in terms of when you compare to the cost declines on the NAND side?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So relative to the Data Center side of the business, capacity enterprise in particular, we think that cost decline runs roughly at the same rate. So in that sort of 15% to 25%, so it tracks nicely.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to get a sense as to what you felt the new entry Yangtze Memory Technologies' cost competitiveness is relative to your joint venture with Toshiba and whether or not they are absorbing some of the share given the trade tensions that you talked about?","Stephen D.

Welcome to the Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you, and good afternoon. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, HDD demand for the March quarter and calendar year 2013 and our financial results expectations for the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on November 2, 2012.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures.","Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and other charges.","Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, CFO, Wolfgang Nickl, will provide additional commentary on our December quarter results and outlook for the March quarter.","I am pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. The quarter exhibited continued soft industry demand driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, weak PC demand and inventory rebalancing by our customers. Over the last several quarters, both of our subsidiaries have done an excellent job of managing through challenging market conditions. This is particularly noteworthy given our company's specific cost challenges associated with the recovery from the Thailand floods. We have continued to focus intensely on those variables we control, allowing us to produce better-than-expected revenue and profitability and strong cash generation.","In calendar 2013, we have several opportunities to improve our business. We believe that the overall market for hard drives is beginning to stabilize. We expect demand for the first half of calendar 2013 to be flat to slightly down compared with the back half of 2012. However, we are cautiously optimistic for the back half of 2013 for the following reasons: Worldwide economies continue to expand, albeit at a slow pace, with signs of further improvement in developing regions. OEM customers have largely worked through their inventory rebalancing. Accordingly, we have improving visibility with regards to true customer demand. Our customers are accelerating their product innovation with thinner and lighter designs, coupled with touch-enabled features and there are early indications of consumers' stronger intentions to purchase new PCs this year.","I am most pleased with Western Digital's leadership position in the storage industry. We sit at the center of a vast ecosystem where data growth continues unabated. In this context, we continue to have multiple opportunities to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. We are working to develop and bring the market innovative solutions in 3 areas: the public and private clouds, thin and light client systems and the Connected Life or personal cloud for homes and small businesses.","Specifically, in the cloud environment, demand for our high-capacity drives remained strong. Total cost of ownership is a significant issue for our customers in the high-capacity market, and we have seen broad interest in our new 7 disk helium-filled drive. This innovative solution will deliver 40% energy savings over current offerings. Our expanding portfolio of enterprise class solid state drives continues to gain increasing acceptance with our customers. For the third consecutive quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth with our SSD enterprise drives.","In the thin and light category, customers are increasingly deploying our 7-millimeter hard drives, and enthusiasm for our new 5-millimeter and solid state hybrid drive platforms is high.","And for the Connected Life, we continue to develop solutions that help consumers manage, store, access and experience their personal and professional content seamlessly. With more ways to create and share content, consumers are increasingly turning to external drives as the best storage choice. For example, we see tablets with USB ports driving adoption of direct attached devices. We are also seeing tablet users increasingly adopt our network attached storage for added capacity.","In my new role as the CEO of Western Digital, I am excited to be leading this great company at such a compelling time of change and opportunity in the storage industry. With our HGST and WD teams, we have the people, the platform, the technology and the financial engine to innovate and address changing customer needs.  We will continue to lead by innovating, executing and allocating capital in a thoughtful way.","Wolfgang will now provide our report on Q2 and our outlook for Q3.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize the total market demand and I'll consolidate the financial performance for the December quarter and then conclude with a range of our expected financial results for the March quarter.","The HDD market shipped approximately 136 million units during the December quarter, slightly less than the 140 million units we anticipated in our guidance. We saw continued inventory rebalancing at our OEM customers and our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean. By challenging market conditions, both from a macro and IT perspective, we delivered very strong financial results.","Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shipped a total of 59.2 million hard drives. Our average HDD selling price was $62, flat with the prior quarter. Favorable mix offset modest like-for-like price decline.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 27.7%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 28.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 70 basis points better than what was implied in our guidance, which was a function of lower-than-anticipated price declines and better-than-expected mix.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $540 million for the December quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets.","We incurred charges of $41 million in the December quarter reflecting continued discipline in aligning our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we've already incurred charges of $80 million and $26 million in the June and September quarters, respectively.  Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $10 million.","Tax expense for the December quarter was $133 million or 28% of pretax income. Tax expense included a one-time charge of $88 million due to the passage of Proposition 39 in California. Without this one-time charge, tax expense would have been $45 million or 8% of non-GAAP pretax income.","Our net income for the December quarter totaled $335 million or $1.36 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $513 million or $2.09 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $772 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $526 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $246 million. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be at the upper end of our CapEx model of 5% to 7%, including approximately $200 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand.","Excluding the flood-related spending, we would be close to the bottom end of our model range. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy announced in September, we repurchased 4.2 million shares for $146 million. As of the end of last quarter, an authorization of $2.4 billion remains available for future repurchase.","In addition, we declared the dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60.2 million which we paid on December 26 to shareholders of record as of December 14. On October 15, we also paid out the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60.9 million, which are all declared during the September quarter.","We exited fiscal Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.7 billion.","I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter.","We expect a total available market flat to slightly down when compared with the December quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion reflecting the current demand environment, the seasonal change in business mix and the conclusion of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing arrangement with Toshiba. Gross margin of approximately 28% excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $540 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, a tax rate of approximately 7% and a share count of approximately 244 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.80 for the March quarter.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Steve, Wolfgang, just 2 if I could. I guess the first is on the mix dynamic that you expect to -- you experienced in the December quarter and expect to experience in the March quarter. Can you talk to some of the specifics of what you're seeing. And I mean, I guess to the extent you can talk about what, how, I guess what would you expect kind of as we go through the year, if we should expect what's going to happen in March to extend beyond that, and I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Ananda, yes, the December quarter was favorable and mixed both from a product mix perspective and also from a business mix perspective. You can see that also from our Investors summary page. Notebook and desktop were combined slightly down when compared to the September quarter, enterprise and branded were up quite a bit. So you can see we had a quite significant positive impact from a business mix, which led to us maintaining the $62 ASP. When you look into the March quarter, you usually see PC sales just seasonally going down by some percentage, probably 6% to 8% if you look at history. And in the branded sales, it's slowing down a little bit after the holiday season. So those are the 2 major impacts that, just from a mix perspective, weigh in on the ASP.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. And I guess as far as benefit from mix, as you move through the year, your major competitor has kind of been talking about they expect industry mix dynamics to lean more positive as you move through the year both within the books and then also with hybrid being introduced in May. Just interested in getting your thoughts on, I guess, how sudden the mix can be as we go through the year and the impact that could have on the industry business model.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, I'll take that question. I think that, I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind, I mean, really 2 comments: I mean, one, mix is always a bit of a dynamic thing and it's something that we, from a business standpoint, actively manage to improve our overall financial performance. So there's a lot of, call it, tactical things that we do within a quarter to make sure that we are getting an appropriate amount of mixup with our customers and with our products and that sort of thing. But the other thing that I think that we have to keep in mind, which is a very important point in that the secular changes that are occurring within the industry are actually very favorable from a mix perspective. So clearly, where we've seen pressure from a volume perspective has been on the client space. That traditionally has -- carries a lower ASP, a lower mix. But where we continue to see very solid growth, although at a lower unit number, has been in the higher capacity enterprise space, particularly the cloud. And then not only that, in terms of the branded business or the personal cloud or Connected Life. And so those things, as you move through the year, and not only that but I think as we move forward into the future, we'll continue to benefit our business both from a average selling price perspective or a mix perspective and then accordingly, if we continue to do our jobs appropriately, from an overall margin perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele of Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","The yen, the changes in the currency relative to the dollar, did that help or hurt the business in the quarter? And I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","It was a little bit of a help for us on the OpEx side. And going forward, we're including the yen in our hedging program. So it should have minimal impact on ongoing results.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then in terms of your own procurement from a component perspective over the balance of '13, can you just update us on your own progress on internal production levels or capability?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, we're planning on steady progress and towards the latter end of the year, we'll be in within our purchasing parameters and also mixing into the new areal density. So we're making steady progress there.","Stephen D. Milligan","So we have some more work to do.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","By the end of the year, do you mean the fiscal year or the calendar?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I think we'll make progress throughout the calendar year.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And let me just ask one on the OpEx. You guided to $540 million, which is obviously up when you adjust out for the items. Presumably the $540 million is exiting items. So where is the increase sequentially?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, Richard, what we do is, I mean, we talked before that we have a pretty -- focusing on operating our OpEx pretty variable and we have 6  months incentive programs and since -- when we set them on the July time frame, our expectation of total market demand was different. They didn't quite payout at the level that we anticipated originally and that's why we guided to $525 million. Obviously, we performed better than our guidance. So they paid out a little bit higher and then we have the said impact from the yen, well, that will get us to the $529 million. So the $540 million is a bit of progress compared to the $550 million run rate that we referred to earlier, but the main difference is incentive payouts, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicholas.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think you alluded to a little bit of it in the last question, but when I look at your gross margin and I think about it from a COGS per unit basis, it looks like it was up sequentially this last quarter and actually getting close to that, what would be historically a high level. So I guess my question is you mentioned areal density and you'd make progress towards that. Could you talk a little bit about where you're at on that areal density curve and when those yields start to show up? And how maybe we should think about the COGS per unit number as a function of gross margin?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, again, I mean, both Steve and I commented on business mix changes. We got to be really, really careful with the COGS per unit because there's so many different businesses blended in. Again, I'll point you to the enterprise and branded numbers where we disclosed the volume and you'll see that we had pretty good sequential increases there. In terms of the areal density, we have said before, partly due to the flood, we're behind on deploying those. We're nowhere close to being done on this and, again, I don't think we'll make progress there throughout the fiscal year -- calendar year. Steve?","Stephen D. Milligan","Aaron, let me add a comment there. I think that relative to -- there's a lot of things that are going on in terms of our cost, and I just want to give you my perspective. One of the things -- and let's be realistic with regards to ourselves. We have seen versus where we were before, and this is an industry statement, a pretty significant decrease in volumes. So if we -- it would be unfair to isolate per se cost opportunities that we have to areal density alone, right? We have -- we obviously have more capacity than what we're producing because we're throttling it to what we see as demand. But we are taking actions to reset our capacity potential to a more appropriate level given what we view the secular changes in terms of the overall demand profile for the industry, not that we don't expect to see growth but not at the same rates than what we've historically done. So the point being is that there are multiple opportunities that we have as an organization to continue to improve our cost structure. And it's an area, it is probably other than innovation and those kinds of things and introducing some of the new products that we've talked about, getting traction in regards to that as we move to the back half of the year, and continuing to improve our cost structure on multiple fronts is one of the larger opportunities that we have as an organization.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up, obviously, there's a lot of talk about hybrids. You talked about 7-millimeter, a lot of interest. Where do you stand on the current 5-millimeter platform? And should we expect those to start to materialize from a volume or design cycle basis by the end of calendar '13?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So what we talked about before and it continues to be the case is that right now what we're doing is we're shipping engineering samples to customers. We're actively engaged with them in terms of working with them as to how to utilize the new form factor as well as the solid state hybrid drive. We're making good progress in that regard. But we don't expect any revenue to materialize until we move into the back half of calendar 2013, with hopefully it being more of a meaningful contributor particularly as we move into 2014, calendar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw of DISCERN.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","If you could give us an update, I'd appreciate it. You mentioned it. It sounds like you still -- like you've got a better sense of cyclical versus secular. If you could give us some color on any changes in that and how you're feeling about it and then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","I think that the 2 secular things that we're really dealing with and, obviously, they're related is, one, reset of overall volumes, and I talked about that earlier. And oh by the way, we talked about it at the Investor Day overall. We are not going to put our head in the sand and disregard the changes that are occurring around us, and so volume levels are lower than what we had seen, call it, pre-flood, and it's not just a flood dynamic obviously. It's changes that we're seeing within the overall IT space. And so we're dealing with that in terms of how we react from that perspective. And then additionally is where we are seeing growth in data and the innovations and the products that are required, and so we're seeing -- and that's when we talk about the 3 areas of investment in terms of the Connected Life, in terms of thin and light, and then as well in terms of the public and private cloud. So we're repositioning and continuing to reposition our roadmap and repositioning our investments to those areas so that we're appropriately optimized in those regards.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And then as we do look at some of those investment areas, the thin and light, I know expectations are going into the Windows 8 launch were, for many people, quite high. If you could give us any sort of updated view that you might have on that. And also elaborate to Connected Life, if you have done any sort of -- and I know that's historically sort of looking out into this kind [ph] a little bit, but any sort of sense for someone moves up of a PC and onto a tablet, what happens to sort of gigabyte demand if they go to a personal cloud or start storing things in the enterprise? Does that drive demand for more gigabytes or less or how should we think about that?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, I think that in terms of the 5-millimeter, the thing that we have to keep in mind, and this is related to not only the 5-millimeter form factor but also as it relates to solid state hybrid drives, is that there are design windows to work with our customers on. And so we did not -- well first off, product is not generally available or shipping, it's still under development, but we are sampling with our customers. But we also have to hit the design time frames, design windows with our customers, and so that's why I go back to the point that we do not anticipate there being any shipment of those both from a development standpoint and from a design in perspective until the back half of 2013 with an all likelihood of being a more meaningful contributor in 2014. And so that's the 5-millimeter story, but we are encouraged with the progress that we're making and the interest on behalf of our customers. On the Connected Life, I mean, frankly, it's a little bit too early to call out specific data. And so -- but clearly one of the issues that's going on from a tablet perspective, I mean, tablet -- and I alluded to it in our prepared remarks, is that the storage capability on tablets is not that great, but yet the density, particularly, when you're talking about high def kind of content, video content, requires higher storage capacity and so, therefore, particularly as it relates to Win 8 and things like that or Android tablets is that they are USB enabled so that people can store more data on hard drives giving them, enabling them to access content at that higher video quality, thus increasing their experience from a consumer standpoint. But it's difficult to cite specific data as to how that plays out. But fundamentally, our job is to provide solutions to our consumers and to our customers that facilitates more and more data growth, and that's what we're trying to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could give us a little bit of detail on the different end markets in the past. I think you've given some comments about how those performed, so I was hoping you can give us some detail on the overall market.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I can give you a few points. Like I said before, if you dissect the 136 for the December quarter, desktop was pretty much like we expected it somewhere in the 44.5 million range. Notebook was a little bit weaker than we expected because there was inventory rebalancing going on, but approximately the same 44.5 million to 45 million units. Enterprise was solid, 2 million quarter-over-quarter and improvement there to 15.5 million. I think, we're mostly through the inventory situation there. So that was solid. CE, which includes gaming, was about 15 million units and then branded products, like we said, and it's also driven by the desire to back up and attach DAS and NAS products was 15.5 million units or so, which was also very solid. And we have performed well in all of these areas. Our company share is about 44% and we have more or less around 40% to 46% in all of these areas. So that's pretty much the market, for example, last quarter.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, is there any extra inventory that you see in the various channels? I know you commented that disti is relatively lean, but we've had some inventory overhang. You've made some comments on the different segments. But just wanted to get an overall sense of work done with the inventory. And in the March quarter, do you expect to maintain your share? Or do you expect to lose or gain share?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So Sherri, I'll address the inventory and the share question. I think we said that the inventory rebalancing is largely complete, which means that it's not -- it's been reduced. There are small pockets, very small pockets. There's always small pockets where there might be some inventory corrections but nothing that we can tell and we don't have perfect visibility through all of the supply chain because it's not just our inventory or even our customers, it can be customers' inventory in the channel, but we don't believe there's anything meaningful from an inventory perspective. And then share, I mean, obviously our goal is to do the best job we can with our customers. And we believe that if we continue to do a great job with our customers, we're going to continue to do well from a share perspective, and where that leaves us, we'll have to kind of figure that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland out of Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, you mentioned better visibility, was that a comment on inventory? Or was there something more there?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, I think what was happening, as you go back to the past, I mean, the past several quarters, there was a much more meaningful overhang of inventory. The other thing is that we have to keep in mind is that our customers have been going through a significant product transition in terms of Windows 8, Windows 7, and then you got all the macroeconomic concerns and all the uncertainty associated with that. There wasn't -- I mean, so those things are beginning to lift. Accordingly, that gives us better visibility.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And there was some talk maybe a quarter or 2 ago about a 600 million TAM for cal '13 is that -- that seems tough, I guess, at this point?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, in Steve's remarks, he said that the first half of calendar '13 would be roughly flat to slightly down with the second half of calendar year '12, and I think there was 275 million or so. And then we feel cautiously optimistic about the second half of the calendar year, but will it give us a lift to 325? Probably not. So 600 seems like a high number at this point.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And last question for me, Wolfgang, as data storage slowly drifts towards the cloud in different applications at a different pace, could you talk about your enterprise business and the strength there? Are those cloud buyers or is that traditional enterprise? And what are the expectations going forward?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well I think that, I mean, the primary area where we're seeing growth is in high-capacity enterprise and that's really across the board. I mean, obviously, and we don't talk specifically about customers and things like that. But generally, we're seeing strength across the board in that regard and so -- but the performance, traditional performance enterprise, is a pretty stable market, not necessarily anticipating there to be meaningful growth in that regard, but still a great part of the market for us and for the industry. And in terms of how we feel like we're positioned, we feel like we're very well positioned in multiple regards. We talked about where we have our existing products. We're very strong in terms of the enterprise SSD market, not necessarily that material within the whole grand scheme of things but certainly helps us from an overall portfolio perspective with our customers in terms of offering them solutions. And then with the introduction of the helium-filled drive and that innovation, we really feel very, very strong not only about our existing portfolio but about where we're going in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Craig of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve or Wolfgang, can you maybe talk about your utilization you think that you're running the factories at right now and maybe sort of the industry utilization. And then when do you expect to make decisions or the industry make decisions on how you should adjust capacity as you sort of head into the back part of the year. If things don't quite work out, how you're viewing them right now? And then along the lines of the CapEx, Wolfgang, why wouldn't CapEx be below the bottom end of the range given the significant, probably overcapacity, that's in the industry right now?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I'll give you a few pointers and I'll let Steve add on. I mean, as Steve indicated earlier, with the volumes being lower, I mean, despite the fact that we are adjusting our capacity at a reasonable pace, you should assume that we have more capacity than we need at least in certain aspects of our business. It's always a little bit difficult to answer because it's not like one big box that you're utilizing, you have a wafer fab and you have HTA [ph] and you have media, et cetera. But you see that we're very, very active in rightsizing the capacity and I gave you the jobs that we took. So we're doing that in a reasonable, realtime fashion and that's one key contributor how we continue to stay in the margin model. In terms of capital, we're doing a capital spending as realtime as possible. We are focusing our capital spend entirely on areal density progression, on technology advancement, on supply flexibility. For instance, we had only one slide of app [ph] and now we have, I think, 2. So we're not investing in capacity. With the exception of test, as we move more into these capacity enterprise rise, they just require a longer test time, and those are the key components that made our capital spending, and we continue to do what we have always done. We will manage this very, very tightly and realtime.","Operator","It comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just 2 quick questions from me. Given the strength on the branded business in the fourth quarter and given how the floods may have affected your production during the year, is there any chance that may be you left some money on the table in terms of consumer demand with branded? And if so, is there any -- how would that impact this calendar year? And then secondly, just a little bit more color on enterprise, if possible. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you're seeing enterprise demand that is seasonally in line with expectations above, below. Any kind of color there would help.","Stephen D. Milligan","Can you clarify the question on leaving money on the table. I wasn't quite sure I...","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Well, I'm wondering if you were able to meet demand on branded products across all your retail partners or whether maybe there was more demand at the end of the year that maybe you anticipated.","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't believe that was any issues with that, not to my knowledge. But if you know of anything, we'd be happy to support it. So and then I'm sorry, now, I got distracted on the second part of the question.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yes, that's okay. I'm just trying to understand the March quarter seasonality on the enterprise class drives especially high-capacity drives. Are you seeing typical seasonality from your enterprise customers? Or is it better or worse start to the year?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, in general, what we expect for the March quarter, flat to slightly up. But again, if you look at this in the midterm, the capacity enterprise is what we believe is going to grow double-digit and the performance enterprise is more growing with the GDP at a lower rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The first is on pricing. Within the guidance you've provided for the March quarter, could you talk specifically about what your expectations are for pricing. And then more importantly, as to extend Ananda's question, as you're thinking about the next couple of quarters, how are you thinking all the various forces will impact your pricing assumptions?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. Like-for-like modest declines. It's still a competitive market. Our absolute price will be impacted by segment mix, and then going forward, it's a little bit tough to tell. I mean, we're looking at where we are as it relates to our business model and we're committed to be in the 27% to 32% range and that will govern our pricing.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, any responses -- Seagate specifically talked about pricing. They think it could indeed be flat sequentially for the next couple of quarters. Any reaction to those comments, specifically?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, I mean, you have to ask Seagate about that. I mean, obviously, we're trying to manage all the variables that we have, including pricing, to continue to improve our overall business performance and that sort of thing. We factored in some assumptions in terms of what will happen, and we'll have to see how that plays out in terms of how we move through the quarter, but I'm not going to comment specifically on Seagate's pricing.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Then more broadly my follow-up question, if I could, is you provided gross margin color for the near term March quarter. Could you just help us think about as you look, say, the June quarter or even within the March quarter, what are the -- outside of the pricing, what are the key areas that we should be really focused on or that you guys were focused on between mix and restructuring at Hitachi and the demand that would impact the gross margin to keep within the range that you've talked about?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, I think that there are a few key things. I mean, first off, we will be very careful about what business we take and what business we don't take and that sort of thing, so being selective within reason with regards to that. The other thing is to continue to manage our operations very closely from a cost and efficiency perspective and then particularly continuing to make improvements there. That's a very big opportunity for us across the board. And then the last thing which is what benefited this quarter is to continue to push our mix, both in terms of the capacity mix that we're shipping and selling but also in terms of the segment mix that we have overall. And again we do believe that the secular trends in that regard are moving in a positive direction. So we've got a little bit of wind at our back, if you want to call it that, in regards to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insight Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","So in the industry segment detail that you gave us, looks like the enterprise hard drive segment increased about 15% Q-over-Q and your own enterprise hard drives increased 11% Q-over-Q. So can you just discuss what was the driver for the underperformance relative to the industry. And if possible, can you give us some additional detail on a subsegment basis on the relative performance. And I have another question about the Arkeia acquisition.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, on the enterprise, and we gave you rough numbers. Our enterprise market participation was as expected. There's always a little puts and takes, but our share is more or less flattish quarter-over-quarter.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Okay. All right. So this Arkeia acquisition looks like a nice acquisition that can build some value in the SMB segment and start to blur the lines at some of your enterprise customers. But in order to successfully do that, I think that you're going to have to build the brand value of Arkeia. So is that the intention of that acquisition? And if it is, can you discuss the investment that Western Digital is willing to make in order to build that value, that brand value, to realize full potential of this acquisition?","Stephen D. Milligan","First off, it was not a significant acquisition from a dollar amount perspective, but it does add the building block to our product capability in the SMB market and so really what we're trying to do is continue to improve our offering. And obviously, as we improve our offering, we're going to have to make other investments, prudent investments, to increase our presence in that marketplace. But this is -- we're just continuing to take it a step at a time in terms of enhancing our competitive position in that marketplace.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.","Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Eric Sterling for Ben Reitzes. In light of your expectations for demand in the first half of the calendar year, are you backing away from the $10 EPS target that you had put out earlier in the year?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's a good -- that's a safe assumption, yes. I mean, we expect the $10 EPS target in the July time frame and at that time we were anticipating what we thought was -- frankly, was conservative for 5% growth in the market, which would have gotten you to some 630 million for the fiscal year. And when you do the math now based on what I -- what Steve said earlier, we'll probably land somewhere on 550 million, that's a very, very significant reduction in volume. What we have achieved with everything else was the product offering we achieved the gross margin models. But with a TAM that low, it's unrealistic and you can do the math, what we would have to achieve in Q4 so we don't think that's realistic anymore.","Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And in terms of buybacks for the March quarter, how should we think about that?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's just -- we're executing to our capital allocation strategy which, as a reminder, called for 50% of the free cash flow to be spent on share buybacks and dividends, and we're going to execute into those metrics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Cihra from Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I could. One, Steve, you had talked about the visibility getting better now that inventories have been worked down, which makes sense because at least you get a truer view in the demand. But can you talk about your OEM customer visibility? My sense is that they don't normally have a lot of visibility this time of the year, and that this year it may even be worse than usual. I mean, do you get a sense that they have any visibility past, say, February. And are your comments of visibility actually implying that maybe their visibility is starting to get a little better here too or where do they look. And then separate from that, just a question on branded, your branded business is getting back to where it was pre-flood. You said inventories were lean there. Wondering if you're still sort of catching up, if you've caught up? And what do we need to see to get that market back to being a good growth market like it had been pre-flood?","Stephen D. Milligan","I think it's difficult for me to comment specifically on the customers have better visibility. I mean, the reality of things from a customer perspective is that there's still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, conservatism, if you want to call it that. I mean, it's been a tough year and there's a lot of transitions going on but I think that -- and obviously there are, and this is always true, but maybe particularly given now there's always winners and losers, if you want to call it that, and so depends upon who you talk to and their level of confidence. But I think when we evaluate demand, we obviously don't, and no disrespect to our customers, we don't just listen to our customers. There's lots of things we triangulate to try to get a sense for where we think things are going to fall out. And it's those things, coupled with conversations with customers and to your point, the easing of the inventory overhang that gives us increased visibility and confidence with regards to how we see things playing out.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","And I can answer the branded question. I mean, last quarter, the market for branded was higher than pre-flood. So that market was totally recovered and if you recall from our September Analyst Day and Investor Day, branded is clearly one of the areas along with capacity enterprise where we believe we will see solid growth for the coming years, both on the DAS and the NAS side and that's driven by the desire and need to backup and, it's also driven by the data growth in general.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller of Noble Financial Capital Market.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","One thing that you seem to be a doing a very good job on is keeping your markets up, ASPs were flat this quarter, the channel has also been lean as you noted. Is there reason to believe there are other factors just besides behaving well in terms of internal cost cuts and reducing your cost per prime unit that will also support higher margins in 2013? I know they went up significantly after the acquisition of Hitachi, but there were a lot of moving parts there with the flood, and I was expecting I think you said we can't expect that to come down.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, I think, Mark, just to kind of comment on that, there's always multiple levers that we have to influence our business outcome. And I know that a lot of times the market, and I'm referring to, call it, Wall Street in this case, will focused on one particular variable or what have you or whether it be demand, or it be pricing data points that are out there and say, well, you know, margins must be going down or this creates this kind of problem. And we obviously have a very holistic way in terms of the way that we manage our business and a lot of levers that we can pull, including improving our cost, improving our mix. The selection of what business we accept or don't accept with our customers and then obviously pricing. So there's lots of different things that we can do. And to your indication or to your point, we do believe that we've done a reasonably good job, and that's reflected in our gross margin performance and not only that, our guidance, and we expect to continue to do that going forward. And that's why we've stated the fact that we're confident that we're going to continue to stay within this gross margin range of 27 to 32, and that it's not just a set of aspirational goals. It's the way that we're going to manage the business.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Because of the flood, your competitor signed up a number of its customers to long-term agreements, and it seems to me a lot of these agreements should be patiently done with. And I'm just wondering are these agreements expiring or are there opportunities for you as these agreements expire or these agreements are still -- some of these agreements are extending well into 2013?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, just to correct one thing, Mark. We did not sign or have a lot of -- we didn't have any meaningful, if you want to call it, LTAs with our customers. So this is based upon -- there's no contractual lockup, if you want to call it here, that's compelling our customers to pay us higher prices than otherwise they would desire. This is just good old hard work in the way that we're dealing with our customers and how we're managing our business.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Well my point was more with your competitor, which had stated...","Stephen D. Milligan","I'm sorry, with our competitor. Yes, I mean, those have been expired. We don't have all the details, but they've been expiring over time and you'd have to ask Seagate more details about it.","All right, I'd like to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance and our customers and our suppliers for their support.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Bob Blair","Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth in the storage industry, hard-drive demand from the September quarter and fiscal '13 and our financial results expectations for the September quarter and fiscal '13.

[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.","I'll now turn the call over to Western Digital's Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.","John F. Coyne","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl.","To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings.","Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows.","In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors: We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and a modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%.","We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers' continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure, by ramping newer areal density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and the recovery from flood-related cost issues.","Taking all this into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13.","Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe: In entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments in faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance.","Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?","Stephen D. Milligan","Thanks, John. When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point.","Both WD and HGST have a heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business.","We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8  billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their build plans to the prevailing demand environment.","We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million terabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market; 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop; 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications; and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units including solid state drives, media players and routers.","It is worth noting that our aggregate shipments of nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrates continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space.","As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post-flood downturn with exciting new products.","On the operations front, WD began production in its new slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and both subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels.","It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers including some important new market entries:  Specifically, the WD branded products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless home networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD 2go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration.","On the component side, WD introduced its WD Red series, the industry's first hard drives specifically designed for home and small office NAS systems.","To address demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first-mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of these particular drives have shipped since product inception.","Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated the industry's first 12 gigabit per second SAS solid state drive.","In a departure from Western Digital's long-standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan on providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter.","The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance.","OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx versus our guidance reflect higher attainments on our variable compensation program.","In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance.","Net interest and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains on  investments.","Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income.","Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditures.","Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory, or 11 turns, and 77 days payables.","Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 totaled $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million.","During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares.","As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases.","We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars results in a net cash balance of $1 billion.","I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter: We expect TAM to be flat with the prior quarter; revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion; gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba; R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles, as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 253 million.","Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question. As we think about the $10 number that you're now throwing around out there and you talk about the lack of synergies due to the MOFCOM regulatory requirements, relative to your $550 million OpEx guide that you've laid out, can you help us understand what that $10 number reflects as far as how we should think about the OpEx without any synergies in the model? Put another way, is $550 million the high watermark, is that how we should model kind of quarterly OpEx to get to that $10 number?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Aaron, let me give you a bit more context and summarize what we said. The base assumption is a market that's growing approximately 5% from a unit volume perspective. We anticipate our share to be roughly flat in the fiscal year. From an OpEx perspective, like John and I mentioned, we do not expect synergies when compared with the current level of OpEx, might be up or down a little bit. But in average, you should assume what we guided for in Q1. As it relates to the tax rate, I think the 8.5% that we gave you for Q1 is probably a good proxy for the year as well. We're planning to change our approach to share repurchases, where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases. And when you compute all these numbers together, you're coming to a gross margin that's roughly about 30%, give or take. So those are the major assumptions. But from an OpEx perspective, you should assume the OpEx to be roughly flat with what we guided for.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow up, if my math is correct, it looks like you guys were averaged blended capacity per drive of roughly 150 gigabytes. Can you talk about that relative to where that compares to the overall industry. Are you back to normal or is there a little bit more to come as far as returning back to a normal industry average capacity per drive perspective?","John F. Coyne","Well, the number was actually 681.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, my math's wrong.","John F. Coyne","Okay. And that is pretty much back into industry mix.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","In terms of just understanding then your ability to produce using your own heads, John, are you where you want to be internally or do you think that it will be a couple more quarters? You said, you brought the Malaysian facility online, but is it back to where you want in terms of an internal versus external mix?","Stephen D. Milligan","I think -- Rich, I'll take that. This is Steve. But I think that -- we've obviously got different fosters, if you want to call it that, depending upon which subsidiary you're talking about. HGST has filed with a model of whether it will be 80%, 90% internal, 10%, 20% external purchases. WD has got kind of a similar model.  Obviously, that became overweighted in terms of the recovery from the flood. And as John and Wolfgang alluded to, we've still got a variety of different things that we need to do as an organization to get to pre-flood kind of levels from a cost perspective. And certainly returning to that kind of blend will be something that we'll be looking to do as we progress into the future.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just, Wolfgang, in terms of the Toshiba comment about the drag on gross margins, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how that works. Are you not allowed to get a margin like a contract manufacturer would on the drives or why would there be a drag per se?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, you're right, Rich. There is, for a certain period of time, certainty this quarter, a little bit what's included in the last quarter as well and then probably the December, March quarter, as well as we transition the 3.5-inch equipment over to Toshiba, we are building drives for them on a contract manufacturer margin basis and that is dilutive on, as I said, in the quarter. We just ended at about 50 basis points.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","But the units are included in your total unit number or no?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","No.","Stephen D. Milligan","No. Because we don't want to double count them with Toshiba, right? As they ship them through.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly, relative to all the noise that was kind of going on in the channel, you said -- or going on the sell side about the channel, you said that your shipments were actually linear to the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in the channel and was there really 30% plus week-on-week inventory changes? Can you just talk about what was really going on in the channel in June.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, we don't recognize any of those numbers, and in fact, our channel inventories continue to be below 4-week level.","Operator","Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a clarification and a question. Did you say that Toshiba was coming out of the gross margins, the 30% guidance that was excluded?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's correct. In a different number of the Toshiba effect is included.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Then my question is when you think about your guidance for $10, you indicated that your share is roughly flat. So I wanted to just hear your reaction to some of the comments Toshiba's made and specifically indicating that it wants to grow its share and is willing to invest both directly and indirectly. How do we reconcile those statements, because I assume that Seagate is going to want to keep its share. How do we reconcile those statements?","John F. Coyne","This is John. Market share is a reflection of the extent of how we delight our customers on a consistent and continuous basis. We earn market share on a daily basis as we execute a strength, long-term strength, of WD and an exhibited strength of HGST in the past several years has been providing the right products in the right way at the right time with the right value proposition to customers. And we believe we can continue to earn that share of business in a competitive marketplace throughout the upcoming year and we're modeling our business on that basis.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, I'll ask one last one then I'll certainly yield the floor. In terms of the unit growth -- thanks for that perspective on guidance. Is there any calibration point that you could offer on what you think general pricing trends will be over that same period? And that's it for me.","Stephen D. Milligan","I think that pricing is always one of the more difficult variables to predict in our business. And so we're going to continue to expect it to be, I'll call it, a competitive business. But I think that what -- there's a recognition from our standpoint when we look at pricing that, as John alluded to, there are a number of different factors that are impacting demand. One of the things that is not impacting demand, from our perspective, is the level of disk drive pricing, right? And there's arguably no reason to go and just transfer dollars to not create any elasticity. Right? And so we'll continue to provide the appropriate value to our customers, which includes, yes, you have to make adjustments in your pricing, but we're going to do that in a prudent fashion that ultimately allows for value creation not only from our perspective but also value creation for our customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","I have 2 questions. One, can you first review what the shipments were for the industry segments? And I have a follow-on question. Not for WD specifically.","John F. Coyne","You're looking for total industry, yes.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Yes.","Stephen D. Milligan","Wolfgang is digging it out.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I can give you a flavor there, it was a total of 157 million units, as John said. We're about 82 million, 2.5-inch drive; 65 million, 3.5-inch drives; ATA that were about 17 -- they were about 9 million performance enterprise drives and then there were a few 1.8-inch that were shipped.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Okay. So given the performance of the nearline drives and the performance of the client drives, can you talk about what your understanding is of the potential for a cannibalization of, say, a tablet without a hard drive to be transferred into a nearline cloud drive. Is there an application? Is there a one-to-one transfer? Is it a little bit less than that? Can you discuss that?","Stephen D. Milligan","I'm not quite sure I follow your question. Can you kind of clarify that a bit?","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Yes. Essentially, when a client drive is speced with a solid state drive instead of a hard drive. Do you see any sort of data that indicates that, that hard drive that has been displaced with a much lower capacity solid state drive that, that capacity is being transferred into a cloud-based drive given the industry data that you're seeing here.","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, I mean, that's a hard question to answer in a real simple way. I mean, I think what we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it \"the hard drive industry,\" but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increase in data, right? And so, undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we, we being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the, on the HGST side, in terms of the tiering types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing some level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increased participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations, right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business, is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that, right now, both the WD sub and HGST sub have, that's being coupled up in some cases with solid-state, a dual drive configuration, that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get instant on whatever it might happen to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is, is that all of this data growth is a good thing for all of us, and that what we've got to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, the right level of products, interact with our customers in the right way, to continue to bring different solutions that address all these different applications. And so, it's actually, I think we're very optimistic in terms of our ability to be able to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve, nice to have you on an earnings call again. I wanted to ask about the MOFCOM details that you talked about last quarter. I think you had hoped to get some concessions from MOFCOM in terms of pieces of the business that you could combine versus pieces of the business you obviously couldn't combine over the next couple of years. Could you give us an update on any progress you've made there.","John F. Coyne","Our conclusion that we will continue to operate the businesses as separate subsidiaries at least through the 2-year initial remedy requirement under MOFCOM and our expectation that we will not achieve measurable synergies in the OpEx environment, that gives you an update on where we are in clarification of the understanding between ourselves and MOFCOM as to how we will operate during the 2-year restriction period.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then now that we're seeing some additional revenue coming from other segments like SSD and you've also mentioned the Toshiba business, which will be in for a couple of quarters, will you be breaking out a non-HDD revenue number? Did you give that this quarter and will you be giving that going forward?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","We haven't decided yet. We're not spelling it out for this quarter beyond what Steve mentioned that it was a 1 million unit in shipments.","Stephen D. Milligan","Hopefully, well, because we want it to be big enough so that we'll have to.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This seems like it's impacting the ASP [ph] a little bit in terms of the calculation. So it will be helpful.","Operator","Next question we have from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if Steve could refresh our memory in terms of what enterprise shipments were by HGST in the year-ago period.","Stephen D. Milligan","You know, Mark, I honestly don't know. And so I don't have the specific number in front of me. But I can tell you and we've been very fortunate with, and I'm speaking now in the HGST side of being able to meaningfully improve our market position in the enterprise base, both in terms of traditional performance enterprise, as well as capacity enterprise and certainly something that we're very pleased with. And we want to maintain that position. We want to improve that position. We want to continue to deepen our relationships from the customer perspective. And so I apologize for not having that specific number in front of me. But I do know that it has improved rather markedly over the last 12 months.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Your cost of goods sold per drive unit remains high, but some of that's flood effect. And I'm just wondering how much of a upside in terms of continued strong margins, is that going to be significant next year? Are you going to be able to significantly pull those costs down?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","You're right. In the Q4 numbers that we just reported there was for both subs, but in particular for the WD sub, that was mostly impacted by the flood. There was a sort of significant cost disadvantage when compared with pre-flood levels and that has to do with absorption, that has to do with higher external content, that has to do with freight modes that we use and other things, and you should assume that it's a significant opportunity going forward and that we will walk ourselves through that over the next couple of quarters.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Certainly doesn't appear so, but your competitor announced significant component supply issues or problems, it doesn't look like you had any problem. You were able to navigate that issue, is that correct?","John F. Coyne","Yes, we haven't. There's always occasional this, that and the other thing, but nothing significant.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And the supply components of the channel, is that basically back to pre-flood levels or are there any bottlenecks or anything like that in the channel?","John F. Coyne","I think we're pretty much, both in terms of the mix and quantity of drives, that we're in a position to make available to our customers, matches their needs and the component landscape is appropriate to support both plans.","Operator","Next comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Actually, I'd like to follow-up with more color. You did mention that there's -- it sounds like about 3 quarters worth of additional cost benefit to work off. I mean, I'm just wondering if you can give us more color in terms of things like, are you still sending things airfreight? At what point do you think you'll be back to that mix of internal versus external heads? How much of the cost increase that we have seen do you think is a more lasting effect versus how much do you think might be worked off, and even a range that you might be able to give us over the next few quarters will be great?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Like I said, I think we'll walk ourselves through everything by the end of the new fiscal year. Some of it is solvable more immediate like the freight mode and some of it like the component mix will take a little bit longer. We said we had multi-quarter agreements there. So it's a gradual improvement throughout the fiscal year.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And can you give us a sense for how much -- there's been discussion also that some of the cost increases will be permanent because the supply chain will be more diversified? Can you give us a sense for how much we might think about that in terms of the cost?","John F. Coyne","I think we've previously indicated that we expected the impact of that to be $1 to $2 a drive over the long haul in terms of that change in model for the business in terms of change in concentration model and the need to continue to invest in substantial incremental technology right throughout the supply chain as we move forward and address the challenges of delivering areal density on into the future.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And then can you comment in terms of getting your production back online? Are you completely requalified on everything with all your customers? Has there been any sort of shift? I know one of your suppliers was talking months ago that there's going to be a big shift in areal density in the new equipment that was brought back up and the new process was brought back up. Is there more to go there or is that pretty much behind you as you brought the new capacity back up to the level it's at?","Stephen D. Milligan","That's pretty much all behind us thanks.","Operator","Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to see if we can go back to ASPs. Just to give us a kind of a better understanding of some of the puts and takes. Because I imagine that the blended ASP benefited from a higher mix of enterprise drives this quarter, just given the contribution of growth from a unit perspective from the enterprise. So I wanted to understand that. And then the second part to that question is really about the ASP takedowns that you kind of telegraphed during the last earnings call. Were they kind of inline with your expectations? Were they more severe or less severe, and how should we think about that going into September quarter?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Let me add a few points on that. First of all, to put the LTA that we mentioned, those are all done. There were certain short term agreements. Those are all behind us. The second thing that's important to point out and that we alluded to is that WD as a response to the -- with significant impact to the flood, had increased the prices to the highest level, and we believe in Q1 has clearly met the [indiscernible] on OEM pricing again. Last quarter, pricing actually came in better than expected. You see that with the major impact of our overachieving of the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing. In the flood, the spot markets increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like Steve said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to sub 4 weeks and that includes in transit. But we were able to maintain that spread between the markets a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter. For Q1, implied in our guidance is a mix. Obviously, it includes now our position in the market and enterprise drives. It has our subsidiaries at market pricing for OEMs. And it assumes that the distribution pricing gets into the normal range to the OEM pricing.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes and Mark, this is Steve. Let me add a little bit of a perspective, which I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. But I've been away from the earnings kind of stuff a little bit, but I think it's important that we -- one of the things generally technology prices come down over time, right? And so we are going to have a price declines and it's important. And we have to remind ourselves in terms of how we manage the business to do the same that you not become overly fixated on one particular data point or element of our business. And so we deal with price declines all the time. The question is rate and pace. And then the other thing is that, what we do need to deal with that? How do we manage our cost? How do we manage our mix? How do we introduce new products? How do we find other ways to add values to our customer? And at the end of the day, ultimately, it's our job to figure out how to factor that all in and deliver not only satisfactory products to our customers but a compelling return to our shareholders.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And my other question here is around Apple investments. Wolfgang, has there been any change in terms of the CapEx strategy as you go into fiscal 2013?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, a few points there. First of all, you might have noticed that we came in a bit below what we said in the March quarter. We said 7 -- sorry, what we said in the May call. We said we'll be about 750. We came out at 717. We do also expect that we will not spend the full recovery capital that we indicated of 650 now because obviously, we're not bringing the capacity back to the same level. We earmarked that number at about $400 million as opposed to the $650 million. And for fiscal '13, our capital expenditure number will largely depend on what -- towards the end of the fiscal year, we expect the demand to be for [indiscernible] . But in general, you should assume that our capital spending for the fiscal year will be below the 7% to 8% that we guided to historically.","Operator","Next comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Wolfgang, was just wondering you made mention on the call the aerial density ramps in coming quarters. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And, along with that, can you give us an update on when we should expect the ramp of single platter drives and where you are with that now? And anything else on the mix perspective that might service that tailwind to the gross margins going forward.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So let me take that question. So from a technology perspective, there's a few kind of key  things that we're really focused on. The first thing is, and you alluded to it, is ramping to more competitive levels or cost competitive levels. The new areal density points whether that's a 500-gigabyte per platter on a 2.5-inch platform and then a terabyte for a 3.5-inch. And so our development teams, our respective development teams, are aggressively working on that ramp and we'll continue to see that transition. I mean, it is already actively in process, but we'll continue to see that occur over the course of this fiscal year. And then the maturity benefits of that from a cost perspective as we improve yields, et cetera. And so that's obviously a key area that we're focused on. The other thing is that, and we've already sort of alluded to this, but we want to continue to make sure that were investing from a product perspective on the opportunities that we see in terms of thin and light applications, whether that be in Ultrabooks or it be in Slimbooks, whatever you want to call them, where we think that we have the ability to continue to package drives in an effective way that allows us to ship into thinner devices. And then additionally, we want to continue the progress that we've made on the enterprise front. And so we're going to continue to invest meaningful dollars in expanding and improving our product portfolio in both subsidiaries so that we can continue to -- and to maintain our momentum, shall we say, in the enterprise area. And then, of course, lastly, is that we'll continue to invest in advanced areal density technologies whether that be shingle write or heat assist or energy assist, whatever you prefer calling. So those are really our priorities from a technology perspective.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess the follow-up is, Wolfgang, I think the word you used or the context you used on buyback that you would you move to be more methodical as opposed to opportunistic? And with the stock word in that, can you give us some sense of how opportunistic you may be willing to be versus methodical or what really we should take away from methodical?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Let me just say this. I mean, we got a significant increase in authorization. We took the opportunity to buy shares last quarter. We will be more systematic rather than opportunistic. We'll talk more to you at our September meeting about the exact details of the capital allocation strategy and I will leave at that for now.","John F. Coyne","And thank you all for your participation in today's call. I'm very pleased with Western Digital's performance in fiscal '12, extending our 10-year record of compound annual revenue and EPS growth, the 19% and 48%, respectively. I'm excited to have such a strong and accomplished leadership team focused on the strategic development of our business to extend this long-term performance into the years ahead.

Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","I also want to mention that we are aware that there has been some -- a technical issue with accessing our investor summary posted on our Investor website, and that's in the process right now, being addressed and taken care of. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question in the Q&A session today. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor's section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.","I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.","Stephen Milligan","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our December quarter results and our outlook for the March quarter. We executed well in the December quarter, as we continue to participate in the ongoing growth of data in all of our served markets. The industry TAM was slightly higher than anticipated, driven by seasonal demand. We saw strength in gaming and branded products.","We exceeded our expectations on revenue, gross margin and earnings per share in the December quarter, and our cash generation remained strong. The consistency in our financial performance reflects the reduced volatility in our business.","We continue to be very excited about our unique position in the storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on the dramatic changes that are underway. We serve very large markets, underpinned by strong data growth prospects. It is clear to us, that most of the world's data will be stored on hard drives and enterprise-class solid state drives in tiered architectures, as companies and consumers seek to optimize performance. Strategically, we are well positioned to play a leadership role, by innovating and collaborating with our customers to define the future digital data landscape.","Total exabytes shipped and average gigabytes per drive continued to grow, reflecting strong customer response to our enterprise and branded products. These are two growing businesses, where we have established leadership position. Continued success in these markets offers us the opportunity to achieve even better financial results over time, as we add more and more value to our solutions.","As data becomes more strategic in the enterprise, companies are investing differently in IT infrastructure, looking to achieve optimal total cost of ownership. This is resulting in more fragmented solutions, allowing for more customization, and value creation by storage providers. These trends are helping to drive the upward trajectory in our cloud-related revenue.","Over the last few months, customers have responded positively to two of our newest products, addressing the demand for innovative solutions in the personal, public and private clouds. Specifically, we launched the WD My Cloud, a comprehensive personal cloud solution for users to organize, centralize and secure their digital content, and access it from anywhere in the world. This is an important element of our Connected Life initiative to improve the connectivity of the home.","We launched our 6-terabyte helium-based sealed drive, which leverages our proprietary technology platform called HelioSeal. Select strategic customers have already qualified the drive, and we are shipping the product.","We have also seen continued customer preference for our portfolio of enterprise class solid state drives. In the December quarter, our SSD enterprise revenue outpaced the growth rate in the overall SSD enterprise market, as we continue to integrate our recently acquired talent and technology into the HGST-SSD organization.","We are excited about the year ahead, tempered by the industry's usual seasonality in the first half of the year. We see several potential drivers for a better demand environment, including prospects for an improving global economy, a stabilizing PC market, and ongoing investments in both the traditional and capacity enterprise markets.","I will now turn the call over to Tim Leyden.","Timothy Leyden","Thank you, Steve. Our strong December quarter performance, benefited from solid market demand, favorable channel and business mix, and continuing good execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 142 million units during the December quarter, up from the September quarter and the year-ago period, and the TAM came in slightly higher than the guidance we gave on our October call. In our business, we saw strength in gaming, consistent quarter-over-quarter performance in clients and enterprise, and the anticipated seasonal pick-up in branded products.","Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean. Our revenue for the December quarter was $4 billion, including $155 million from enterprise SSDs. While we expect our enterprise SSD revenue growth rate to continue to exceed that of the industry, the upward trajectory in the December quarter was especially strong, given a single source opportunity. Overall, 54% of our revenue came from non-PC applications.","We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP, was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick in branded products and strength in distribution.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.7%; non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%, excluding $40 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $15 million of restructuring charges. We exceeded our implied guidance from non-GAAP gross margin by 30 basis points, primarily due to favorable business mix.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $650 million for the December quarter. SG&A included the following items: $12 million of charges related to certain litigation, $11 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, and $6 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $5 million of restructuring charges. As a reminder, the previous period included a flood-related insurance recovery of $65 million.","We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the December quarter, relating to the Seagate arbitration matter. Tax expense for the December quarter was $37 million or 8% of pre-tax income. Our net income for the December quarter totaled $430 million or $1.77 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $532 million, or $2.19 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet; we generated $727 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $557 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $170 million, or 4% of revenue. As part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2 million shares for $150 million during the December quarter. We also declared dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share. We exited Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which approximately $700 million was in the US.","I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down, and in a range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion, reflecting the seasonally lower TAM. Gross margin, approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles, reflecting the impact of lower factory utilization due to lower volumes. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8% and the share count of approximately 243 million.","Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.90 for the March quarter, which includes a dilution impact of $0.10 from the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015.","Overall, we are pleased with our continued strong performance. We are enthusiastic about our prospects to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first quarter comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Hey good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Stephen Milligan","Yes.","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","How would you characterize the compute and enterprise market versus your original expectations in December? And then can you just talk about, in each of those segments, what you think seasonality will look like in the first quarter, and you mentioned potential upticks as the economies improve, when would you expect to see the better seasonality off of the macro recovery? Thanks.","Stephen Milligan","Sure Katie. Couple of comments. In terms of the quarter, the past quarter, so calendar Q4; for the most part, it really kind of played out to the way that we expected it. Enterprise really sort of came in, both in terms of the performance enterprise and capacity enterprise, more or less turned out the way that we expected it, where we saw a little bit more strength was the notebook business or 2.5 inch client business was may be a bit stronger than what we expected it to be.","Also, the gaming market, gaming business was certainly stronger than what we expected. The new gaming consoles appeared to be -- consumers appeared to be responding to them very favorably, and that's encouraging to us, we are glad to see that; and again, I think the branded products business was seasonally stronger. And so really things played out very consistently to our expectation, with a bit more strength in gaming and a bit more strength in the notebook business.","Now, in terms of how things are going to play out in 2014, a little bit hard to say, frankly. One of the things that we are seeing right now, because we haven't seen it frankly for several years, is we are seeing seasonality return a bit. If you go back in time, we've had various things that impacted seasonality. We have had earthquake in Japan, we have had floods in Thailand, we have had other kinds of situations that have -- may be masked from our perspective, traditional seasonality in our business. So if you look at this quarter, the March quarter, PCs traditionally are down about 10%. So we are looking at a TAM reduction of probably in the 5% to 7%, may be 8% level.","One of the things that is making things a little bit difficult from a clarity perspective, is that Chinese New Year is a bit earlier this year. So what we are seeing some of our customers do in the PC space is, do a bit of build-ahead in anticipation of the Chinese New Year shutdown, and then we will have to see how demand picks up after that.","So that's just a bit of color in terms of what we are seeing from a demand environment perspective.","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","And then, just as a follow-up, there was margin upside this quarter even without enterprise upside, what would it take to get margins up into the 30% to 32% sustainably? What do you need to see over the next four quarters, for that type of margin upside?","Stephen Milligan","To answer that question in kind of a generic way; we are going to have to continue to do, which is really what -- we are really trying to do all the time, is continue to add more value from a customer perspective; and we do think that as we do that, there is an opportunity for us to see our margins creep up a bit. I mean, that's really what we have been doing. Obviously we are going to continue to do the things that historically we have done, which I will call it the normal blocking and tackling, managing our mix, managing our costs effectively, and so -- but really, what we've got to do, is continue to add more value from a product perspective.","The other thing is, is that specifically as it relates to our enterprise SSD business and some of the acquisitions that we made there, we need to continue to ramp those, which is coming along nicely, and as we do that, and as we see that become a more material part of our business, that should contribute favorably to our gross margin structure going forward.","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham. Your line is open.","Richard Kugele - Needham and Company","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a few questions for me. I guess first, let's talk about the SSD side a little bit. Do you see the operating structure of the now combined entity appropriately sized and the accretion that's at early calendar 2015 is driven by just revenue growth, or do you have some operational changes that you are trying to make as well? Just trying to understand the puts and takes that gets you from here, with $0.10 dilution to the accretion?","Stephen Milligan","Rich, I think there is a couple of different factors. I mean, one, we are still in the process of making sure that we optimize the organization, both from a pure headcount perspective, as well as making sure that we have got the right mix of employees, and so that process is ongoing, and we continue to do that, but the main thing that we need to do in order to realize that accretion in 2015, is continue to ramp our revenue appropriately, with the appropriate product set.","Richard Kugele - Needham and Company","Okay. Then secondly, just looking at obviously Xyratex taken out by Seagate. Can you just comment on your view of testers and gate relationship with Teradyne?","Stephen Milligan","Yeah. So really couple of things. It's a little bit hard to respond to that, specifically at this point Rich, because Seagate has, to my knowledge, made no specific comment externally in terms of what their plans are, with the Xyratex organization, and more specifically, as it relates to their tester business. That being said, we are obviously looking at various different ways that we can manage any potential impact that might occur, related to that transaction, and part of that has to do with our relationship with Teradyne.","Richard Kugele - Needham and Company","Certainly, I guess then from your manufacturing footprint today, you feel comfortable you have enough flexibility in your testing capacity?","Stephen Milligan","Yes.","Richard Kugele - Needham and Company","Okay. Then lastly, because I have been asked the question, many disruptions from the unrest in Thailand. I know, you guys have been there very-very long time, and are seeing these things from time to time, but this could have been asked?","Stephen Milligan","Yeah, and no disruption, and we are obviously monitoring the situation very-very closely. One of our primary things, is to continue to make sure that our facilities and employees are safe, and the disruptions have been occurring in about the center of Bangkok. Our facilities, we have two primary facilities in Thailand that are pretty well outside the Bangkok area, but we do have employees that are located and so we are making sure that we have got appropriate transportation for them, and that sort of thing, so that our facilities and our employees are protected. And we certainly, to your point -- Rich, we have seen this before. We don't -- we continue to take it seriously, because it could become more volatile, so we got to keep a close eye on it. But we clearly have a number of different contingency plans in place to make sure that we can work through various different situations, to ensure appropriate supply to our customers, and protection of our employees.","Richard Kugele - Needham and Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first question for me is, just to go into the free cash flow generation. You have been very consistently north of $2 billion in free cash flow, but one of the things that's interesting is your cash conversion cycle is notably above your four to eight day target range, which is reiterated in the material today. So just curious, how you are thinking about free cash flow generation as we look forward, and kind of tying that back to, how do we get from a 19-day cash conversion cycle, down to that four to eight day range, if that's your stated target?","Timothy Leyden","Yes, this is Tim. We have got opportunity in inventory, definitely and we have actually been in transition a little bit, because we got a higher percentage of our total business, which is now enterprise driven. So consequently, that does place a little bit of pressure on inventory. In addition to that, we have been utilizing finished goods for two purposes, first of all to smooth out some of the linearity challenges, because we are making choices to take spikes out of the production, and to build ahead, where necessary, and to carry a little bit extra inventory, that's one particular item from an inventory viewpoint.","Secondly, we have also been making choices to put more inventory on the ocean, to help our cost of goods sold. So we are working the inventory pretty much, in order to get to optimum positions, and I think we have got some room there.","In terms of DSOs, we got worse on DSOs quarter-on-quarter, and that's driven a little bit by the peculiar linearity in the December quarter; because -- Steve already mentioned that the timing of Chinese New Year in the current quarter, the early timing of it, was driving some different behavior by customers. But the timing of the Christmas period was also an issue. So consequently, what we saw a little lighter linearity in the October timeframe, and a bit stronger linearity in the November timeframe. So consequently, we had to carry a couple of more days, DSOs, as a result of that.","And our four to eight, we are going to reevaluate it, because I do think that there were some differences in our business that now have to be dealt with, and we are going to have to reevaluate if the four to eight is really appropriate. But we certainly got opportunity there in order to be able to generate more cash, and of course, we got to keep the profitability and Steve talked a little bit about also about driving higher gross margin, higher ROC and that would help us also to continue to generate -- strong cash generation that we have been seeing for eight quarters now, in excess of $500 million.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, great.","Stephen Milligan","And just to add one comment to that, just quickly. Absent Tim's comment in terms of -- because we are evaluating whether or not the four to eight makes sense, given different dynamics in our business, which I think is -- which is obviously appropriate. The other thing is, is that, there is no way that we are going to get within that range, under the whole separate arrangement. The whole separate arrangement continues to drive inefficiencies in our business from a financial perspective, which we obviously believe, translates to value that we can provide to our customers, and so we will be looking for an opportunity to request that that be lifted in March, and that should help us address some of this as well.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. As a quick follow-up I'd just like to understand, as you think about the SSD business growing and kind of growing to your model, so first of all, what was the dilutive impact that we recognized in the December quarter? Do you still see a $0.20 dilution in total for fiscal 2015, and how do we think about that business ramping in the context of gross margin flowing, on a consolidated P&L?","Timothy Leyden","On a quarterly basis, it's a dilution of about $0.10 per quarter, and from a gross margin viewpoint, we measure that business on basis of ROIC and it's at the high end of our ROIC range.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Hi guys. I wanted to go back to TAM for a second. Last year in March, at this same conference call, you guided revenues for the March quarter to be down, four to six I believe it was; revenues end up coming down sequentially about 2%, and the TAM was relatively flattish. So to Katie's question, I think you intimated that the TAM would be, in the low 130 range, 133, 135. I understand Chinese New Year is a few weeks earlier this year than last. But what's really the difference on how you are thinking about the TAM this year, versus last year? Because it seems like a pretty big drop-off, or is there certainly some element of conservatism in there?","Stephen Milligan","Let me comment on that. Really, the dynamics that we are seeing, just to kind of oversimplify it, is it's primarily related to the PC market. And I know there has been a lot of commentary or speculation in terms of what's happening in the PC market. Let me give you our perspective on that.","We have seen the PC market, I will call it, begin to stabilize. Obviously, the PC market still shrunk in calendar Q4, and so, it's less bad than what it used to be. However, there is still a fair amount of cautiousness on behalf of our customers, in terms of what the demand environment is going to look like, in terms of the first half calendar 2014. That cautiousness is factored into the guidance that we have provided. And not only that, the visibility that our customers have, is a bit -- I mean, in terms of demand environment, they're just very cautious.","Now that being said, I think, one very important point is that our customers in my view, in our visibility or knowledge of the PC channel, inventory is the best we know it, it's in very-very healthy shape. In other words, what I mean by that, is --","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Gambling.","Stephen Milligan","And so that's very good. So if there does happen to be, at this time, an unanticipated pickup in PC demand, that's not reflected in our numbers, obviously that will translate to upside to our numbers, in the March quarter. There is still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, Keith.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you. Then my follow-up, perhaps if you can lay out as best you can, a framework or a schedule with milestones, as you think about your discussions with MOFCOM and the Chinese; how should we thinking about the sequence of events, the Chinese events and the impact of both, number one, your OpEx, and then number two, the opportunities with cost of goods sold. Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","Sure. I will comment on the process, as best I can. Just to remind everybody, in March, we have the opportunity, I will call it reapply or submit a request to MOFCOM for them to lift the whole separate restriction. In terms of how the process plays out from there, I am sorry to say, I don't know how that's going to play out. We don't have a lot of visibility to that, it's a new process. In other words, we are either the first, or one of the first companies to actually reapply for that to be lifted. So we are going to have to see how that goes. In the meantime, our working relationship, more from the standpoint of us complying with all the separate, continues with MOFCOM and continues to be constructive, and we will continue a dialog with them, as we get closer to March to aid us in having more transparency in terms of how the process will unfold, and we will inform the investment community, as we learn more -- as to how that's going to play out.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great.","Stephen Milligan","In terms of the impact on our financial results, what we have said is that, we believe that it will allow us to realize OpEx synergies of about $100 million a quarter. We have not quantified the impact from a gross margin perspective, but obviously, it will be beneficial to our gross margin profile as well.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. I will cede the floor.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. IBM reported, I think Intel also reported that the server business was somewhat softer, and there are some specifics there for both firms, for example, Intel, they had some problems with its motherboard shipments, with its new Xenon chip. And I am just wondering about the enterprise market. You have been flat there for the last couple of quarters on units. Were there some industry specific things that are impacting the market, and how does that look?","Stephen Milligan","We were not affected by any of that, and had no visibility to that. So as I indicated earlier, the performance enterprise business, which would be directly applicable to server related activity, pretty much came in along our expectations.","Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets","Okay. And just as a follow-up. Did you see any strengthening, or have you seen any strengthening as this quarter began or as the last quarter ended? Have we seen linear results or just normal seasonality?","Stephen Milligan","Are you talking about the March quarter?","Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets","The current quarter, I mean, is that showing any -- is it just showing normal seasonality?","Stephen Milligan","Well the March quarter, as we talked about earlier, Chinese New Year is early this year, earlier than normal. Also we got some, rather large OEM customers, with January year-ends or quarter ends; and so, linearity so far in the March quarter has been strong. The question is, is how sustainable is that, as we get past Chinese New Year, as well as, when we move into, what traditionally would be weaker times of the year, March and then obviously April, but that's the next year. But those typically, from a seasonal perspective, are getting into the weaker times of the year for us.","Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, I was just wondering, on the PC market, you talked about next quarter, the conservatism. How much of that is coming from the consumer market versus the commercial market? And then from an OpEx standpoint, let's just make the assumption that MOFCOM doesn't get released anytime soon. But what's the right sort of OpEx range that you guys can run it in? Is it the $600 million you are talking about next quarter or can you gradually burn some of that down a little bit, back into that 500, 595 range you talked about historically? Thanks.","Stephen Milligan","So on the PC front, just to add a little bit more color. We have seen, where the strength is coming, it has been in the commercial segment. So the cautiousness is clearly in the consumer market, and so that's that. Let me give a little bit of context to the OpEx situation, and then I will have Tim comment on the specific numbers.","We are in a bit of a transitioning kind of period, really for two different reasons. One is, is that we have got the pending application or submission to MOFCOM, and what may or may not be the outcome of that, which at this time, we don't know what the decision would be.","The second thing is, that we have got these recent acquisitions that we have done, and investments that we are making in enterprise SSD. One of the things that we want to make sure we know that we are disadvantaged from a financial perspective, versus our -- in this case, largest competitor, OpEx perspective; because we are required to carry, in some cases, 2X of whatever happens to be from an investment perspective, given the regulatory situation that we are in.","One of the things that we want to make sure that we are doing, which does drive a higher level of OpEx, is that we are investing appropriately in some of these new initiatives. And so, as we go through this transition period, finding that right level of OpEx is a bit more challenging, than otherwise it would. So that provides a bit more context, in terms of -- from the business perspective, what we are dealing with, in terms of our operating expenses. So Tim can comment on the specific numbers.","Timothy Leyden","So, our guide for the December quarter was -- for non-GAAP was $595 million. We actually came in on GAAP at around $616 million. The major difference there were driven by the stock appreciation rates, which covered more than 60% of the difference between those two numbers, and the balance was performance incentives. And in the near to mid term, I think the 600 run rate is probably a better number to go with for now. So a $600 million number is one that you should be plugging into the model.","Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit of detail on your cash flexibility. Tim, I think you said you have $700 million in cash in the US. I know you have a strategy of spending about 60% of your free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. But it looks like your US cash is getting a little tight. So I just wanted to get a sense of, how much longer you can sustain that? I know you just did a refinance of your debt, so may be some detail there would be helpful?","Timothy Leyden","Yeah Sherri. You're right, and the number is 700 million as we close the quarter. However, the renegotiation of the bank loan did improve our position. We did that renegotiation for a number of reasons, the first one being, obviously taking advantage of the market conditions. And we also got lower rates, we got longer time period extending from 2017 up to 2019. We upsized the facility also, and the biggest advantage relative to your question, is that we brought it from offshore to onshore. So consequently, the $700 million now has the capability to be able to be up around $3 billion or so.","So consequently, we have taken action in order to ensure that we don't get tight, relative to continuing to meet our obligations of what we have promised on the capital allocation front.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks Tim, that's helpful. And then I guess also, wanted an update on your CapEx plan. I know you guys are in the middle of upgrading your wafer facility, that took a couple of years. Is that finished, and what would you view as the investments you need to make in CapEx this year? Thanks.","Timothy Leyden","Yeah, we'd be able to stay within our 5% to 7% model. Actually, for the first couple of quarters, I think we have been running more like 4%, and we are -- from a CapEx viewpoint, I think we are underutilized in [heads]. We are underutilized also in substrates and sputtering going out as much underutilized in hedge. And of course in assembly and in tests, we continue to balance that and respond to the market. So I think, we are pretty comfortable within the model, the 5% to 7% model.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","And the wafer is done, is that right or no?","Timothy Leyden","Yes.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan","I just want to build off of Sherri's question on CapEx. Steve, what's kind of your view, if the market or the TAM improves by 5% to 7% this year, which is hypothetical, what would be your response? Would you kind of be measured and not really have that capacity during the first few quarters, or would you have to add at a pretty big pace? I guess, we are just kind of curious, in terms of what would be the kind of puts and takes that you have to really increase the CapEx?","Stephen Milligan","I think we are addressing at a little bit more general level. I think that we are in a pretty good shape from an overall capacity perspective. In other words, you saw the TAM increase to the number that you are talking about, we would not have to add a lot of capacity. We might have to add a bit of test assembly, but that tends to be lower cost. So I would expect that our capital budget or capital spending should be closer to the low end of that 5% to 7%, and certainly, where we are at year-to-date, we are actually below that. So I don't envision us making any meaningful capital additions this year, that would strike that number upwards.","Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan","Okay. Then the other question is a little more bigger picture. Just given the talent that WD has been hiring as well as acquiring, on the software side, how should investors think about your longer term kind of place in the ecosystem of the data center? Are you going to have more of an impact in terms of helping design architect systems versus building the devices that go in the systems, and how does that impact your interaction with both the end customer as well as the OEM customer?","Stephen Milligan","Well, that's a bit of a complicated question, in the sense that the storage ecosystem, as we have alluded to, is changing quite dramatically, in a number of different ways, and for really, all participations. So that is for us, and our primary competitors, it is for, I will call, our traditional customers, and its also for some of our newer, you may call it, non-traditional customers, so some of the hyperscale guys. Also, the used cases, in other words, what people are doing with data, is changing quite dramatically. That then gets into increased complexity, increased fragmentation, increased opportunity for us, and if you want to call it, increased customization. That's allowing us the opportunity, whether it happens to be by providing additional peers from a cost perspective, if it happens to be adding different value from a software perspective, it allows us the opportunity to add value to our customers, whether they be hyperscale or traditional customers, any different way.","As we do that, and if we do it -- if we execute appropriately, that certainly does provide us with the opportunity to look at margin expansion over time. We are certainly not committing to that, but we do think that that's an opportunity that we should be striving to realize, as we move forward.","Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Couple of questions for me, maybe if you could talk about your enterprise business, looks like total units are kind of flat on a sequential basis. Any dynamics you see within the business [critical] and capacity optimized side would be helpful.","Stephen Milligan","Nothing particular in terms of performance or capacity enterprise. Capacity enterprise can be a bit lumpy. In other words, it's a little bit project based. We did, and I am not concerned about this, everybody is aware. I think we did lose a bit of share in the quarter, that just tends to be the lumpiness about particular projects and which customers and that kind of thing, but the long term -- and the overall industry level from a demand perspective, things played out more or less as we expected it. Nothing to really speak of, and we continue to feel very positive about how we are positioned from an overall competitive standpoint.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And then, I guess if I look at the free cash flow generation, which you guys talked about as obviously being very strong for the last couple of quarters now, how do you think about the 50 commitment -- or kind of 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders? Given the deals that you guys have done, and now you have a good portfolio in the far side, do you start to evaluate that and potentially move that number higher, or do you need the MOFCOM decision to be behind you, to revalue that 50% threshold?","Stephen Milligan","Certainly, the MOFCOM decision would help and the synergies that we would pick up from that, would certainly be a help. But we do evaluate the percentage of free cash flow that they are allocating. When we made the decision in September of 2012, those are pretty big decisions for the company. It was something that we hadn't done before. So we are at the point where we are constantly evaluating it, and once we see that there is an opportunity to be able to respond to it, and particularly if we get some significant synergies from integration, then we would look more favorable at increasing it.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital, your line is open.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Two if I could, I guess the first one is back to gross margins, Steve and Tim. Steve, earlier, you commented that, I guess that you thought the meaningful driver is, our ability to add value, and then if you mix appropriately and sort of get at the integrated and a responsible way, does that often suggest that TAM stays, let's call it like a 130 to 145 range where it has kind of been the last six to eight quarters, that you would also have the expectation for margins to continue to appreciate over time?","Stephen Milligan","So, if you go back to what we have talked about, in terms of longer term unit growth, which we talked about in September of 2012, we have not updated our expectations at this point. But we talked about a longer term 3% unit growth. The real big swing factor there is what actually happens with PC sales. That does not assume growth in PC sales, it's more so the question is what exactly -- because that's such a big part of the number, right. So my comment, if the TAM dropped significantly, then obviously we'd have to look at something. But I don't think -- we are not assuming that there is going to be meaningful TAM expansion from an overall perspective. So the TAM was in the 135-ish range, just kind of use that as a round number. My comment that I made in terms of margin expansion stands.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Then just a follow-up for me guys, what are your TAM expectations for 2014 calendar?","Stephen Milligan","We haven't given a number, and at this point, I don't think we are going to be giving a number. We have to kind of wait and see. There is still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, uncertainty. But again, we will have to continue to monitor.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Okay great. Thanks.","Operator","Next is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Okay, thank you. Steve, I wanted to come back to your comment and the prepared remarks about customization in the cloud. I assume this relates back to the helium drive, but do you expect to see a fairly wide portfolio with specs that may be differ by customer or by industry vertical?","Stephen Milligan","Yes. I mean, in other words, the used cases that we are seeing for various different customers are different. So accordingly, the solutions or the product suite that they are looking for, varies. So there may be some customers that go to extremes, that have no interest in enterprise SSDs, for whatever reason. And then you may have other customers that have a high degree of interest in that, but no interest in the helium-filled drive.","So it depends upon how they are utilizing data in their organization that\u2019s impacting how we work with those particular customers.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","It's a really interesting dynamic. I assume more R&D spend would be involved and likely, higher ASP products and higher profit product also.","Stephen Milligan","Right.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Thank you.","Operator","Steven Fox with Cross Research, your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions for me. First off, it looks like your average capacity per drive accelerated for the first time in about three quarters. Can you sort of talk about how much of that trend is sustainable, going out over the next few quarters and what drove it in the most recent quarter? And then secondly, I think you mentioned the SSD sales of 155 million, I guess there were sort of -- I guess a one time in there. Just sort of how impactful is that, as we look towards the next quarter on a sequential basis?","Timothy Leyden","I will address the average gigabyte and Steve will address the SSD. So average gigabyte -- contributing to that was a couple of factors. The first one is the strength of branded products, and that has a significantly higher per drive capacity than the rest of the consumer business, and of course, we also had strong distribution channel in the quarter. So that drove most of that improvement.","Stephen Milligan","Then in terms of enterprise SSD, the sole source opportunity was meaningful enough that we felt compelled to comment on it obviously. And given that, and that it is a bit of a non-recurring situation that we may see, our revenue declined slightly going into this quarter. But obviously, it's still a bit early to call that for sure.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","And just to follow-up on that, I mean, depending on who you talk to, you could see enterprise SSD demand be as high as 30%, 40%? If not greater, depending on what you think about capital spending. I mean, is that the type of industry you're sort of benchmarking against, when you talk about outperforming the industry in coming quarters?","Stephen Milligan","Yes.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Joe Yoo with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets","Thank you. So your hard drive ASPs were meaningfully, on a sequential basis, despite gaming actually being strong. So wanted to ask, what drove the increase, and related to that, can you provide some color on the like-for-like pricing and cost declines for the quarter, and were they better or worse than expected?","Timothy Leyden","So pricing was driven again by the strength of the channel and the strength of the consumer in branded, and that goes then to drive higher average ASP, and from a cost viewpoint, the cost to time has slowed down, because the area of density improvement has slowed down. So what we are seeing is, somewhere in the region of between 1% and 2% of cost decline, and pricing is following cost decline. So we are seeing pricing decline moderation as well, as a result of that.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets","And as a follow-up of the enterprise SSD space business. You guided again for another $0.10 dilution from the acquisition in the March quarter. So should we be modeling a $0.10 dilution for much of this year, this calendar year, or should we be looking at some kind of release from that dilution, as we get into the second half?","Timothy Leyden","That dilution will remain pretty much right through the end of the year; because we began to see the accretion in the early part of 2013. So consequently, we should keep that dilution in the model, through the calendar year.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets","Great. Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Next is from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. Your line is open.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. With the stability in My Cloud, can you provide any metrics around the traction you are getting with this, and also, is it reasonable to believe that this is an incremental TAM above the current blended market and the increased functionality, [and in terms of] ASPs companies like DropBox are charging beyond initial free capacity? Anything you can do to help us size the opportunity, incremental (inaudible) would be definitely helpful?","Stephen Milligan","Yeah, it's an interesting question. I am not sure, that at this point we have an updated analysis incremental to the traditional business versus, just substituting other units. And so, I think we will have to continue to monitor that. Relative to specific data, we traditionally have not broken out specific sales of a given product, and so, we are very encouraged by the response from the marketplace so far. We have, I will call it, high expectations for continued success in 2014.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","And if I may, if I could ask about desktops. Not quite sure I understand why desktops were down, and Dell recorded an 11% increase year-over-year in desktops from their perspective?","Stephen Milligan","We had a bit of share loss, and that's reflective of the industry. Desktop, as an overall statement, is a pretty stable market.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi thanks. I think the enterprise has been beat to death pretty well, but I might ask the question again. You saw the flattening in the back half of the year, I am just curious, what's a reasonable expectation for unit growth going forward as you look into calendar 2014. From reading between what you said, it sounds like we got a little bit of a pause in some of the capacity you've build out. So looking out over the next four quarters, theoretically, some of those ebbs and flows kind of get smoothed out, we are still looking at a high single digit\/10% kind of unit number that I think you last spoke about, at your most recent Analyst Day?","Timothy Leyden","Yeah. What we are looking for is somewhere in the region of high single digits on an annual basis, particularly in capacity. In performance, that's going to be pretty much flat, I would say.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research","Okay, great. And then on the cash return to shareholders, it seems like right now you are actually trending closer to 40% of the current run rate. You understand, maybe the cash flow weakens with the seasonality coming up here in the first half of the calendar year. But is that kind of the rate right now to expect, perhaps as you are still incurring $25 million a quarter for the Seagate court ruling, or could there be a step-up there, even -- absent a court ruling and absent a MOFCOM ruling, let's say?","Timothy Leyden","I was trying to be pretty precise about it, but our objective is to meet our obligations, which is to pay out 50% of the free cash flow. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things that happened in the December quarter, which mitigated against that. One of them was, we had to pay for the Virident acquisition; and also, we had the secondary offering with Hitachi, and both of those didn't allow us to be able to be exiting the market during the period that those things were open. So consequentially, that mitigated against our opportunity to get to the 50%.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research","Okay. Then finally, very quick follow-up Tim; the $0.10 dilution that's there from the SSD acquisition, is that totally on the OpEx line, and if that's the case, is it about $20 million, $25 million per quarter in that range?","Timothy Leyden","Yeah, it's mostly in the OpEx line.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research","Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question is from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners","Thanks very much. Hopefully I can get two questions in, just to keep the pattern going. One just on hybrid drives, I know we talked about them all of a sudden. Just wondering, what your progress is like there in the December quarter, maybe versus your expectations? And then separate from that, and gaming, given that you -- given the strong start for the new game console cycles, obviously it has helped the past couple of quarters. If you look at seasonality in that, if not cyclicality and through the year, how do you plan for that, given you don't have necessarily the same sort of seasonality you might have in most businesses, just more of a cyclicality to it, and particularly maybe Steve, you have history there from your Hitachi days, how do you plan for that, given that it's sort of driven by two customers? Thanks.","Stephen Milligan","Yeah. So on the hybrid, the volumes for 2013 were modest, which was more or less consistent with what our expectations and what we have said historically and it remains the case, is that, hybrid is more of a 2014 story for us. We will have to continue and see, at what level we make momentum from a customer perspective, acceptance of that kind of a solution. But things are tracking to our expectations. We did not expect the volumes to be that large in 2013.","Relative to gaming, it's an interesting question. There is not really seasonality there. I mean, there is a bit of it, in terms of when they build. But they tend to build earlier in the year, put them on [boats], get them stocked up and save on the shipping costs and that sort of thing. So I would say that we're very encouraged by the reception to the new gaming consoles, and I think that that, and also the fact that it's a one-to-one attach rate with hard drives. We do not obviously have all of that business, but we participate in a very healthy rate with the two customers that you commented on and we do view that as a bit of a tailwind for the drive industry going into 2014.","Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners","Great. Thanks very much.","Stephen Milligan","So, thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward. So thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth, the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the September quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results, expectations for the September quarter.

So we will not be taking any questions about sTec's business or its financial performance today. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note the copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital.","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our June quarter results and outlook for the September quarter. I am pleased with our performance in the June quarter. Our financial results were strong, including significant free cash flow generation, reflecting outstanding execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries. Industry demand in the June quarter was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the September quarter to be up modestly. Our production levels will be adjusted to prevailing demand conditions. Our growing participation in the storage market continues to highlight our broad-based role in the important and secular trend of digital data growth. We anticipate that the demand for exabytes of storage will grow by at least 34% per year through 2020, with exabytes shipped rising from 600 in 2012 to 5,900 in 2020. With advancements in storage, processing power, software and big data analytics, storage requirements are increasing significantly.","There are thousands of new applications that are emerging based on new capabilities. An excellent example is the capability of one website that is processing 200 billion flight reservations to advise it's users when to optimally buy airline tickets. It is clear from applications like these that storage and the utilization of vast amounts of data are enabling breakthrough innovations, providing tangible support to underpin these data growth forecasts. Our goal is to innovate and differentiate our solutions to help our customers create value in this dynamic environment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the breadth of storage solutions we are providing.","The Western Digital platform is unique, powerful and market-driven, underpinned by increasingly collaborative customer relationships, leveraging our rich engineering heritage and resources. For our fiscal year ended June, approximately 50% of our revenue was derived from applications in markets that are powering the public and personal cloud. While we are encouraged by recent innovations in the PC space, with less than half of our revenue as we exited fiscal 2013, the storage industry is experiencing dramatic change and we are participating in the high-growth markets of the future, investing in innovation and strategic acquisitions.","In the last year, we have led the industry with the introduction of several new advanced solutions including our 7-disk helium sealed drives for cloud storage, our low-profile 5- and 7-millimeter solid-state hybrid drives and hard drives for ultra portable devices and new hard drive and mass solutions for small and medium businesses. All of these products have been well received by our customers.","At our Investor Day last September, we indicated that we had established a strong position in enterprise solid-state storage with our family of SaaS-based SSD solutions. We also indicated that we were evaluating an expansion into other areas of this market. We concluded that solid-state storage will play an increasingly strategic role through continued innovation and differentiation. As a result, we recently made several important investments to strengthen and expand our enterprise SSD capabilities, including our proposed acquisition of sTec, an early pioneer in enterprise-class SSDs, the acquisition of VeloBit, a provider of high-performance storage I\/O optimization software, and our investment in Skyera, a provider of very high-performance storage arrays. The sTec and VeloBit acquisitions will augment our existing technology position and IP portfolio in one of the industry's fastest growing markets.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance and position in today's changing storage industry, and we are continuing to take steps that will enhance our ability to become one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our June quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model, our sustained strong execution and the continued change of our business mix. The HDD industry shipped approximately 133 million units during the June quarter, slightly down from the March quarter and in line with our expectations in late April. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise. Stable quarter-over-quarter performance inclined in consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded products.","On a year-over-year basis, our business mix reflects our strong participation in growing cloud-related markets, with capacity enterprise and branded products up significantly. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $15.4 billion. Broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, our non-PC-related business has grown from 35% to 50% of our revenue. Among PC-related businesses, includes our enterprise, branded and consumer electronic businesses. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion. We shipped a total of 59.9 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business mix and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.1%, excluding $35 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 60 basis points better than our guidance, reflecting better-than-expected business mix and capacity utilization and lower-than-anticipated price declines.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $582 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $18 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred charges of $8 million in the June quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. Tax expense for the June quarter was $35 million or 7.8% of pretax income. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $416 million or $1.71 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $477 million or $1.96 per share. For fiscal year 2013, our net income totaled $1.7 billion or $6.75 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $2.1 billion or $8.53 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $684 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $548 million. For fiscal year 2013, we generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. CapEx for the June quarter totaled $136 million. For the full fiscal year, we invested $952 million or 6.2% of revenue, including approximately $191 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would have been at 5% of revenue, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in the current demand environment.","As part of our capital allocation strategy, first outlined last September at our Investor Day, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $235 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2013, in total, we repurchased 19 million shares for $842 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the June quarter. In total, we declared a dividend of $1 per share or a total of $240 million during fiscal year 2013. We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S.","As disclosed in our press release, our financial information for the June quarter does not include any additional accruals as a result of the decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. We're in the process of reviewing the decision to determine whether or not to record an accrual for the June quarter.","I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter, which does not include the estimated impact of the proposed sTec acquisition. For the September quarter, we are cautiously optimistic about a modest increase in the TAM, and we anticipate sustained strong performance within our business model. We expect a total available market of 135 million to 140 million units, up from the June quarter, primarily due to a seasonal uptick in gaming and branded products. Revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin well within our business model, and approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. Tax rate within our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately 242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance and we're excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving -- of the storage market. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the quarter, when you look at your operating expense line, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected in the June quarter. Can you talk about where we stand, as far as operating expenses, let's say, beyond the current quarter? And how we should maybe think about the progression of that operating expense relative to your long-term target model of 10% to 12%? And I do have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, Aaron. If you look to our investors summary, total operating expenses worth $590 million. That included $8 million of other charges. There were $10 million or $11 million of amortization of intangibles in there, and there was another $7 million of restructuring charges. If you deduct all of that, you're at $565 million, which compares to our guidance of $550 million, and the entire difference was due to incentive accruals that we took based on the performance of the teams. So we pretty much came out exactly like we anticipated and the real operational difference are intended for growth. As it relates to the go-forward spending, we've been very successful to keep it around that $550 million, and we'll be prudent going forward. We have said in the FAQ document that we issued alongside with the announcement of the sTec acquisition that, that will increase the OpEx for the time being. So we continue to be prudent and -- but we'll not forgo investment opportunities. And then of course, we will have to work longer-term on amortization, which will then give us a catalyst of to get into our 10% to 12% business model.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-up, thinking about the business model and, obviously, thinking about you capital allocation strategy, you've seen a fairly consistent trend on the cash flow generation over the past several quarters, given what you've laid out for the September quarter, is there any change in the trajectory or that trend as we look out over the next couple of quarters in terms of free cash flow generation?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, $2.2 billion and each quarter above $525 million. That is a sign of a pretty stable, well-managed business. We intend to keep it that way. We stand to our capital allocation strategy, 50% of free cash flow, like we announced last year in September at the Investor Day, and we have no change as to that, today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. First, on the SSD front, I know you don't want get too much into comments on sTec, but the -- is there any sense you have that you could give us now on whether or not, post-deal, that there'd be enough revenue where you could actually break SSDs out as a category? Right now, it's basically a plug, but is there any way you could comment on that? Then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Rich, that's an interesting question. This is Steve. I mean, obviously, we'd like to think that the revenue gets big enough that we can break it out. I think we'll have to wait and see how it works out. We've been encouraged, in that we are limited, because we're still going through the regulatory review process and we're 2 separate companies, but we've been encouraged by the customer reaction that we've gotten regarding our proposed acquisition and we're comfortable that we think we're going -- that, that's going to be a sound investment for us and we're looking forward to working through the regulatory approval process in closing that transaction. So I hope that I can tell you after we get through a bit that we're big enough to be able to disclose and separate that out.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of that appeals court commentary, is -- should this actually go against you, would you be able to use your full cash balance, including the offshore, or would you need to use the domestic dollars?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","We would use offshore cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just 2 questions on 2 different end markets. Just -- from looking at your branded sales and looking at Seagate's, I know you mentioned seasonality in that market, but I was curious if there's any kind of weakness in demand relative to the market, or maybe you're gaining some market share there. It seems like both companies, it's my observation, were relatively weak in that market. And if not, maybe you could just talk about how you think it's going to proceed for the rest for the calendar year? And then, secondly, on the flip side, could you talk about maybe the enterprise market? It's obviously been very strong because of some web scale spending. Do you think there's a pause coming in that or how do you sort of gain the demand trends there?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I'll start you off, Steven, and then Steve will probably comment on top of that. Branded, really no surprise, it's seasonally a soft quarter, particularly Europe is always very soft at this time of the year. Very pleased with the mix. You're seeing sell-in data that we're reporting. We're very pleased with the inventory levels in the market there. I'm very confident that, that market is seasonally picking up in the next 2 quarters. So really nothing that we wouldn't have expected there. Ongoing move there to NAS Boxes away from direct attached, but really nothing extraordinary to report on. The enterprise market last quarter was a little bit stronger than we expected and particularly on the capacity enterprise space. And that's really playing out as we predicted it as well. Performance enterprise is stable, but not up. Capacity enterprise, up. And like we said before, that segment of the market that we think for the next 5, 6, 7 years, has the strongest growth. And we said before that we wouldn't be surprised if that would be double digit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Choksi with Technology Insight Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","So client performance was -- client hard drive performance was flat Q-to-Q, which is consistent with the third-party market research organizations. But in the March Q, the hard drive and Western Digital client performance outperformed. I was wondering if you could talk about that in the context of hybrid and dual drive uptake by OEMs. And to follow-on with that, can you talk about what your expectations are with whether or not hybrid drives will be GM accretive, and if it's not GM accretive, will be at least gross profit accretive per unit?","Stephen D. Milligan","So in terms of our business, we, for the first half of the year, have not been impacted by -- we're not shipping a hybrid drive in terms of the first half of the year. It's really for us, more of a back half of calendar 2013, and in particular, 2014, as we see customers begin to adapt that sort of a solution. And now, customers are, as you referenced, dual-drive configurations are meaningful. And we're kind of agnostic, frankly, whether it's a dual-drive configuration or a hybrid configuration. And so, because both of them, ultimately, use a hard drive or spinning disks. Now in terms of the gross margin comment, I'm going to deflect that question in the sense that we don't typically talk about gross margin by product, whether or not it's accretive or non-accretive. And so I'm going to not answer that question.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Okay. Do you mind if I ask a separate question then?","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","The cash conversion cycle, that was up an unseasonal 5 days quarter-over-quarter. And looks like it was primarily driven by an increase of DSOs. But you guys clearly said that channel inventory's not an issue. So can you give some clarification as far as what's really going in -- on here? And does this impact your visibility into September quarter relative to past September quarters?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Nehal, there's no change in payment behavior of our customers. We had really good linearity in the quarter, as you can see from our free cash flow. The uptick in DSO is purely a function of channel mix. If you look at the channel split, our OEM business went from 60% to 66%, and our Distribution business and Branded business went down. So no significant change. Seasonally, expect that -- and doesn't have any impact on visibility on the September quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I guess, two, if I could. The first is just a general question around gross margin dynamics. Could you give us an update on, I guess, where you are with the single platter shift and what the impact -- at least [indiscernible to margins was this quarter? And then, can you first speak to why margins wouldn't go up in the second half of the year? Or is there a chance for that and you're just sort of being prudent with the guidance, given sort of more stable than expected like-for-like ASPs and what's going on with mix? And I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","So as it relates to Q4, gross margin, we're very pleased to beat the guidance by 60 basis points. And that was really a function of several things, capacity utilization, but also of business mix, more enterprise business, and then lower like-for-like price declines. As we go into the September quarter, the flat margin is more or less a function of the business mix. We have plans for modest price declines and, as every quarter, we're trying to optimize the results as we go through the quarter.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And just some clarification on the transition to single platter, and then I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","We're making steady progress. Last quarter, I told you that we're around 50%, and that we would probably take another year or so to completely transition it. We'll do that when it economically makes sense, and we're making steady progress on that front.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And I guess, the last thing for me is can you speak about, or is it too early to speak about it, could you give us some sense of what your expectations are for the game cycle? Refreshes are taking place in the second half of the year and, traditionally, that's been, I guess, a really strong market for you guys. So I guess, any detail you can give us around how we should be thinking about that in the context of industry potential and WD potential would be helpful.","Stephen D. Milligan","I'm sorry, what cycle? I didn't understand what you said.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","The -- sort of, I guess, the new Xbox and the new PlayStation.","Stephen D. Milligan","Oh, yes, yes, yes. So those are 100% attach rates and part of the demand increase that we're -- or TAM increase, I guess, I should say, that we're expecting in calendar Q3 is reflective of that, the gaming build that will take place for the Christmas season. And so we're happy that it's going to be a 100% attach rate. And we will, as a company, we've been a relatively big participant on the gaming business. I mean, there's only 2 guys, right, Microsoft and Sony. And we will continue to participate in that business to the extent that it makes economic sense.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Thanks, Steven. I guess, that suggests sort of de facto share gain in the second half of the year, since you guys are the dominant player there?","Stephen D. Milligan","I wouldn't imply that. I mean, we've been a strong participant in that market, if we're going back for a while. And so I wouldn't imply that we think that there'll be share gains solely as a consequence of that, right? We have to see how everything plays out.","Operator","Our next question comes Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The first one for me is, could you provide some comments on what you think the TAM does in December?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. We assume, right now, in our modeling that's around 140 million units.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So...","Stephen D. Milligan","One of the things that we're going to have to do, Keith, and this is -- it's going to be interesting to see. I mean, obviously, the news on the PC front has not been that rosy, right, in terms of what some of the other guys in the supply chain have talked about. And so now, what we're beginning to see is some building of product, sort of filling the pipe for back-to-school and for the holiday season, particularly, back-to-school, really, at this point. I mean, we're beginning to see increased sort of demand levels as a consequence of that. The key thing that we're going to have to see is, how does that product sell-through, right? Does that actually translate to either a flattening in terms of the declines that we've seen on the PC side or maybe a little bit of growth? And so what we're doing is taking a pretty cautious approach to that. And so -- but I certainly, it's kind of -- it's sort of a different question than what Rich asked about splitting out SSD, I'd certainly like to be able to report increasing or accelerating PC sales, but I don't think that we're at the point where we can say that yet. You have the sell-through happens.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, my second question actually relates to that, Steve. Over the last 4 quarters, and in particularly the last 2 quarters, your client units have done significantly better than your competition. And what's driving that? And would you give any comments on does that continue? And obviously against Seagate in particular?","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't know if I can comment on that both because, I mean, we have not had a specific strategy to increase our share in those markets, which is kind of interesting. And so, sometimes we look at the share numbers after the fact and -- because it's not a goal of ours to say, \"Hey, let's go and increase our market presence in that particular market.\" And so, I have a neat answer for you, other than, and it may sound a little bit self-serving, we are -- both WD and HGST have done a great job from an execution standpoint. And that's allowed us to increase our position in those marketplaces.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Any thoughts on whether that continues, Steve?","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't want to call that. Obviously, we want to make sure that our good execution continues. And if it happens to result in profitable gains from a market share perspective and the right kind of financial performance, we're happy to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","First up, I wanted to see if you could reconcile your projected growth in the TAM in the third quarter with your sales guidance. So the TAM, at the midpoint, you're up 3% or 4% sequentially. Your sales guidance at the midpoint is up 50, 60 bps, or something like that. So are you -- is that conservatism? Or are you perhaps going along with the last question, perhaps planning to concede a little bit of share after gaining quite a bit of it over the last few quarters?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Like Steve said, I mean, we're not really going into a quarter with particular share targets. We're trying to execute well and then put linearity in good products. But that's mostly a mix factor. In particular, the gaming business is a lower ASP business and that just plays into that equation.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","And then, you already said looking at -- talking about free cash flow for '14, you said you'd like to continue the stability, I guess. Any thoughts within that on capital expenditures? Do you still expect to be within the bottom of the range next year as you were this year?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, we will be in our business model from 5% to 7%, and we will heavily be focused on technology deployment and upgrades to new aerial densities and supply flexibility, et cetera. Then we just need to decide as we get into the second half of the fiscal year what the predictions are for the end of calendar '14, and that will determine where we end at the end of the day. But you should assume that we'll be extremely prudent and as just in time as possible with deployment of capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.","Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's Dan Garofalo on for Andy. I just wanted to talk about, from a restructuring standpoint, you've continued to kind of rightsize manufacturing, and if we set aside anything related to a favorable MOFCOM ruling, where would you say you're at with the rightsizing process? Are we -- are you kind of halfway done doing what you can do? Or is there more than less than that? Or how would you characterize that, I guess?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, I'll answer it this way. I mean, if you look at our financial performance, I mean, obviously, we want to do everything that we can to continue to improve our profitability. I think if you look at our gross margin performance, we're solidly within our gross margin range, which kind of implies that the actions that we've taken sort of seem to be appropriate from a rightsizing perspective. And that's, obviously, based upon, let's just use round numbers, say a TAM of kind of that 135-ish kind of range, 135 million a quarter. The thing that we have to watch closely and we're certainly not predicting it, but this is, do we have something further? If that were to change, and decrease, then we'd have to look at doing something else. But I think that we're comfortable where we're at, generally speaking, from a capacity perspective, given that kind of a TAM level.","Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then, just one follow-up for me. On the enterprise side, I think you've indicated that the 7-platter helium drive should be out sometime in the second half of the year. And I know you've touched on those in your prepared remarks, could you provide an update on timing there? And secondly, when the drives are available, is it fair to say, you expect some movement from market share perspective within the capacity optimized segment?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So we -- we're currently sampling these products with selected customers right now, or that product with selected customers. And we continue to expect that we will have units shipped and revenue realized before the end of the calendar year. The first generation product will not be a particularly significant volume product to start out with, as customers test it out and that sort of thing. So I would doubt whether or not that will meaningfully move the needle in terms of any market share in the capacity enterprise, at least initially. And then we'll have to see how the adoption goes from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just have a quick clarification. Can you give us some -- or can you give us the numbers for your nearline SATA enterprise versus the performance enterprise?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Sherri, we haven't broken that out.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you give us some ballpark or help us think about it in terms of magnitude?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","What we have said before is that our share in all the areas of the market that we serve is comparable. And the performance enterprise market is pretty stable, just shy of 8 million units compared to the last quarter.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just thinking about the recent acquisitions you've done with VeloBit or at least that you've announced in Skyera, just trying to understand the motivation for doing those acquisitions? I understand those to be primarily sort of SSD array type of companies, and you guys are an HD business, it doesn't seem like you'd be doing arrays yourselves, that would seem to be competing with your customers. But just wanted to understand where you're going with that technology?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So Sherri, just to clarify one thing. We did not acquire Skyera, we made an equity investment on Skyera back. And that -- and that's more of reflective of our interest to stay close to the technology changes and advancements that are going on in that space, as opposed to us getting into, per se, the storage or the SSD array kind of business. So that's one clarification. The VeloBit acquisition which, from a financial perspective, was not particularly significant, is really to provide software capability in terms of input\/output optimization, caching kind of capability, that sort of thing, to improve our existing -- or any future offerings that we have in the enterprise SSD space. So it really is an effort to make our products more compelling than they otherwise would be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions. One, I guess, if I look at the finished goods inventory, it was up about $22 million, 5% sequentially in the quarter. Could you maybe talk about what were the drivers that led to that uptick?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I'll take that question. Overall, our inventory was pretty stable for the last 3 quarters, and there's always a bit of a shift between the raw and FGI. But we have made a conscious decision to invest in FGI in 2 areas. Number one, we're making more use of boat shipments in areas where we understand the demand very well, and that contributes to our cost savings. And the second one is, we want to make sure that our just-in-time warehouses have sufficient inventory at quarter-end to make sure that there is a smooth operation guaranteed at our customers' level. Overall, we believe that we all the time have opportunity in the inventory space, but probably more in the raw and whip [ph] area that in the FGI area. So we're pretty pleased with the executions, very stable, but future opportunity is likely.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And I guess, if I just look at the September guide, you guys are suggesting gross margin should remain flat on a sequential basis. To me, at least it looks like the mix is going to end up being a bit of headwind with gaming's up, picking up on a sequential basis. Maybe just talk about what are the offsets to that mix being a bit of a drag in the September quarter?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, you're right that the mix is a bit of a headwind but then it's likely a little bit of a higher volume. That's a tailwind and then we'll continue to work on our costs and all the other elements. But you got it, the mix is the headwind and we're offsetting it with cost and good execution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just going back to the compute market, notebooks, specifically, were up more than seasonal. Can you talk about what area of that market you think you're taking share?","Stephen D. Milligan","Kate, I don't know if there's any specific area, per se. I think I commented on earlier in terms of -- it wasn't so much that we had a deliberate strategy to increase our market share in that particular segment, but both of our subs, just really, frankly, did a very nice job working with our customers in such a way that we were actually able to kind of keep our situations sort of flat when the market was down a little bit, and we were able to gain a little bit of share.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I understand visibility is probably pretty low, as you said, you're seeing build for back-to-school, but you got to see demand, are you seeing any signs in your business of a demand recovery in traditional PCs, or the traditional enterprise storage market?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, okay. That's kind of a two-pronged question. The traditional PCs, I mean, we -- our customers continue to be very cautious with regards to what they're seeing from a PC demand perspective, whether that be desktop or notebooks. And particularly, notebooks, right, is where the real cautiousness is. Desktop has tended to be a little bit more stable over time. When you start moving into the enterprise space, I mean, it depends upon who you're talking to and, obviously, we don't care to talk about specific customers, but with what we're seeing from a digital data growth perspective, demand in that space, overall, continues to increase. And that's reflective in the unit increases that we're seeing in terms of our enterprise business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm not sure how much it's related to the last question in -- earlier on, nearline, but Steve, maybe when you combine your SSD moves, about the strength you've had in the SaaS side and then in your planned acquisitions, and you look at the traditional enterprise market, I mean, do you look out and feel like traditional enterprise is a growth market or a shrinking market getting squeezed between nearline, at the low end, and SSD, at the high end? Or do you feel like that's actually a positive growth market going forward?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So traditionally, you hit the nail on the head, the traditional enterprise business, we do not view as a growth business. It's fairly stable in terms of its demand, which is great, which is fine. But the growth areas in terms of enterprise are in the capacity enterprise market, and then also we believe in enterprise class solid-state drives.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. And if I could ask a follow-up related to that, would you -- my guess is, no, but would you guys be willing to share what percentage of your enterprise revenue, even ballpark, is direct to kind of big web scale customers rather than through traditional OEM channel?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. I appreciate the question but that's not one that we're going to address, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","A few questions back. And I know you want to be cautious. But Nidec yesterday reported a 16% increase in their unit shipments of motors to hard drive manufacturers, and yet both you and Seagate, in terms of your TAM expectations, are certainly below that. Is this an inventory restocking thing or more cautious, or both?","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't know, Mark, honestly. I haven't gone and studied what Nidec disclosed. But it's -- it's obviously not -- it's got to be inventory-related. I mean, because it must be a replenishment thing, but that's speculation on my part.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Okay. You certainly made some big efforts recently in the solid-state drive market with your acquisition. But I was just wondering, 2 weeks ago, Micron kind of surprised people. A lot of people feel that they -- because of technology challenges that solid-state drive, NAND flash, can't be pushed much further beyond the 18-nanometer node. And a lot of firms are now looking at three-dimensional type flash. SANDisk, for instance, is talking about that in 2015. Yet Micron came out and said they, by perfecting a high-K metal gate process, were able now to -- are selectively sampling 16-nanometer flash and estimates are that they would have a factor 2 margin advantage if they can pull that off over competitors at a higher node, which if you look at it conversely, it could actually lower the price of, say, a 128-gig drive and keep margins same as some of your competitors' by $15 to $20. I'm just wondering any comments on that in terms of the impact on your solid-state or your hard drive business.","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't have any direct perspective on that, Mark. But I think that one of the things that we've got to keep in mind is that, I mean, flash or NAND is shipped into a lot of different applications. And those applications have different reliability or different characteristics. So I don't know if Micron is alluding to those being able ship into kind of client applications, which maybe have a different profile associated with them, it's one of the things that we've recognized and is part of the value add that we provide, as a hard drive company, is making sure that products that are provided meet the right criteria for enterprise kind of applications. So Micron, along with some of the other NAND guys that is accompanying that, we are working with and want to continue to work with, in terms of what it is to utilize their technology to the advancement of our customers.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","So your relationship with Micron would not put you at a disadvantage if they start competing against other people shipping flash coming out of a higher node? Is that correct?","Stephen D. Milligan","I think that the opportunity in the marketplace is big and I don't -- I think that there's plenty of opportunity for all of us.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","It was MLC flash which, I think, probably feels more for a lower end type storage application because of some of the issues with program arrays with MLC flash.","Stephen D. Milligan","I want to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and suppliers for their support.

And welcome to the Western Digital Corp Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Andrew you may begin.","Peter Andrew","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including business plans and strategies, industry trends, and business and financial outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current assumptions and expectations and we assume no obligation to update them to reflect new information or events.","Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and Guidance Summary that are being posted in the Investor Relations sections of our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.","Steve Milligan","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported revenue of $4.2 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $738 million and we delivered $1.45 in non-GAAP earnings per share with $469 million in operating cash flow during the quarter.","Despite a softening business environment, our fiscal second quarter results were generally within our guidance ranges. Consistent with indications we provided at our Investor Day, overall demand trends exhibited a negative bias as the quarter progressed, subsequent commentaries from several companies in our served markets and highlighted continued demand weakness. Geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions have contributed to our customers having a more cautious outlook.","Additionally Flash industry dynamics remain challenging. Consequently, our outlook for the March quarter will be significantly weaker than it would otherwise be given normal seasonality. I will comment on the actions that we are taking in response to current business conditions.","First, we have been transparent in sharing our views on the evolving business environment and we'll continue to do so. In December 2017, we were the first to describe normalization trends in Flash and since then we've enhanced our disclosures to provide greater insight into how we are performing in both Flash and hard drives.","Second, from a product perspective, we are entering calendar 2019 with the strongest product portfolio in our history. We expect to further enhance our portfolio throughout the year. In Flash, we continue to lead the industry's transition to 96 layer BiCS4 technology. We expect broad implementation of this technology across our product portfolio in calendar 2019. We have 96 layer products in customer hands today.","In the December quarter of calendar 2019, we expect BiCS4 to achieve BiCS mix crossover with the BiCS3 from a supply standpoint. The product development investments we have made are yielding results. Specifically, we have completed development of internal controller and firmware architectures that can be leveraged across our portfolio in client, enterprise, mobile and embedded applications. We now address all the key categories for the enterprise SSD market.","In addition, we will be sampling our enterprise NVMe product with BiCS4 by mid-2019. We have a significant market position with our NVMe client portfolio and expect to further capitalize on this success. We will be shipping our mainstream client SSD based on BiCS4 in the March quarter.","Our embedded solutions are now shipping to all of the top global smartphone manufacturers enabled by our expanding portfolio of UFS products. Surveillance, automotive and gaming are attractive growth opportunities for Flash and we are already making inroads in these areas.","In hard drives we continue to provide the enterprise market with leading aerial densities, enabling the highest capacity points and most cost-effective solutions. We have had an exceptionally smooth qualification process for our 14-terabyte helium drive and expect customer qualification activities for this industry-leading offering to be completed at virtually all of our customers in the current quarter. We've already commenced revenue shipments for several customers.","Last quarter we announced a 15 terabyte offering at our Investor Day and described our plans for a 16-terabyte product based on energy assist technology. This will be followed by an 18-terabyte product, details of which will be shared later this calendar year. Data Center Systems continue to gain momentum across all of its product offerings in the quarter.","As we've previously indicated, we are taking actions to right-size our factory production levels while ensuring we maintain our competitiveness and technology leadership. In Flash we are executing on the previously announced changes.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Once again ladies and gentlemen please standby.","Peter Andrew","Hi Sherry.","Operator","Hi yes, we can hear you now. ","Peter Andrew","Put me back on the line I'm going to begin the call. ","Operator","You're in the line, sir. We can hear you now.","Peter Andrew","You can hear?","Operator","Yes, I can hear you.","Peter Andrew","Okay. We're okay on your side now?","Operator","Yes, I believe so.","Peter Andrew","Okay.","Steve Milligan","All right. Well, I don't know where we cut off. Anyway I'm going to back up - sorry about that, I'm going to back a little bit on my script.","As we have previously indicated, we are taking actions to right-size our factory production levels while ensuring we are maintaining our competitiveness and technology leadership. In Flash, we are executing on the previously announced changes to our wafer output levels to reduce our bit supply growth for calendar 2019.","We are also making adjustments to the pace of our capital investments in Flash in order to align of our bit output with our market demand. Additionally, we have accelerated the closure of our Kuala Lumpur hard drive manufacturing facility by almost three quarters.","Lastly, we are implementing substantial cost and expense reductions across the company. In total, we are targeting $800 million in annualized reductions in non-GAAP cost and expenses. Mike and Mark will provide further details in their prepared remarks.","The long-term growth opportunities for our business remain unchanged. Transformative trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, mobility, and IoT will continue to drive massive amounts of data that needs to be captured, preserved, accessed, and transformed.","Western Digital remains well-positioned to further capitalize on the fundamental opportunities associated with the rapid growth in the volume and value of data. I want to thank the Western Digital team and all our partners for their ongoing support.","With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Mike Cordano","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone.","We have spent the last two years aggressively investing and building our architectural platforms to power product line expansion. We are now at the point where these platforms and the products launched from these platforms are ramping as we enter 2019. The results of these investments gives us the confidence that we have the strongest portfolio in the company's history.","Before I get into the details of our December quarter performance, I'd like to comment on how we intend to capitalize on the strength of our expanding portfolio throughout the calendar year and beyond.","Our architectural platforms consisted of a combination of industry-leading-based technologies, internally developed controllers, and the corresponding firmware. The underlying storage technology whether Flash or the hard drive heads and media and the manufacturing and test processes to mass-producer products with high yields and industry-leading quality.","We have developed our product portfolio to allow us to increase our participation and differentiated end markets that have strong growth prospects. We are also strengthening our market-facing capabilities across the sales, marketing, and go-to-market organizations.","These key ingredients are allowing us to innovate and quickly bring products to our targeted end markets working collaboratively with our customers in the broader ecosystem. We are now in a position to drive greater participation in higher value markets and expect to corresponding improvement in the quality of our revenue throughout 2019. I will illustrate with a few important achievements today.","For the data center we began qualifications of our NVMe SSD product in the December quarter and due to stronger customer pull we expect to ramp this product for the meaningful revenue by the middle of this calendar year. Leveraging our enterprise architectural platform and the associated IP blocks, we will be able to expand our enterprise SSD product portfolio throughout 2019 in a cost-effective and predictable manner. This includes shipping BiCS4 based products to customers within this calendar year.","In capacity enterprise, we are focused our investments to build upon a highly successful helium technology platform, which has become an industry standard. We continue to maintain our leadership position as demonstrated by the ongoing ramp of our 14-terabyte hard drive and the introduction of our 16-terabyte hard drive later in the calendar year.","Our position in the midrange capacity enterprise market continues to strengthen with the ramp of our cost optimized 4 terabyte to 8 terabyte products, fueling customer breadth and geographic penetration.","We continue to capitalize on our industry-leading client SSD platform with products spanning from high performance gaining solutions to cost optimized mainstream offerings. All with the quality and reliability customers expect from Western Digital. This platform will enable exciting derivative products which will announce throughout this year.","In mobile and embedded, we will further expand our presence within top-tier accounts given our complete portfolio of products to address all categories of this market. We've got it additional design wins with our eMMC and UFS solutions further expanding our customer base and enhancing our position among the top five smartphone manufacturers.","We're also successfully developing leading embedded solutions for automotive, connected home, and surveillance categories. This is being illustrated through several of the product announcements, we've made in the second half of 2018 and expect to make in the coming quarters. We are realizing the benefits of two years of accelerated product R&D investments already in terms of greater participation and higher value areas of the market and a broadening customer base.","I will now provide additional details on some of the near term actions we are taking. We previously announced the reduction to wafer starts for a proportion of the Flash joint venture along with the way deployment of the capital equipment. The magnitude of these actions is a planned reduction of 10% to 15% of our bid output in calendar 2019.","As the year progresses, we will continue to assess market conditions and evaluate the need to make further adjustments to right size our inventory. We are also accelerating our Kuala Lumpur facility closure time line by almost three quarters along with rationalizing other HDD manufacturing costs.","In terms of our second quarter results, revenue in each of our end markets declined on year-over-year basis due to a combination of lower demand and aggressive Flash pricing conditions despite healthy growth in Flash bits sold. We maintain our leadership position across our G-Tech, SanDisk and WD brands in our client Solutions portfolio. We grew up presence in client SSDs during the quarter and delivered solid performance on differentiated Form Factor devices such as iXpand.","Demand elasticity contributed to a strong 30% year-over-year increase and average capacity in the Flash portion of our Client Solutions portfolio. Within Client Devices, while near term demand trends in the smartphone market are soft. Our view on the longer term shift towards higher average capacities remains unchanged.","We achieved excellent momentum in our client SSD portfolio in the quarter. Average capacity for client SSD grew over 60% year-over-year in the December quarter of fueled by an increase mix of our 512 gigabyte SSD at our key customers. For the first time our client compute SSD revenue exceeded client compute HDD revenue.","In data center, devices and solutions we have maintained our position as a leader in aerial density with the highest capacity HDD products. As Steve described the production ramp of a 14-terabyte helium drive has progressed smoothly. We are pleased to have commenced product sampling of our first generation energy-assisted 16-terabyte drive and we are on-track to begin revenue shipments of this 8 flatter solution later this calendar year.","In terms of the Exabyte growth rate for Capacity Enterprise, as we previously stated we are seeing a moderation in the first half of calendar 2019. Based on our customer discussions we continue to forecast year-over-year growth to resume in the second half of calendar 2019.","In Data Center systems we experienced excellent momentum with record quarterly bookings and new customer acquisitions in our IntelliFlash and ActiveScale portfolios. We also had record revenue in our Ultrastar portfolio of storage platform and servers.","For the third fiscal quarter demand for our products is expected to be affected by many of the market factors we highlighted at our Investor Day. These include reduced demand for mobile handsets a continued slowdown investments by hyperscale customer\u2019s inventory adjustments at certain customers and geopolitical volatility.","To conclude my remarks as we enter the New Year, we are confident in the strength of our product portfolio and our evolving market position. We fully expect to emerge from the current soft market environment in a position of strength and in the near term we are taking the necessary steps to effectively navigate current conditions.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview. ","Mark Long","Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone.","Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion at the lower end of the guidance range, primarily due to a decline in Flash, offsetting slightly better-than-anticipated hard drive revenue. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion with a sequential bit growth of 5% and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte declined of 18%.","Hard drive revenue was $2 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was 31.3% below the 32% to 33% guidance range due to a product mix for hard drives that included less capacity enterprise products and lower-than-expected Flash pricing.","Non-GAAP gross margin for Flash was 35% and for hard drives 27%. Continued focus on operating expenses combined with lower variable compensation in the quarter resulted in total non-GAAP operating expenses of $738 million. And non-GAAP tax rate was 14.5% which was higher-than-expected.","We also recorded a GAAP-only charge for various tax-related accruals of $496 million consisting of the true up for the repatriation taxes related to tax reform and future withholding taxes related to decisions about permanent reinvestment in foreign jurisdictions. These are not expected to result in the near term cash payments.","Non-GAAP EPS was $1.45. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $469 million and free cash flow was $24 million, primarily driven by lower operating income and a sequential increase in the inventory. Within inventory almost all of the sequential increase was driven by continued hard drive builds, due to the Kuala Lumpur plant closure.","In the December quarter, we returned to $144 million in dividends to shareholders. We did not repurchase any common stock during the quarter. However, we did repay in full our outstanding revolver balance and made scheduled principal payments reducing our overall debt balance by $537 million.","At quarter end, we had $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and principal debt outstanding of $10.8 billion. As Steve noted earlier, we planned to reduce our annual non-GAAP cost-of-goods sold and total non-GAAP operating expense levels by combined $800 million evenly split between the two line items.","For cost-of-goods sold, we expect to see the full results of these efforts reflected by the end of the December quarter of 2019. And for operating expenses we expect to see the full results reflected within the September quarter of 2019.","These planned actions are designed to reduce our base level of non-GAAP operating expenses before variable compensation by $100 million per quarter including a normal level of variable compensations our new total non-GAAP operating expense level for 13-week fiscal quarter would be approximately $740 million starting in the September 2019 quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the September 2019 quarter will have 14 weeks instead of the normal 13 weeks.","I will now provide our guidance for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Gross margin of approximately 28%. Operating expenses between $760 million and $780 million, which reflect the normal payroll tax reset and other one-time items.","Interest and other expenses of approximately $105 million and effective tax rate of 15% to 17%. Diluted shares of approximately 294 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.60.","I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","I do have a follow-up as well. Maybe to start given the questions that we've gotten through the course of the last month or so, Mark if you wouldn't mind just addressing the balance sheet concerns, your thoughts on the capital structure, the covenant situation as you kind of look at that threshold of roughly $0.50 a quarter in EPS and any kind of thoughts on how you view the dividend?","Mark Long","Well, I'll talk about the first part and then Steve can talk about the dividend. So in terms of the leverage ratio, we are currently in compliance with significant headroom. And as we look forward we are focused on cash flow and we believe we have the necessary headroom through the near term and through our forecast period. And we certainly from a balance sheet perspective have sufficient liquidity to operate our business. And I'll let Steve talk about the.","Steve Milligan ","Yes and Aaron with regards to dividend we absolutely remain committed to our dividend. And so it's as simple as that. ","Aaron Rakers","And then as a quick follow-up. I think last quarter you had alluded to the view that possibly the near line, high-capacity business into the CSP's would see more or less flattish kind of year-over-year growth rate in capacity shift. Clearly the result of this quarter were worse the next expected. And so, as we work through the CSP kind of digestion what's your updated view on capacity shipments looking into the March quarter as well as any thoughts into the June quarter as well? ","Steve Milligan ","Yes just to reiterate our view of the first half is remains the same, roughly flat growth year-over-year. It was our tough compare as you know what's growth resuming in the back half. ","Aaron Rakers","I want to be clear there. So flat year-over-year growth in total capacity ship would put you at -- I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but roughly 50 exabyte which is a pretty notable jump quarter-over-quarter into the March? Is that right? ","Steve Milligan ","Yes. So think about it mark zero growth year-over-year flat. ","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question in terms of your revenue guide. Can walk through how you're seeing contribution between the NAND side of things and the HDD side? ","Steve Milligan ","Yes. So in terms of the guidance, it's about an 80:20 split. In terms of the delta from quarter - our current quarter to the past quarter. ","Mike Cordano","With 80% being flat.","Steve Milligan ","Exactly. ","Mike Cordano","So the line share the decline is Flash related as opposed to HDD related. ","C.J. Muse","And then as a quick follow-up, in the slide deck you discussed price aggression in HDDs and I'm just curious are you seeing that across all verticals? Is that related just a near-line? We would love to get clarification on that.","Steve Milligan ","No. In the slide deck it was talking about our client solutions business of that external hard drives. We do not see any of that within sort of standard devices business. The Capacity Enterprise or any of the other direct to OEM businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Just wondering when you looking at the NAND side, if you can give us some color on what inventories look like exhibiting the December quarter versus the normal and same for the hard disk drive as well?","Steve Milligan ","Sure. So can you go on mute we're getting feedbacks.","Vijay Rakesh","Sure. So I was asking - just wondering if you can give us some color inventory levels on the NAND side exiting the December quarter and hard disk drive as well. Hello?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Once again, ladies and gentlemen please standby.","Peter Andrew","Sherry, are we coming through on your side?","Operator","Yes. We're coming through.","Steve Milligan ","I will restate the answer. In terms of inventory for the past quarter on a sequential basis we grew inventory by a little over $300 million and that was virtually all hard drive related and that was a function of both the bills associated with our KL closures and our return to normal inventory levels for capacity enterprise. So we did not have a significant build from a dollar standpoint in Flash.","On a year-over-year basis, we have grown a little over $1 billion, and it's roughly half Flash and half hard drives. And it's basically, the same drivers for hard drives, but with Flash, it is a function of the cycle and holding more inventory. So that's our current position. ","Vijay Rakesh","And when you look at demand side in both NAND and hard disk drive, one of the hiccups has been the data center demand has been a little bit weaker. I was wondering, what your expectations are? I know you've talked about that it should come back in the second half. What gives you the confidence that it should come back in the second half given that it's still continues to be at very low level here? Thanks.","Steve Milligan ","So the confidence we have is a number of things. Obviously, it's through direct conversations with our customers. It's a combination of the rate of growth relative to their services remains sort of steady and constant. So what they need to do collectively is get through their optimizations as well as in some cases, there are some excess inventory in this system for that group of customers. So a combination of those factors gives us confidence that will see the growth resume for us in both sides of a business and the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","I have one question, one follow-up. Going back to the NVMe commentary and how you're position for new product launch, I want to better understand your value and what is it that you've been able to get some design wins. I'm under assumption that three quarter of the NVMe SSD market is dominated by two and one Korean competitor dominating at least half of the market. And in that context, I want to understand what is it that gives you confidence that you're going to gain traction? And I have a follow-up.","Mike Cordano","So two things. One is the quality of the product we're bringing the market in terms of its relative competitiveness. And you sort of stated one of the other motivations. There is two guys with a lot of market share. They all preferred to diversify. So there is a pull from our customer base on those two factors and they're rather significant.","Steve Milligan","Yes, and the other thing Mehdi that I would add to that is we have to keep in mind that these are our traditional customers. I mean they deal with this across the product spectrum. We are a known supplier to them and so we're able to deliver the right product at the right time with the right cost. We arguably have a pretty good head start anyway given our pre-existing relationships.","Mehdi Hosseini","And my follow-up has to do with TMC in relationship in wafer supply agreement. And I'm just going to ask you and you feel free to how we're going to answer this. Historically you've been obligated to purchase a certain amount of wafer and it's been a cost-plus arrangement. Given all the changes that you're making cut backs on wafer starts and everything and in the context of where NAND process are going and the SSC revenue contribution not in the second half of 2019, how should we think about these relationship? Is there room for realignments of both party would benefit? And should we still assume that the prior arrangements that are based on sustain looking forward? ","Steve Milligan","So two things. No. I'm not sure that you're characterizing the relationships the right way. We have the ability to throttle our wafer start levels on our own. Now there are certain fixed costs that they have incurred. For example building, setting up the building, some of the infrastructure costs that we don't pay directly that we are still obligated to pay for.","And so we talked about this last quarter on our earnings call when we looked at that from the broad economic perspective from a cash perspective we determined that it was more economical given the supply demand situation to cut our wafer starts which we are doing and are in the process of doing and that will carry you through your kind of the first half of this year and we'll continue to evaluate what level that needs to be.","But from your characterization and relationship is not correct. And the economic consequences of that for us were favorable well from a cash perspective essentially.","Mehdi Hosseini","Perhaps a better question would be, will the current downturn, bringing the two parties together? Everyone talks about the need for consolidation. And is this opportunity for a more close relationship?","Steve Milligan","Well that, I'm not going to speculate on that. Mehdi, I'm sure you appreciate that.","Mehdi Hosseini","Would you agree that industry needs to consolidate to better adjust to the industry dynamics supply and demand?","Steve Milligan","I'm not going to comment on that. I appreciate your questions Mehdi, but I'm not going to comment on that. Operator, can we go to the next call for questions please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Hopefully, I got four questions as well. I have two though that I'll stick to. I guess, I'm surprised by the gross margins on the HDD side of 27%, Steve I don't think I've seen that since the time and slot time. So could you just touch on what's going on over there? And how do you see the path of the gross margins on the HDD side 2019?","Steve Milligan","No. Fair question, Amit. And the reality of it is just to be upfront. I'm not happy with the hard drive margins. I'm disappointed by the level there. It's driven by two things: one, weaker or lower capacity enterprise mix, which obviously capacity enterprise hard drive carries a higher-margin profile.","And by the way we are carrying a cost burden in the HDD space, which is the reason why we're closing of Kuala Lumpur and not only the reason we're closing it, but also acceleration of that.","And so as we finalize the closure of that facility and capacity enterprise are mix improves in the back half of the year, we'll see those margin levels to return to a more acceptable and traditional level on the hard drive space.","Amit Daryanani","And if just follow-up, and I realize everyone\u2019s crystal ball are somewhat cloudy these days. But to the extent you could see and look at all the cost reduction initiatives that you guys have up. Do think gross margins in aggregate to Western Digital trough out of the March quarter and they start to improve for the rest of the year, or do you think June could be another soft quarter before things ramp-up in the backups? How do you think the gross margin trajectory from given all the cost reductions you guys are doing?","Steve Milligan","Well, let me give you a little bit. Let me answer your question. I'm going to broaden that question. So let's talk a little bit about how we see 2019 playing out. So let me talk about the top line first.","So we would expect that for next quarter our fiscal Q4 and I'm going to speaking relatively general terms, but this will help all of you. Our revenue levels to look pretty consistent with what we're expecting for fiscal Q3.","Going into the back half of the year we would expect that our revenues will begin to improve for two principal reasons: one, improvement in capacity enterprise volumes as our hyperscale customers return to more normal buying patterns and resumption of growth in terms of capacity enterprise.","And then additionally, let's call it a seasonal bump in terms of our revenue kind of call it across the board both in terms of Flash as well as in other areas. So our revenue will begin to improve.","Now I'm going to start your question on margin for the time being. I'm going to talk a little bit about OpEx. OpEx this quarter in terms of expectations, Mark touched on it is inflated beyond what it would normally be. It's an inflated -- it's inflated really because of a couple of different reasons.","Inflated compared to fiscal Q2, because one we've got FICA taxes that kick in this quarter that for a higher wage or people that will kind of go away as we move through the quarter. And then the other thing is that we had some variable comp, credits that were in the December quarter that will not reoccur in terms of in the March quarter.","So that's why that compared looks a little bit odd. When you then move to the balance of the year, one we've got operating expense actions that we will be taking that will \u2013 the full effect of that will be realized in September, but you will begin to see more of a benefit of that in the June quarter.","So OpEx will be trending down as we move through the year to a $740 million level starting the September quarter. After one complexity in the September quarter's we will have 14 weeks of operating expenses versus 13. So we all need to keep that in mind from a modeling perspective.","From a margin perspective that is always difficult to determine. And it is really the wildcard. Clearly, from a Flash supply and demand perspective, which is consistent with what others have said, we expect that we're going to continue to be under pressure as we move through the first half of the year.","The second half is a little harder to say, but I'm going to tell you what we are assuming. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen, but I'll tell you what we're assuming is that we are assuming that margin pressure in the Flash area will persist through calendar 2019.","Now we're doing that for really one principal purpose from a financial modeling perspective and that we want to have a conservative bias, so we're kind of - I'll call it planning for the worst that is leading us to the actions that we outlined from a cost and expense perspective in terms of either accelerating actions that we are already planned or taking new actions to take cost and expense out of our system.","But it's obviously not fully within our control to say how is Flash supply and demand going to play out as we move through the calendar year, because obviously we've got demand which there is a fair amount of fluidity and uncertainty associated with that right now. And then, we do not have \u2013 clearly, we don't have control nor do we have complete visibility in terms of the production level of our competitors.","I know it's a long answer. What that will mean from an EPS perspective is that you \u2013 is that probably next quarter will look a lot like this quarter in terms of EPS performance. With some level of improvement as we move through the back half of the year with one exception in that we don't know how the 14-week can we make up for that 14th week of OpEx in the September quarter in other words can we get 14 weeks of sales. That's always a challenging thing that when we get 14 weeks. But that's kind of how the year is going to look based upon our current expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Co.","Karl Ackerman","Steve or Mark I wanted to clarify on your - I appreciate all the commentary that you just gave. Thank you for that. But I did want to clarify on your gross margin and OpEx savings assumptions combined equating to a run rate of $800 million. Could you please remind me, how much of these savings are incremental beyond what you previously called out from integrating SanDisk exiting calendar 2020, which if I recall correctly, you expected an incremental $600 million from the end of 2018 through 2020?","Secondly, where are the two largest buckets you expect to extract the $400 million of COGS savings from? And then lastly, how should we think about you reinvesting those savings into strategic growth areas of the market? Thank you.","Steve Milligan","So the first question is relatively straightforward. In that the entirety of the COGS actions are incremental to the previously announced SanDisk related synergies. So that will -- we were targeting 2020. And so these are separate from those. And then, when we think about the primary drivers from a COGS standpoint, these are first associated with our acceleration of the KL closure and rightsizing our HDD footprint.","And then the second big driver is just an overall focus and improvement in terms of our other COGS related expenses on the primarily in the hard drive side. So the vast majority is associated with the hard drive side. I think those were the main points you asked. Was there?","Mark Long","I think there was a last question which I was going to answer. I have lost. I'm sorry I missed that. There was -- do we cover everything? You have a follow-up there?","Karl Ackerman","The reinvestments.","Mark Long","Where do we reinvest.","Steve Milligan","Reinvestment. Yes, so let me comment on that. I'm sorry. Yes. Reinvestment. One other things we make this point. One of the things that we are trying to do -- obviously, we need to tighten our belts, there is no question about that. I mean, it's a challenging market. Margins have been under pressure.","So we obviously need to tighten our belts and we will do everything to do that. One of the things that we don't want to do I've used this phrase before as cut our nose off in spite of our face, right. So we don't want to unreasonably curtail our investments in terms of fundamental technology or in terms of fundamental product offerings.","So those are areas where at present we other than trying to push on efficiencies and things like that we're not making fundamental cuts that we will believe will hurt either our short-term or our long-term competitiveness.","Now that being said, as market conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate. At present that's what we're trying to do and we believe that we can do that even with the aforementioned cuts that we're making in both cost and expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","I guess previously talking about fiscal 2019 cash CapEx of 1.5 to 1.9 and maybe another $1 billion of JV CapEx I assume that hasn't changed I understand you assess that throughout the year. Can you talk about within that budget, what are you planning in terms of wafer capacity additions versus just to kind of more technology transitions?","Steve Milligan","So we are not expanding wafer capacity. So that's all tech transitions that you see from us.","Mike Cordano","And just to address the qualitative side, we do continue to expect to be in that $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion range for total cash CapEx for fiscal 2019.","Sidney Ho","And then my follow-up question is that in your prepared remarks you talked about bit supply crossover of 96 layers in BiCS4 in Q4 of this calendar year. And at your Analyst Day you showed a slide that says cost per gigabyte crossover between to 96 layers will happen sometime in the first quarter in calendar 2019. Is that normal to see a three quarter lack in terms of the supply bit crossover? In other words are there any changes to the technology road map and maybe can you remind us what kind of cost improvement per gigabyte do you expect this year? Thank you.","Mike Cordano","So let me try to answer. That is normal. And that's really the benefit of the technology transition gets you the crossover earlier. But we have to continue to transition the fab to get a bit crossover. So that is standard and normal. And we've talked about this notion of our long-term cost down between 15 and 25. We think this year is at the lower end of that range and is driven as we get more of the production over to the BiCS4 96 layer output.","Steve Milligan","So, going back to the Investor Day, we absolutely standby and \u2013 our ability to have the lowest cost per bit from a NAND perspective. So that belief and conviction remains.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Considering the cost-cutting that you're proactively doing can you help us compare to where that kind of gets us from a gross margin perspective or other actions you're doing? I believe last month at your Investor Day you gave some gross margin guidance longer term 35% to 40% if I'm correct and kind of what you're looking at now is 28% so quite a gap. Is there a road map to get back to that or if timeline or given that industry changes are those of the table? Thank you.","Steve Milligan","No. I think as Steve pointed out, we standby our long-term financial model with the gross margins of 35% to 40% for the reasons we stated at Investor Day. Currently, because primarily of the Flash cycle, we are below that range, we highlighted, we will periodically operate below the range and periodically operate above the range.","And our actions are designed to improve our cost structure as we said a lot of that is focused on the HDD side of things, but we continue to believe that overtime as the Flash market normalizes and returns to a balanced stage, we will get head back towards our target range. But we haven't given a timetable for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Steve this was one of your weaker free cash flow quarters in a very long time. I was wondering, how you're thinking about the company's ability to drive free cash flow in Q1 and the rest of fiscal 2019? And just how quickly can you work down that inventory from the Kuala Lumpur build?","Steve Milligan","So you're absolutely right. I mean, free cash flow if you were essentially -- well cash flow were essentially were slightly free cash flow positive for the quarter. Right now, I mean, obviously, as our earnings compress cash flow terms under more pressure.","I can tell you that what I am pushing the team, in other words, challenging the team is that, I'm going to talk about the current quarter that we remain free cash flow neutral for fiscal Q3. That's going to be a challenge. Certainly, not saying that don't take it as guidance per se. But we are absolutely pushing on cash flow. That is our number one priority.","And so we are looking at all the levers we can from an economical standpoint to maintain a free cash flow neutral position from an operating perspective. And of course, that's before any financing activities whether that's payment of our dividend or any debt -- inventory debt pay-downs that we might have.","And so we are successful at maintaining free cash flow from an operating perspective that would mean that we'd have kind of I'll call it relatively modest decline in our aggregate cash balance ending in the March quarter.","So that's where we're challenging ourselves. But you're absolutely right. And valid to focus on that and it remains very much of a high-priority from my standpoint and accordingly with the rest of the management team.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","The question is on the enterprise hard drive business. Looking at my model, I think units came in at the lowest level since the HGST acquisition. So there's a lot of discussion about the new line portion of that already on the call. But so maybe you could talk about the mission critical piece of that business. I know WD\u2019s prior view has been that's there is still going to be a longer tail of that business and curious if any of the weakness in enterprise hard drives is related to mission critical and how you think your market share of mission critical is trending?","Steve Milligan","No. We've talked about previously. We have exited that marketplace from a new developments standpoint. We are getting near the tail end of our participation from production shipments. So from that standpoint we prioritized investment in enterprise SSD and other areas.","So from an overall market share standpoint, we probably seated some market share in the quarter just reported, but that's really about the end of our \u2013 our end of life shipment scenario.","Operator","And our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS.","Munjal Shah","I had two quick ones. How would you characterize the inventory in the channel and at the customers at current levels? And then on China, did you see any demands, I mean, what is your exposure there and what type of demand trends do you see there?","Steve Milligan ","Let me comment. So I think channel inventories are slightly elevated. And inventory at end customers in certain pockets there's a substantial amount and that's part of the muted demand we see as we came into the quarter.","Mike Cordano","And certainly, I don\u2019t - I mean, obviously people have talked about a softening environment in China in kind of a broad sense. And that's generally what we've seen and it's kind of across the board. I don't think that we've seen anything that is unusual or deviates from that.","In other words smartphone guys are kind of enterprise business. So just kind of a general weakness but nothing that stands out in particular to highlight.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Steve Milligan","So thank you very much for joining us and we certainly look forward to continuing our dialogue. So have a great rest of the day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Milligan","Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon. Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range and non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. Our performance reflects strong execution in our product roadmap, success in increasing our hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash environment. Notably, these results reinforce our prior comments that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle.","We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives in December. These drives feature our energy-assisted magnetic recording technology providing unrivaled areal density and TCO benefits. We expect to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of calendar 2020. Our 14-terabyte platform is performing well, and customer interest in our air based 10-terabyte drive is quite high.","The strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow us to maintain our leading market share position. We achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe design wins, including at another major hyperscale customer positioning us for continued revenue growth and share gains. We made it an important announcement this afternoon of our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5, with 112 layers of vertical storage. BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest density and most advanced 3D NAND to date, delivering exceptional performance and reliability.","Our team executed well in the quarter, increasing our hard drive non-GAAP gross margins to approximately 31% from 28.5% in the prior quarter. We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020 with continued improvement through the end of the year.","I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Mike Cordano","Thank you and good afternoon. Our December results reflect solid product execution, an increase in hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash market environment. ","Data Center Devices and Solutions, we executed well in delivering new products, positioning us for continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020. In capacity enterprise drives, close collaboration between our head, media, and mechanical design teams allowed us to simultaneously introduce energy-assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple-stage actuator in our new 16, 18, and 20 terabyte drives. These innovations provide us with continued areal density leadership and a greater design margin resulting in best-in-class product quality and reliability. Our focus on introducing the right technology at the right time, while delivering the best TCO and highest product quality to hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner.","In calendar year 2019, the success of our capacity enterprise product line led by our 14-terabyte drive drove over 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We also started sampling our 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the current quarter. As these drives ramp along with our 10-terabyte air-based drives, we are well positioned for continued leadership.","In flash, we achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share as our NVMe based enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50% sequentially. Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was better than expected. I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin, higher growth, and lower volatility parts of the flash market.","We have secured additional design wins, including another major hyperscale customer, which demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base. In calendar year 2020, we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue as we move towards our goal of 20% market share.","Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled, built on the breadth of our product portfolio, strong customer relationships, technology leadership, and superior product quality. We look forward to another year of strong growth in the data center market. Client Devices, strong growth in client SSD, and smart video along with growth in mobility and desktop hard drives drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter.","As we enter the March quarter, flash pricing continues to improve. Furthermore, starting in the June quarter, we expect to begin shipments into a new gaming platform. The gaming console market is expected to be a multi-exabyte opportunity this calendar year.","Within Client Solutions, strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue to grow on a sequential basis. At CES 2020, we demonstrated a range of innovative products including the world's highest capacity, pocket-sized, portable SSD and the world's first USB 3.2 SSD exclusively for gaming.","This afternoon, we announced our fifth generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5. Utilizing a wide range of new technology and manufacturing innovation, BiCS5 has significantly increased cell array density horizontally across the wafer. These lateral scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40% more bits of storage capacity per wafer compared to Western Digital's 96-layer BiCS4 technology. We have commenced shipping initial consumer products built on BiCS5 with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year.","We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels, and with strong demand for our products we are experiencing pockets of tightness. These dynamics combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives position us well for continued profitable growth.","I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.","Bob Eulau","Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a year ago. Please recall that the September quarter was a 14-week quarter. By end markets, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was down 3% sequentially and up nearly 40% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, growth in enterprise SSD was offset by a decline in capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage-system business.","Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 11% on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20% year-over-year. As Mike noted earlier, the sequential growth was driven by client SSD, smart video, mobility, and desktop HDD. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash, our decision to limit our participation in mobility, and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives.","Client Solutions revenue was $948 million, up 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by strength in hard drives.","By product category, flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 8% sequentially, primarily related to our increased participation in mobility. Bit shipments were up 24% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, roughly flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Average price per hard drive was flat sequentially at $81. And exabyte shipments were down 1% sequentially. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise.","Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1.1 percentage point sequentially to 25.9%. Our flash gross margin was 19.5%, up slightly from last quarter, as a better pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile. The hard drive gross margin grew more than expected to almost 31% from 28.5% the prior quarter.","This improvement was due to the full realization of the cost benefits of the KL closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive sequentially flat at $81. Operating expenses were $765 million. Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense would have been closer to $720 million.","Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $257 million and free cash flow was $377 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were an inflow of $120 million. As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture.","For the full fiscal year, we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to zero. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. An effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures, we've added a few new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website.","In the December quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders. We reduced debt by $388 million, which included an optional $325 million debt pay-down. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After that, paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities.","At the end of the quarter, we have $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our $2.25 billion revolver remained unused and our gross debt outstanding was just under $10 billion. Total inventory dollars were down $165 million on a sequential basis as both hard drive and flash inventory decrease.","Moving on, our non-GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 28.5% to 29.5%. Please note that this range includes approximately $70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million.","The midpoint of the guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense, in selective new R&D investment. We expect interest and other expense of $80 million to $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be around to be between 25% and 27%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.85 and $1.05, assuming approximately $305 million in fully diluted shares.","With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you and congrats on the strong guidance. When you speak of an accelerated recovery here in flash gross margins, can you layout the key drivers of that through 2020 and how you're thinking about the velocity of that recovery and any thoughts on where you might exit the calendar year?","Steve Milligan","Yes, Wamsi, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So, there's really a couple of different things that I would say are going on in terms of the flash market. One, the first thing is as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we believe that inventory levels in \u2013 from an industry perspective to the best of our estimation have returned in the balance or call it normal levels. So, that's one thing that occurred.","The other thing is, is obviously we have been working very hard on improving our product lineup, which is allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles as well as their stickier business, and we believe that that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash business. The other thing is that, as part of all that is, is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer base that that inventory supply and demand is tightening up.","In other words, demand is going to exceed supply this year. And so, we're seeing customers recognizing that. Prices are improving. Right now, that tightness is, it's kind of in pockets. It's not necessarily across the board. So we're seeing pockets of tightness in the market, and as we move through the balance of the year, we expect that that tightness will increase.","And so what that means from a gross margin perspective, last quarter we said that we thought we would see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area. Now, we're saying that our margin profile will \u2013 it will accelerate in terms of that improvement, and I would expect as we move into the back half of the year, we'll see an increasing \u2013 more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back half of calendar 2020.","What that means from a numeric perspective is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our flash gross margins to get into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the calendar year.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. That's great, Steve. Thanks. Appreciate the color. And can you maybe just and you guys obviously executed pretty well in the quarter on the HDD side as you had guided to sort of have those margins step up as well. Can you talk about the path of the HDD gross margins from here as well? Thank you.","Bob Eulau","Yes, I think the way to think about those is we're in a range where we're comfortable going forward. So we will continue to operate around the range that we reported.","Steve Milligan","With a bias -- Wamsi, I would add to that. With a bias for those margins improving over time as an increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise. So what we've talked about is something in the mid-30% range. We're not necessarily saying that that will happen in this calendar year, but that should be the bias over a period of time.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. First kind of keeping on the hard disk drive business, I know you talked about it in the press release or the slide deck, a 100% plus growth year-over-year in nearline HDD capacity shipments. But given the competitive landscape and the questions, I'm curious, what did that \u2013 how did that perform on a sequential basis and how are you currently seeing the competitive environment?","Steve Milligan","Yes, so I think in general, we maintain our leading market share position, call it in the kind of low to mid-50s. We'll see where this all settles out once everybody reports. We expect that to continue right through the first half of this calendar year. And then in the back half, we obviously think we have some opportunity to continue to grow slightly.","So from a product positioning standpoint, we feel very good about not only our 2014, which continues to be the highest volume shipper, but the expected ramp of our 16, 18, and 20 which will occur throughout the year. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will begin initial revenue shipments in the current quarter.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then on the gross margin on the flash side, mix can be a meaningful driver to gross margin. But I'm curious as you continue to execute on BiCS, I guess, it'd be BiCS4 and now we start to talk about BiCS5. Can you just update us on how we think about the cost curve relative to that mix shift effect to kind of take you back to that as you said, 35% to 40% gross margin? And just where are we at currently in the mix of BiCS4 in terms of bits shipped right now?","Mike Cordano","Yes, BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of bits. We\u2019re just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp. The way to think about Aaron, though, is really in this kind of 15% plus or minus annualized cost take down, and certainly we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition. Relative to mix, I would say both product and market segment exposure and then of course the broader ASP pricing environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two follow-ups for Mike and Steve. First on the NAND side and on the game console rather new game console, and this is incremental as I imagine the prior generations are hard disk drive base and now is moving to SSDs. And there are some figures out there. I\u2019m just wanted to see, what is your assumption for the kind of NAND supply that the new game console is going to consume, given the fact that this is incremental. And I have a follow-up.","Mike Cordano","Yes, I think you\u2019re right. It is all incremental. And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our standpoint, because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year, on the hard drive side. I don\u2019t think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks, this is going to be a large multi-exabyte market and we wouldn\u2019t want to comment any more specifically.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, fair. Moving on to hard disk drive, obviously, you\u2019re introducing a new 18 terabyte. Can you help me understand how you\u2019re cost competitive? I understand, your product has a fewer number of plates and as we migrate from 16 to 18. How that cost competitiveness is going to be used to increase market share.","Mike Cordano","Yes. So I think from our standpoint, we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 and 20. And so the platter count to our understanding is, distance with next generation. So our benefit relative to market share is always about bringing the right products in the market in a leading way, getting smoothly through customer qualification and ramping quickly. We\u2019ve been doing that generation over generation for several years. We will do that again on the 18, 16 and 20-terabyte product that we\u2019ll be ramping this year.","Steve Milligan","And we \u2013 and Mehdi, we do have a cost advantage and we would think that, I mean, that\u2019s represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance. And one of the things that you\u2019re alluding to is that, our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for the 16, 18 and 20-terabyte drives that we are using aluminum media versus glass media and that is a lower cost?","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two, if I may. First question is regarding your NAND supply outlook and you were calling for 30% growth for the industry in calendar 2020. Is most of that coming from process conversions and what sitting an inventory? Or is it going to be dictated by adding substantial Greenfield capacity at the K1 facility? And in addition to that, your South Korean peer last night spoke about NAND demand \u2013 industry NAND demand growing kind of high-20s for 2020. How does that play into your capital planning process?","Steve Milligan","Yes. Hey, Karl, one thing I want to comment is, when they were talking about high 20%, I believe that was supply growth, not demand growth. So, but anyway, I\u2019ll let Mike comment on the specifics.","Mike Cordano","Yes. So all the growth, both ours and the industry is technology transition. So our K1 expansion is all about technology \u2013 room for technology transition. There is no way for capacity in our plans going in. And that\u2019s really it, I think that \u2013 across the industry. And just to comment further on where we think, we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth, Steve commented on what Samsung\u2019s comments were. We believe demand growth will be in the 35% plus range this year.","Steve Milligan","Hence, the shortage.","Karl Ackerman","Very helpful. Last one, if I may. Your enterprise SSD market share opportunity is quite significant and I think impressive. But when we think about that \u2013 how much of that is driven by a new server architecture launch this year versus retrofitting existing servers? And I asked because a Tier 1 U.S. based hyperscale are just announced after the close that depreciation will be lower for them in March due to an increase in useful life of their server. So if I could just kind of talk about that a little bit, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.","Mike Cordano","Yes. So no, we\u2019re not dependent on any specific server transition. So what we\u2019re able to do with our NVMe products is when both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space. And then of course, similarly in SaaS, there\u2019ll be a series of new products announced, where we will be designed. And so we\u2019re not dependent on any particular server transition and it\u2019s really the power of and strength for the product portfolio as well as the customer\u2019s view of us as a preferred supplier that\u2019s driving that share growth.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you.","Mike Cordano","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just going back \u2013 two for me as well. On the HDD side, can you just talk a little bit about as 16, 18 and 20 ramp through the year just for your nearline business? What do you think the gross margin in ASP impacts will be there? And then on the NAND side, there was early comment, you talked a little bit about mix. Could you just give us a sense as to the dilution from mobile? And should we expect more or less participation in that market as we move through calendar 2020. Thank you.","Bob Eulau","Yes. Tim, this is Bob. So the first one on the hard drive, and we have not been giving specifics on capacity enterprise margins, but they are better than average. And as we\u2019ve said before, as our mix trends towards more and more across the enterprise, we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up into the mid-30% range. So that\u2019ll be a benefit to us. And from \u2013 on the mix question, I mean, we\u2019re not \u2013 also not able to get specific, in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was that mobile, but it obviously was a dilutive to us this quarter. And over time, we\u2019ll always participate some in the mobile market, but we\u2019ll continue to manage that.","Steve Milligan","Yes. And I add the flash supply demand situation tightens up, we will see the mobile market become more attractive for us from a gross margin perspective.","Tim Long","Okay. Good point. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the planning process behind the CapEx at the JV level on NAND. To the extent that you guys are feeling better about the business and where profitability is going. Do you feel the need to change CapEx at the JV? And then I guess, sort of second half of that question, you said earlier that \u2013 earlier in the year that you can sort of get the industry big growth without a lot of CapEx, because you won\u2019t have the fab shut down, you won\u2019t have the power outage. Can you just update us on your thinking of how that impacts your supply growth for the calendar year?","Steve Milligan","Yes. I\u2019ll comment overall on the CapEx in terms of that growth and that sort of thing. I mean, from an overall philosophical perspective, I mean, we want to be adding a bid supply to the market that is consistent largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective. So we\u2019re not \u2013 as a result of an improving environment, we\u2019re not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plans. But over a longer period of time, we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth and demand. And so that hasn\u2019t changed.","Joe Moore","Great., thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Just two questions from me. I just want to try to clarify at least get some numbers around this or any way to think about it. So when you look at the SSD opportunities, you\u2019re just trying to double your share there for the NVMe, it\u2019s under the statement you guys made in the slide deck. And you combine that with the gaming platforms coming in. How much of that is adding to kind of the overall demands, you guys gave a 35% number. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of this you guys have clean visibility on so we can get an understanding of how much that demand is gaming plus your share gains on the enterprise side.","Mike Cordano","So the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you as independent of our own share growth, right. So \u2013 and in any one of these particular segments. So our view of 35% demand side growth on the year is an aggregate across the industry per bit. While we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and in gaming that's obviously product segment related gains. So we're not going to talk specifically about that. I think you can kind of calculate where we think we're going on the enterprise SSD side given my comment.","Steve Milligan","Yes, add kind of further context to that. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to place our bits in those markets that characterize. I will call it one or two elements. One, opportunities for us to add more value from a product perspective, thereby driving higher gross margin, referring to that is, let's call it enterprise market.","And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier, less volatile so that we can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market. Gaming, yes, it's incremental from a flash perspective, but it also tends to be stickier business, more predictable. And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our business in more attractive parts of the market. As opposed to, let's call it more transactional or price-driven areas of the market.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Understood. And then just last one, you guys have mentioned like 40% kind of NAND gross margin is kind of the goal you guys want to get to, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how that ramps, is that something you guys think you can exit at in calendar year or is it going to take a lot longer than that? Just looking for any sort of help, when you guys think you can get to the kind of 40% number you've talked to in the past?","Steve Milligan","Well, what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing out in calendar year, we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the year. Now that's not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4 wants to see exactly how the market evolves. But we clearly continue to believe that 40% range is the right level for us and we believe that we'll begin to approach that, I mean in the back half of the calendar year.","Mitch Steves","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about industry bit supply growth in the low-30s and you would be in line with that. Can you share with us what you expect to revenue on a bit basis? And as part of your thinking there, how are you contemplating bits for mobility versus elsewhere?","Bob Eulau","Well, the one thing I'd say relative, we don't comment specifically, but we would expect to have our own inventory positions in quite balanced state. We are entering the year and we expect it to be exiting the calendar year. So to the extent you want to calculate that, that will give you a feel for it.","C.J. Muse","Okay. And you're thinking on the mobility side, is that something that, you\u2019re thinking maybe on the \u2013 you'll stick more to enterprise and consoles?","Bob Eulau","No. The mobility side is not all equal. And part of our effort over the last several years is getting more product diversification, as Steve talked about some of the newer areas. But we will continue to maintain exposure to mobility. We will just manage that exposure and make sure we're making or we're able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve. So we see it as a long-term area of investment. ","We'd see there are some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace. So we'll continue to be investing there. We'll just be able to manage our bid allocation more broadly through this calendar year and into the future.","C.J. Muse","Excellent. And as my follow-up, another question on the NAND gross margins, shocking. But if you could I guess speak to the K1 charges, when you think they might roll-off and how accretive that might be? And also given kind of the state of the industry today, are you running 100% utilization and what kind of tailwind do you see there? Thank you.","Mike Cordano","Yes. So in terms of K1, I mean, we're now having real production runs and we'll continue to have more production as we progress through the year, that this last quarter we didn't have quite as larger charges we thought we were going to, I think it came in around 65 million and I think we had said on this call last quarter would be around 75 million.","In the current quarter, in the March quarter, we're expecting around 70 million in terms of a period expense charge. And that should start to go down after this quarter. And it's really a function of how we ramp production and obviously ability to absorb those costs, but it'll start to get better I think from here.","Bob Eulau","Yes. And one thing just to comment on when I talked about 35% to 40% flash gross margins in the back half of the calendar year, that is inclusive of any potential startup costs that would still remain in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS. ","Munjal Shah","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, two questions. One, could you just update us on the CEO search and then secondly on HDD exabyte, they were down 1% sequentially, but then you talk about 100% growth on exabyte basis on year-on-year, so if you could pie those two as to why on a sequential basis exabyte would be down? And related to near line, what's the visibility into 2020?","Steve Milligan","Yes. So I'll take the CEO search comment or a question, and then Mike can comment on capacity enterprise. So regarding the search, the search process is ongoing. And one of the things that I will add to that is the board is very pleased with the progress that they're making today. And so that's all the update we have for now.","Mike Cordano","And relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace, our fiscal quarter one was a record a shipment for us. Our exabyte share was around 57%. We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind of leading share position in this space, so some of that would be as little bit of a share drop. And I talked about that 53% to 55% depending on where things settle out.","But as we looked into the first half of this calendar year, we see demand across the breadth of the market remaining fairly strong. And we think we're in a good position to maintain this leading market share position that I just talked about. So visibility is good. Obviously different customers have different plans, but when we aggregate it, we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength and demand through the first half of the calendar year.","Munjal Shah","Yes, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions from me, first of all, you mentioned that you became supply constraint on the NVMe SSDs during the quarter. Can you just sort of talk about how you work that through and what it implies for future growth, maybe this quarter, next quarter? And then secondly, I was wondering if you could expand on your comment about the pockets of tightness you're currently seeing, what exactly would you call out, I guess besides the enterprise, but anything you can elaborate on there and where maybe it those pockets expand to in the coming quarter? Thank you.","Mike Cordano","Yes. So I'll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint. It was not a flash supply constraint issue, basically what happened is the demand was better than we had expected and it was some of the components that we use in our NVMe SSD product. We've worked to resolve those and it should not be an issue as we move forward through calendar 2020. And then the other question?","Steve Milligan","Yes. So I think what we're seeing is, in general demand has been very strong across fine SSD, really in the performance categories. So in some parts of the world there are some constraints there and that's being shown \u2013 that\u2019s being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction.","Steven Fox","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the sharp growth in the enterprise, in the NVMe SSD platforms, given the strong momentum on these products and the strong cloud spending environment. Do you think that you guys actually exited the calendar year tracking at low-double digits percentage market share or are we still somewhat constrained on the supply exiting the year?","Mike Cordano","Yes. To Steve's comment, we actually saw a demand in excess of our availability of the actual other components. So had we been able to fully realize that? Frankly we had been in the low-double digits on share. That remedies itself as we're now inside lead time. We continue to see strong demand for those products. And as I talked about, we expect to double revenue in that category year-over-year.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks. And on the HDD side, on the outlook for capacity enterprise exabyte shipments up kind of 35% year-over-year this year, it seems a bit conservative. I mean we're hearing that it's more likely in the mid-40% range or with 60% type year-over-year growth in the first half of this year, just given the continued strong cloud spending trends. So wondering if you can kind of layout your assumptions maybe here in the first half of the year for exabyte consumption just given that cloud and hyperscale spending still seems to be quite strong.","Mike Cordano","Yes, we haven\u2019t been too specific on that. I will say, I will give you a comment that we do see at this time a bias up in demand. So I think that\u2019s reflected in your comments. So, relative to a 35% or so annual expectation, I think our current view is a bias up from there.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, thanks guys for taking the question. Congratulations on a solid performance and it\u2019s good to see the guide you\u2019re really amplifying here. I\u2019ll just stick with nearline Steve; could you just give us a little more context about how you see the aesthetic? And then Mike as well of the cloud cycle through the year, Mike it sounds like you\u2019re saying you expected through the balance of calendar year 2020 now to some extent. Steve or Mike, do you see it potentially continuing? Is this a potential, I\u2019m not asking for a guide, but the potential to continue exabyte demand going up sort of into the back half of the year, is this sort of one where it gets up to a peak sooner, but then maybe is sort of an extended kind of cycle. Any context there would be great. Appreciate it.","Mike Cordano","Let me try to clarify a little bit. We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong. I\u2019ll reference back to the comments I just made. On an annualized basis, we\u2019ve been talking about 35% annualized growth. We do see on an annualized basis a bias up from there. I wouldn\u2019t want to comment kind of any further on, the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarters look.","Ananda Baruah","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that clarification. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Just to follow up on the previous questions, Steve. I guess, we\u2019ve had pretty strong two quarters from the cloud end market here and there\u2019s some concern that there may be a digestion period as you ahead into the first half. And I think Intel did say that, they expect somewhat of a digestion period. I\u2019m just wondering, you tend to have pretty long visibility, especially on the drive side. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any signs of slowdown out there that causes these to kind of, believe that there\u2019s going to be a digestion period.","Steve Milligan","Yes. So again, all customers not created equal. There are some that are doing that, but when we aggregate it, the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes. Hi, guys. I\u2019m just wondering, I saw your CapEx is down for fiscal 2020, keeping the discipline. I just wondering, I should look at the rest of the ecosystem. Are you seeing any aggressive CapEx, or how do you view that? And also on the China side with YMTC as it continue to expand, what are your thoughts in terms of supply coming in with increased or aggressive CapEx given how NAND pricing has been trending? Thanks.","Steve Milligan","Yes. I will comment in terms of overall industry, the extent that there\u2019s public information. But as Samsung indicated and others have indicated, we\u2019re all circling at a bit supply growth rate that\u2019s kind of in a similar neighborhood. With Samsung talking about high 20% \u2013 20% growth rate and we\u2019re talking low or mid \u2013 in low 30s. And so, we\u2019re kind of all aggregating and we\u2019re not seeing anybody adding capacity from a NAND supply perspective that would concern us, certainly not on the short term because it would take up to 18 months for that to become productive capacity. And so, we\u2019re not seeing anybody behave in a way that we think that would upset the balance from a supply demand perspective. So we feel pretty good about that.","YMTC, no real change in terms of our expectations there. We do not see them having any material impact in terms of the market for the next several years. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that depending upon their ability to ramp, not only from a pure production standpoint, but from a technology perspective. But certainly no concerns I would say over the next two to three years in that regard. And that\u2019s kind of within the planning cycle that we would have visibility to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Great, thank you. The question is if you can look at your calendar Q1 guide being roughly flat quarter-by-quarter, which seems to be better than seasonal, especially on the NAND side. Can you talk about your expectations made by products hard-drive versus SLC drives or by segment? I\u2019m just curious how much of that above seasonal goal is a function of ASP improvement for NAND?","Steve Milligan","So let me, I\u2019ll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more specifics. But I mean, if you look at first thing, I\u2019m going to answer it and kind of a backdoor sort of way. If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, which is pretty significant in terms of 25.9 to 28.5 to 29.5 in terms of the range, almost all of that is driven by improving flash environment. So namely pricing, all right. And so, and yes, there\u2019s mix improvements and that sort of thing. And so that directly impacts revenue.","So when you look at an improving pricing environment that\u2019s helping us to keep our revenues, let\u2019s call it flattish on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then beyond that, we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid. I mean, just kind of solid, not great, not necessarily, but not bad. And so it\u2019s just kind of there and that\u2019s both a flash and a hard drive statement. And so that\u2019s allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality drop in revenue in calendar Q1. So are really kind of the two big factors.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes, thank you. And great to see the accelerated NAND flash recovery in the gross margins. I did want to make sure I understand the dynamic that is going on there. Do you expect your own NAND flash inventory to decline Q-on-Q for the March quarter which I think as Micron has commented; they were expecting their NAND flash inventory to accumulate. But for NAND flash prices to increase. So I\u2019m just wondering if you had some color there as far as your expectations on that.","Bob Eulau","Yes, this is Bob. I can make a couple of comments and I don\u2019t want to start giving guidance for inventory by quarter. But we\u2019re still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we saw this quarter. And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least five turns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on internally as a company. So it\u2019ll \u2013 it won\u2019t be strictly linear getting there, but we think we can achieve that fairly soon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to some of the questions about your 18, 20 gigabit drive and terabyte drives that have been released. Can you discuss how the gross margin acceleration or the TAC-2, your target gross margin is impacted by your ability to get those out sooner in terms of the development of those drives? You talked about I think the last quarter the nine-platter was pulled in somewhat in terms of development. How does that help in the acceleration of the gross margin progression?","Bob Eulau","Yes, this is Bob. I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of capacity enterprise. And as I said earlier, is our mix tends more and more toward capacity enterprise that\u2019ll pull up our overall hard drive mix. Our mix was not as good as prior quarters, this past quarter, but you still saw the margin improvement. You saw that ASP stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix. So overall I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise and I think as we introduced a new product, that trend will continue.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark, before we end with a short statement by our CEO.","Mark Miller","Thank you. But I believe the questions I wanted to address about the second half strength in data center and also nearline have been posed. So, I don\u2019t need to posed those again.","Steve Milligan","Hey Mark, good to hear your voice.","Steve Milligan","All right. So thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining.

Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.","Peter Andrew","Thank you and good afternoon. Before I begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward looking statements including business plans trends and financial outlook, based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.","Stephen Milligan","Thank you Peter, and good afternoon everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is Robert Eulau, newly appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will formally take over the CFO role from Mark Long on May 9, 2019. Bob has more than 30 years' experience in various financial and operational leadership roles in the technology industry. And I'm pleased to welcome him to the Western Digital Team.","Robert Eulau","Thanks, Steve. I'm excited to be part of the Western Digital Team and I look forward to working with all of our investors and analysts in the future.","Stephen Milligan","Turning to our business, market conditions have generally been consistent with our expectations described in January. That being said, we are encouraged to see demand incrementally improve in certain areas such as capacity enterprise and client compute. Our expectation for the demand environment to further improve for both flash and hard drive products for the balance of calendar 2019 is largely unchanged. And looking at the quarter from a product perspective, sales of hard drives were a bit stronger than expected. Higher demand for capacity enterprise products drove most of the upside and we saw a nice rebound at higher capacity points. We are experiencing a very smooth product ramp with our 14TB product. In addition, we also realized a significant expansion of our presence in the mid-range. Demand for flash-based products was slightly better than expectations; however, prices declined more than we anticipated.","We are executing well on the plans we laid out last quarter, in terms of enhancing our product lineup, driving technology advancements, rightsizing our factory production levels, and lowering our cost and expense structures. We continue to make excellent progress toward commercializing our internally developed NVMe based platforms. I'm pleased to report the commencement of initial revenue shipments of our enterprise NVMe SSD and we are on track to accelerate the volume ramp of this product over the remainder of calendar 2019.","We also commence shipments of our NVMe client SSDs based on 96-layer, 3D flash, BiCS4 technology. The manufacturing ramp and commercialization of BiCS4, which we believe is the industry's lowest cost technology is progressing well. In the second half of calendar 2019, BiCS4 will become our highest volume runner in terms of flash output. In HDDs, we continue to lead the industry in aerial density through technologies such as SMR and energy-assisted recording and are on track to ship our first energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives later this year. From a flash supply perspective, we are continuing our previously announced wafer output reductions without compromising our cost leadership position. We made substantial progress on realigning our cost and expense structure. The Kuala Lumpur manufacturing facility has largely ceased operations and combined with other actions we are already realizing incremental cost savings.","Our focus is on driving long-term value creation for Western Digital and its stakeholders, while prudently navigating near business conditions. Emerging technologies such as 5G open up new applications and use cases creating immense amounts of data. Further, applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, mobility and IoT will continue to generate growing data volumes that need to be captured, preserved, accessed and transformed.","The relentless pace of innovation bodes well for the long-term growth in the data storage requirements and the resulting opportunities for our company. I want to thank the Western Digital Team and our partners for their ongoing support. I would also like to thank Mark Long for his service to Western Digital. Mark has been instrumental in the transformation of the company and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.","With that, Mike will now share our business highlights.","Michael Cordano","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Starting with our highlights for the March quarter, within Data Center Devices and Solutions, our capacity enterprise drive category performed better than expected with demand strengthening as we move through the quarter.","For the first half of calendar 2019, we now expect total exabyte shipments in capacity enterprise to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, if current demand trends continue, we see an opportunity for the category to reach 30% year-over-year growth in exabytes for calendar year 2019 .This updated industry forecast is a significant upward revision from our prior estimate that was in the low 20% range.","Our 14TB capacity enterprise drive qualification and adoption have been seamless and we are leading the industry in this transition. We are in the midst of a significant ramp of this product in the current quarter. We are on track to introduce our first energy assisted 16TB CMR and 18TB SMR hard drives later this calendar year. Compared to competitive solutions, our new products will be cost optimized offerings containing fewer disks and heads showcasing our significant aerial density advantage. Our refreshed product line in the mid-range capacities also did very well and in total, we have meaningfully increased our presence in the capacity enterprise category.","Just a few weeks ago, we were delighted to hear that the Western Digital storage solutions played a key role in unveiling of the first ever image of a super massive black hole. The event horizon telescope project utilized our high capacity helium drives, which performed reliably in harsh, high altitude, and remote environments. This unique event, highlights the fundamental role we play in the capture and transformation of data. In enterprise SSDs, NVMe product qualifications at hyperscale customers are progressing to plan. This product built on our internally developed controller and firmware, complements our other enterprise SSD solutions that are already shipping. Consistent with the platform approach we discussed last quarter, we expect to expand our enterprise SSD product portfolio throughout 2019 in a cost effective and predictable manner, including a version that incorporates BiCS4.","In Client Devices, demand for hard drives for the PC market was slightly better than our expectations. In client SSDs, our exabyte shipments more than doubled from a year ago quarter driven by strong price elasticity. Additionally, we've begun shipping our mainstream client SSD products based on BiCS4 technology. In client solutions, we are very pleased with the success of our external SSDs sold through retail and we have continued to expand our presence in this category over the last several quarters. In the March quarter, we also launched the world's fastest 1TB microSD card, establishing an industry first in the removal products category. Average capacity per unit for flash devices grew 44% year-over-year, reflecting significant price elasticity. From a flash supply perspective, we remain on track to achieve an overall reduction of 10% to 15% of our bit output in calendar year 2019.","Despite seasonal softness in the March quarter, our flash inventory level was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. As we look to our fourth fiscal quarter, we expect to see a full quarter impact from our reduction in wafer starts, which will help to further reduce our flash inventory levels. This combination of stabilized inventory and lower supply growth in flash will allow us to be more selective in how we pursue flash revenue opportunities going forward. In terms of longer term planning for flash, the construction of the building showing what a Japan is on track with meaningful output from this fab expected in fiscal 2021. Based on this schedule and the planned slowdown in our capital deployments, we expect lower flash related capital spending for fiscal 2020 of our 96-layer based products continues as expected, we are pleased to be shipping the industry's leading technology into retail products and client SSDs.","In the June quarter, we estimate BiCS4 to represent more than 25% of our total shippable flash bits. We are on track to implement BiCS4 across our portfolio including mobile embedded and enterprise later this calendar year. As Steve mentioned earlier, we have largely stopped production activities at the KL facility. We have also consolidated our head manufacturing operations from Thailand to the Philippines. These continuing actions are allowing us to lower our cost structure and rightsize our manufacturing footprint to meet long-term demand.","Turning to our outlook, we see a few additional data points indicating incremental improvement in current demand conditions compared to a very tough fourth calendar quarter. Flash pricing conditions remain challenging, but we anticipate the rate of price decline will moderate as the year progresses due to a slowing rate of industry supply growth, elasticity driving demand for higher capacity points, and seasonal strength in the back half of the calendar year. Based on recent industry announcements, we estimate flash industry supply growth to be slightly more than 30% in calendar 2019, somewhat lower from our prior forecast.","To summarize, our current product portfolio is the best in our history. In HDDs, the migration to higher capacity drives plays to our strength in technology and manufacturing. In Flash, our product portfolio in 2019 has been significantly enhanced with the expansion of our NVMe product line for both client and enterprise SSDs and we continue to have brand leadership in retail. We are taking appropriate steps in a challenging market environment to position ourselves for ongoing success.","I will now turn the call over to Mark, for the financial discussion.","Mark Long","Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our guidance range. Flash revenue was $1.6 billion with a sequential bit decline of 5% and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte decline of 23%. The sequential decline in Flash revenue was primarily due to price, seasonality, and weaker sales of embedded mobile products. Our Drive revenue was $2.1 billion, which was similar to the prior quarter.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was 25.3%, below our guidance of approximately 28% due to a $110 million charge or 300 basis point impact incurred for lower of cost or market LCM reserves. Flash non-GAAP gross margin was 21% due to the rate of price productions and the aforementioned $110 million LCM charge, primarily related to an inventory write down of multi-chip packages that contain DRAM. Hard drive gross margin on a non-GAAP basis rose to 29% compared to the prior quarter driven by an increased mix of capacity enterprise drives, excluded from the non-GAAP cost of revenue is a $148 million charge related to the under-utilization of our portion of the flash joint venture fans. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $742 million; the lower guidance as a result of better progress towards our expense reduction targets.","As a reminder, for non-GAAP cost of goods sold, we expect the full benefit of our $100 million per quarter cost reduction efforts to be reflected by the end of the December quarter of 2019. And for non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect to see the full results of our $100 million per quarter expense reduction efforts to be reflected within the September quarter of 2019.","Our non-GAAP tax expense was $49 million, which was higher than estimated due to a quarterly effective tax rate true-up, and the fact that our tax expense is a relatively fixed dollar amount at this profitability level. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.17. The LCM charge impacted and diluted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.37. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $204 million and free cash flow was a negative $110 million, primarily due to lower operating income. In the March quarter, we paid $146 million in dividends to shareholders. At quarter end, we had $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities and our principal debt outstanding was $10.8 billion. Earlier today, we announced the successful execution of an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreements. The amendment provides Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility to navigate market cycles.","Turning to inventory, on a dollar basis, hard drive inventory decreased and flash inventory was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter after the impact of the LCM reserves. Looking into the June quarter, we expect of flash and HDD inventory to decline on a sequential basis.","I will now provide our guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $3.6 to $3.8 billion, gross margin of approximately 24% to 25%, operating expenses between $720 million and $740 million, interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, tax expense between $20 million and $30 million, diluted shares of approximately $295 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.30. Finally, for modeling purposes, please note that the September 2019 quarter will have 14 weeks instead of the normal 13 weeks.","In closing before I turn the call to the operator for the Q&A, I would like to thank Steve, Mike, and the entire Western Digital Team for the opportunity to serve as the Company's CFO. It's been a great experience working with all of you. With that, operator, please begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the today's call. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Steve or Mark, this amendment to the credit facility is prudent, but would you say this is just preemptive versus your expectations of EBITDA and free cash flow generation over the next few quarters, has that changed in a material fashion?","Mark Long","Yes. We took the opportunity to amend our credit agreements because the markets were favorable and this does give us a significant amount of additional flexibility and we were able to do it with very low cost.","Wamsi Mohan","And do you expect -- your expectation of just sort of the EBITDA generation as you look over the next few quarters? How would you care to price that?","Mark Long","This was not in response to any near-term concerns. This was just a prudent move that gives us good long-term flexibility.","Wamsi Mohan","And if I could really quick, Steve you mentioned demand trends were largely unchanged. Could you just talk about sort of what has changed in that capacity enterprise uptake? What -- where do you think that is coming from a customer base standpoint and maybe even regionally if there are some color there? Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","Sure. I will have Mike comment on it I mean -- provide a little bit more detail on capacity enterprise, but as I indicated capacity enterprise was a bit stronger than what we expected, which we were very pleased to see that. Client compute as you will know, PC volumes continued to decline, but they declined at a more moderate rate than what at least we were expecting, one area of a bit of weakness from a demand perspective, which I think is largely known in the investment community is handset volumes were a bit lower than expected, so we did see a little bit of draw down as a result of that, but Mike can comment a little bit more on the capacity enterprise upside that we saw.","Michael Cordano","Yes. Wamsi, I think capacity enterprise it was fairly broad-based. At the highest capacity, I think it would be viewed as sort of domestic hyperscale providers. We saw strength of demand both in our 12TB and 14TB products and then in a mid-range, we saw strength in Asia. So, we saw a fairly broad based strength across the capacity enterprise gateway.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I can real quick. So, first of all -- just kind of thinking about how you rolled up to the guidance number that you've given, particularly around gross margin. Can you help us understand assuming that the Kuala Lumpur facility closure kind of keeps a positive trend on gross margin and also coupled with the commentary of the demand for the high capacity drives. If we were to assume hard disk drive gross margin kind of stays flattish here, it would appear like your flash gross margin looks to be maybe in that 17%, 18%, 19% range. So for first of all, am I kind of thinking about your guidance in the context of flash gross margin correctly and underneath that what assumptions are you making in terms of pricing and kind of cost down discussion as we go into the June quarter?","Stephen Milligan","So, I'll give some overall comment Aaron and then either Mike or Mark can add a little bit more specifics. One of the things that I will highlight if you go back particularly to fiscal Q2 our gross margin levels for the hard drive business had gotten kind of below what we normally expect at 27% I believe is the number. We saw a nice rebound this quarter as we begin to see some of those cost improvements that you noted as well as a better mix in terms of capacity enterprise. We would expect that that would continue and will continue -- and we'll work our way back up into a, let's call it, a more normalized gross margin level in the hard drive space, which clearly implies that given that we're guiding essentially the flat gross margins that we'll continue to see a downdraft in terms of flash gross margins in the current quarter as we see cost -- price pressures continue.","As Mike indicated in his commentary, we expect although of course we don't know for sure that that price decline will moderate as we move through the calendar year. So, it'll take a little bit of time for that to get into a more acceptable range of price declines. So, I don't know if that helps a bit Aaron in terms of high level commentary.","Michael Cordano","Yes. The other thing I'll add Aaron is on the flash cost declines. We've kind of talked about being at the low end of long-term range at 15%-ish. So, you'll have to think about it that way on an annualized basis.","Aaron Rakers","And then just a real quick follow-up if I can, if I think about how you kind of consider a longer term gross margin what -- as we kind of get back to a more normalized trend in the product portfolio kicks in, what do you guys think is a good way to think about what you would consider as a normalized gross margin in the flash business. And I'll end it at that. Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","Talking about the margin range, I think is...","Mark Long","Yes. I mean, I think on an overall basis we are not changing our long-term model at this point. So, we just need to see the industry work off the inventory and the price declines to moderate as we've talked about and then as flash normalizes and Steve talked about the improvements in the hard drive gross margins through the back half, we -- we should see the kinds of dynamics we talked about at the last Investor Day.","Stephen Milligan","Yes. And to put a finer point on it Aaron, if you just look at our model that's high 30's, low 40's for Flash.","Aaron Rakers","So you think you can get there in the back half of the calendar year?","Stephen Milligan","We're not saying that Aaron.","Aaron Rakers","Okay.","Mark Long","No. We're talking about the long-term model. You said in the long-term, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","Hi, good afternoon everyone. I just want to go back to margins, if I could for a second so your margins in there would suggest that you're losing money on an operating level, but how much of your margin decline was due to the near-term costs ramp -- of ramping BiCS4 and your NVMe SSD that may reverse as volumes ramp for the balance of 2019? And secondarily to that, I think you initially announced total underutilization cost would be $250 million to $300 million, we've got probably another $75 million to go and so may you remind us, how much of the $400 million annualized benefit in COGS from your restructuring actions will be realized in June and then taking those two as a whole, how do we think about the margin trajectory at least qualitatively for the second half in that? Thank you.","Michael Cordano","I'll talk to sort of flash cost downs and given the ramp of BiCS4, I just talked about the annualized rate that is more back half loaded, so we see a shallower cost decline in the first half more to come in the back half and Mark you want to.","Mark Long","Well, I think you are exactly right in terms of our underutilization charge with the majority of it occurring in the prior quarter and through this quarter. So, we haven't given a breakdown in terms of the amount of our Kuala Lumpur shutdown benefit that we're receiving in the Q4. But as we said, we will be getting that full $400 million a year of cost benefit exiting calendar Q4 this year.","Stephen Milligan","Yes. The other thing I'll comment on relative to our ability to navigate the market, our inventory position that we discussed being sort of more in check and improving sequentially allows us to be more selective and when we talk about selectivity, that's -- think about it as quality of the business which would be profitability via principle measurement and all that.","Michael Cordano","Yes. I mean if you look at -- I'll provide a little bit of additional commentary, which will be largely consistent with what I talked about at the last earnings call is that you know as we move through the balance of the calendar year. One, starting from a top line perspective, we expect our top line to improve at a meaningful rate as we see demand pick up, capacity enterprise as well as seasonal pickup in demand from both a flash and from a hard drive perspective. That will allow us -- obviously we'll have higher revenue. We will also have more of the benefit of the cost and expense reductions, as we particularly move into the September quarter or then in December. And so, that will allow us to see some lift in terms of our earnings, as we move through the back half of the year. The big question which is the question that you're trying to get at is what is our margin level going to look like?","Let me provide a little bit more color on that, in the sense that we continue to expect that our hard drive margins will improve as we move through the balance of the calendar year. Flash becomes the wildcard, now I said this last call and I'm going to say it again because it really is the same answer. What are we assuming? We're assuming that we're going to continue to see pressure in terms of our flash gross margins as we move through the balance of the calendar year. And the reason that we're doing that principally is that, we want to plan for the worst and if you want to call it hope for the best. Now, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to Flash gross margins because a lot of that is dependent upon other factors that are outside of our control. What do our competitors do, production levels, demand levels, and all that.","So, we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but from our standpoint it is safest to assume that we're going to continue to see our Flash gross margins remain under some degree of pressure as we move through the calendar year, albeit maybe at a moderating level from a pricing perspective as we move through to the back half of the year.","Karl Ackerman","If I may, just ask more of a question on the hard drive business. Steve or Mike, would you endorse that part of the reason why near line demand has been soft at least for the last two quarters, maybe due to a push out in storage raise until these higher capacity near-line drive progressed through qualification? And secondarily, I'd appreciate hearing from your thoughts on how you view the competitive landscape changing if at all from your line draws as the industry provider's offer slightly different near line technologies in the back half? Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","So, I think the principle driver of growth was actually broader inventory levels within the broad based hyperscale levels. So, yes I think there is some modest waiting for the next capacity point that played, let's call it, a secondary role, but the primary role for calendar Q4 and the drop we saw was really inventory levels in them and our customers making an inventory correction. Relative to sort of competitiveness in the back half of the year, I talked about that. I think there is multiple approaches, we're quite comfortable with our approach, it gets there at the next viable capacity point with less heads and disks, which will give us a cost advantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. So, that's the application of our leading technology in a way that gives us an advantage though, from our standpoint we've talked about energy assist being important to us.","As a technology enabler, we continue to be confident that it will give us the benefits we expect and we'll see that in the next generation of products.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. The first question was on the NAND underutilization expenses and if somebody can be a bit more explicit about whether or not you still expect to be taking underutilization in the second half of the calendar year. And then related to that topic, my second question was, asking both now, whatever point those underutilization expenses do stop getting excluded. Where do you think you'll fall within that 15% to 25% annual cost per bit target that the company has for NAND cost downs. Thank you.","Mark Long","Okay. Well, in terms of the underutilization charge as you heard me say earlier, the majority of that will be taken and reflected in the first half of this calendar year. And then a very small portion is left for the remainder as it -- and that is the full extent of our current plan for utilizing the [indiscernible] as relates standing changes to that, Mike.","Michael Cordano","Yes. Relative to any changes as you would expect, we'll continue to monitor market conditions. But at this point, no additional plans beyond what we've already announced. And then relative to sort of the cost implication once, of course we're through that period that's reflected in our estimate of around 15% annualized cost down.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Two follow-ups; Mike, you said near line exabyte growth of 30% 19 versus 18. Is that for Western Digital or is that the industry guide?","Michael Cordano","Yes. Mehdi, we think that's an industry opportunity and obviously we would hope to do a bit better than that.","Mehdi Hosseini","And then, in regards to the NAND bit shipment growth of low 30%. What is your expectation for NAND production bit growth?","Michael Cordano","That is production bit growth, not demand.","Mehdi Hosseini","I see.","Michael Cordano","Supply growth.","Mehdi Hosseini","Supply growth, okay. And then, given your comment on inventory declining for both NAND and HDD into the June quarter, should we assume that days of inventory has finally peaked and is going to decline, looking-forward?","Michael Cordano","We would expect days of inventory be roughly in the same range for Q4 and then to decline and begin to normalize in the backup.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Munjal Shah with UBS.","Munjal Shah","I had one on capacity enterprise. You saw better demand this quarter. Have you seen any indications that the demand for second half could be stronger than what you initially thought, or do you see a risk that we can run into a similar situation as last year, where first half is stronger, and then that can have could be softer?","Michael Cordano","No. Our view and the reason we commented on our expectations for calendar year growth is that we'll see some additional strength in the first half and we believe the second half will remain strong, so that drove our update in our forecast from the low 20's year-on-year total bit growth to approximately 30% year-on-your bit growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess I was hoping first question to focus on gross margins. I believe before you were thinking that you would take the cash charges most heavily in the March quarter and to be more bell shaped and now it appears like June quarter based on your guide is similar at a roughly $185 million and you're now taking further utilization plan charges into the back half of '19. So could you share with us.","Mark Long","So let's clarify that C.J. -- let's clarify so our underutilization charge, the largest portion was in the March quarter. Then we are expecting between $55 million and $75 million in the June quarter and then that will account for virtually all of the -- there'll be just a very small amount that will go beyond the June quarter.","Michael Cordano","Yes. C.J. just to reiterate, we have not modified our production plan at all from the original announcement; so hence what Mark just said.","C.J. Muse","And I guess as you think about the adjustment on the leverage ratio amendment, that was really all about the higher rate that goes into January 20 right so you still have the 4.25 times into September, December that's unchanged. So, curious as you look at adjusted EBITDA on an LTM basis and as you project into the back half, is that something that you're going to need to negotiate in your view today?","Mark Long","No. So that was the benefit of the amendment. The amendment really had two great features. One is what you talked about, which is we pushout step down for our total leverage maintenance covenant from 4.25 times to 4 times. We push out that step down by one year. So, it just provides that additional headroom. Now, the second important piece is, we changed the definition of adjusted EBITDA to increase adjusted EBITDA by the amount of the depreciation for our portion of the JV; CapEx basically that is.","Stephen Milligan","That's billed to us in effect by TMC.","Mark Long","Exactly. But it was previously not included in the definition of adjusted EBITDA. So that was a -- that provided us a significant benefit in the calculation of that leverage ratio.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan [ph] with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","If market conditions warranted basically how much work do you have to further reduce expenses beyond the $800 million annual reduction that you're targeting?","Stephen Milligan","Well, we have not dimensioned that, certainly not externally. The one thing that I will add to that is -- and we commented on this previously is that when we look at let's just talk about our expense structure, forget about the cost structure for the time, but one of the things that we were attempting to not do was to disrupt or harm our future product road map. If market conditions, I mean it's hard to mention this because you don't know if market conditions got more challenging. First off, you'd have to evaluate why they got more challenging and sort of understand that but if they -- if they got more challenging, we would have to take a harder look at our go-forward product roadmap.","Right now, we don't think that's necessary based upon our expectations both from a market perspective and from a financial perspective, but that would be the next place that we would go look from an expense standpoint. And like I said, we have not dimensioned any potential opportunity as it relates to that.","Unidentified Analyst","And any commentary that you could provide in terms of NAND flash inventory that you see in the channel? So we know it's flat on your book, but what's your view in terms of what's sitting out there in the channel?","Stephen Milligan","Well, I think we've seen the channel is getting in better shape. I think it's a little bit of a different story with certain manufacturers and there's a different story with each of them obviously, but our case has been that we wanted to get ourselves in a better position relative to flash inventory. We feel comfortable about the actions we took. We think it's put us in that position. So, we see things sort of trending down from here.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Last quarter, you talked about it previously and now wafer starts will reduce supply by 10% to 15% which you kind of reiterate today. But then, you also said you will continue to assess the situation, with three more months of data, what are your thoughts today in terms of further lowering production and maybe remind us what portion of your best supply is in tuning in right now? Thanks.","Stephen Milligan","So at this point, we don't see any need to reduce our output schedule. We talked about the industry supply growth rate being around 30%, we're at or slightly below that. We're comfortable with that position relative to our production plan given our current view of market outlook. We have not commented on the percentage of output on 2D planar. I'll give you this color, the remaining percentage of output tends to be in long life cycle businesses that have quite good economics. So, we're very comfortable with the remaining percentage of our output that's on 2D planar.","Sidney Ho","Maybe just to follow on that; I think you mentioned CapEx will be down in fiscal 2020. Are there any changes for this calendar year or maybe mixing calendar year versus fiscal year there?","Stephen Milligan","So I think just to dimension it, we'd previously said for fiscal '19, our expectation for cash CapEx would be in the $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion range. And we believe will come in at the low end around $1.5 billion for fiscal '19. For fiscal '20, as Mike indicated, we expect our cash CapEx to be lower, and it should be in the $1 billion range at this point.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","I wonder in terms of the utilization comments you said that utilization charges are winding down now. Does that mean that the supply comes back on in the third quarter or should we be modeling for a step function increase in production in Q3 -- in calendar Q3?","Stephen Milligan","Yes. I think the way you should think about it is our industry growth rate for the year will be at or slightly below the 30% we talked about. We chose to implement it in such a way; we took pressure off of our inventory position in the first half of the year, which is seasonally slow. So, I think generally speaking we think we're well aligned with our view of market demand and our inventory position is in a reasonably good position, as we sort of go through this quarter into the back half of the year.","Michael Cordano","Yes. And let me add to that because when we announced these cuts in terms of wafer starts, we had a -- we had a simple goal, which was to get our inventory levels down to a range that we felt comfortable with. With the plan cuts that we have made, we are moving in that direction. Our intent was not to eliminate all pockets of inventory within the system. That will require other activities. So, we are in a position to be where we thought we wanted to be and frankly, we were talking about exiting the June quarter. So, we're kind of in that spot or moving in that spot, but I just want to make sure that everybody is clear in terms of what we were trying to accomplish as a consequence of the web wafer starts that we made to our production levels.","Joe Moore","And then, secondly on the lower cost of market inventory charge. Can you talk about I expect it's generally moving around -- what makes it move big enough to sort of trigger a charge like that and you expect it to repeat in the coming quarters? Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","Sure. So, with respect to the driver, it has to do with our multi chip package product that goes into smartphones and as we said, these carry the DRAM that we purchase and it turned out one of the reasons it was a higher charge than you might have expected was just a function of the amount of DRAM we had in inventory. And as it relates to future quarters, this is something we evaluate every quarter and this one just was higher than much higher than typical. So we spend time explaining that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva","As we look back at the consumption and digestion in the cloud, what they've procured, purchased, and unused; can we look back and kind of help us understand whether if they just pre-buy a lot of our memory and storage or did they find better efficiencies with cloud to use it and is there still more like compression that's really helping them out. But what exactly was the disconnect of why it's taking so long to digest the inventory situation now that we're kind of coming out of there at some point? Thank you.","Stephen Milligan","Yes. So listen, the lowest -- all those factors are at play, but the principal one that occurred in the tail end of calendar 2018, if you remember, lots of components were on constrained supply, so DRAM Flash and even capacity enterprise. So, in that environment, the hyperscale players are very concerned about availability, about the ability to continue to build out their infrastructure, so they bought ahead of demand to secure that supply line. So once the supply -- overall supply environment began to change, they took upon themselves to normalize inventory position. So, that was the primary driver. Yes. There's always an efficiency effort going on within the hyperscale, but that's generally comprehended within our growth rate expectations, the thing that -- that impacted at least us in calendar Q4 was what I just described relative to inventory adjustment.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would not like to turn the call back over to the CEO, for any further remarks.","Stephen Milligan","All right. So thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing our dialogue. Have a great rest of the day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference, this does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"22412":["Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) Q3 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Bob Blair - ","John F.

Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Bob Blair","Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, the timing of our pending divestiture transactions with Toshiba, capital spending and industry conditions and our financial results expectations for the June quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 27, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. ","In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call for the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor's information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward looking guidance we provide during this call excludes charges related to the Thailand flooding net of other recoveries, expenses related to the HGST acquisition and any impact from the pending divestiture transaction with Toshiba. Because of the amount of these items, it is not known to us at this time, but we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. ","The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. ","I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer of WD, John Coyne.","John F. Coyne","Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. ","We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. ","Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. ","IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. ","Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. ","When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. ","It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continued to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. ","Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks. ","We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. ","With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. ","I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume. ","We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. ","As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. ","We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thanks, John. A summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. ","We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. ","Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. ","Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68. ","OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1\/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel. ","Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. ","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. ","Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. ","Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. ","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. ","Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. ","Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. ","Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. ","We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million. ","HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. ","Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. ","With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that this recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. ","After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals. ","WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both factors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. ","While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home. ","From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion. ","I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. ","With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. ","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","John, I wanted to get your take on the status of the inventory deficit in drives. And so Seagate's talked a lot about their perspective on how short the industry is on drives. Yet when the OEMs talk, it seem to have more than enough drives, the ODMs in Taiwan have similar comments. If you could just speak to where is the deficit in drives? And how long do you think, if there is such a deficit, how long do you think it persists?","John F. Coyne","Sure. I think in terms of mobile 2.5-inch drives for the PC industry, I think we're in reasonable balance. The difference from traditional situation is that the inventory instead of being in HDD industry, JIT hubs is in the OEM's own inventory, the PC manufacturers and the ODMs. So as of today, I believe the majority of that business is being done on a direct ship from factory basis so that, that inventory shifted from HDD-owned to customer-owned. And we think that, that business is in reasonable balance relative to supply and demand and traditional inventory levels. The desktop, we think is a little short, and we'll, from an OEM perspective, we'll take through this quarter to approach a balanced situation. Likewise, in -- on the enterprise side, we think performance enterprise is reasonably balanced, capacity enterprise demand continues to exceed supply. And then when we move into the distribution channels, we're looking at inventory levels in the distribution channels that are substantially below those that were the norm pre-flood, about half the level that was typically carried pre-flood and when we look in the retail channels, a similar situation, inventories are still somewhat light. So I think we're going to see...","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Very helpful, John. Just my follow-up then will be is what's your expectations for September quarter, the ability to drive manufacturing, what do you say the unit TAM per output would be from September quarter? And then I'll cede the floor.","John F. Coyne","Well, I think we're looking at a difficult to predict situation in that. This quarter, our estimate of the TAM supposes a 10% quarter-over-quarter growth. If we look seasonally on a traditional basis, we would have expected a flat to down demand relative to last quarter. We think that's a pent-up issue that creates that both back towards normal. We're still, I think, about 4% on a year-over-year, the 160 number for the June quarter would be compared with 166 a year ago. So there's still a little bit of catch up to do to get -- then we expect in the back of the year, we'll see typical quarter-over-quarter progression that tends to be in the 10% range. And that will translate into very substantially year-over-year increases obviously because of the flood impact in October.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments about being able to meet demand in the quarter. I mean, is that much more of a function of whether it's sourcing from TDK heads or, I guess, Hitachi's in-house ability to meet its own needs versus actually building all those sliders out of Thailand and back to pre-flood production capability in-house?","John F. Coyne","Yes, Rich. The comment relates to our ability to satisfy customers with the drive-level product through both our subsidiaries. And we believe we'll be in a good position this quarter to turn our focus from building raw capacity to turning our focus to matching mix requirements within the overall capacity required by our customers in the current quarter. As I think, both I and Wolfgang noted in our prepared remarks, we still have a significant installed capacity under absorption issue from a cost perspective in the WD sub. And we are currently sourcing above the typical WD external\/internal head sourcing rule, our business model that we have set for the long-term. However, as we look forward, we forecast continuing TAM growth each quarter through the balance of the year. And then sustained growth in the industry as we move forward from there. So looked at in a medium to long-term perspective, we're very excited by the opportunities, and we see substantial opportunity for us to continue to improve performance as those cost drags on the business are eliminated by growth as we move forward.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, regarding your comments about Hitachi signing of a few LTAs at lower prices than March., can you give some quantification of just how far below and what markets might have been involved, and more importantly, your ability to perhaps prevent that type of decision-making in the future within the confines of the Chinese regulators?","John F. Coyne","Well, I think, I mean, you kind of characterized; that, that might not have been a desirable action. I believe it is a highly desirable action to provide assurance of security or supply to customers and to be competitive in addressing market opportunity, thereby, increasing business with certain customers and securing that business into the future. So while the prices are lower in the June quarter than they were in the March quarter based on the total package offered to those customers, business is highly desirable and significantly accretive to the overall well-being of the business. So we're explaining the dynamics of the current market not indicating any kind of problem.","Operator","Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I don't know if you can do this or not, but last quarter you talked about an expectation that your average capacity per drive would be down sequentially in the March quarter. Can you provide us any color on what that look like this quarter as we think about optimizing the mix? And what you are expecting them to be into the June quarter? And then I do have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. The average capacity last quarter was indeed down in all the WD business, lowest single-digit percentage. And we expect that mix to pick up this quarter for the WD sub. The HGST sub mix is a little bit impacted that -- since the June quarter was a quarter where the gaming business picked up and there's a more substantial volume of gaming units and that impacts the mix there.","John F. Coyne","But you could -- you should also assume that as we move through the balance of the year, we will return and both business is likely to operate at market mix.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then my follow-up question is on your guys' slide deck, you guys have a highlighted business model, gross margin, which looks like it's the prior model of 18% to 23%, 9% to 10% OpEx to revenue. I'm curious, is that the model you're out and want to talk to the Street about? Or is that just an old -- reference to the old model because I think guys have given flavor for higher gross margins in particular post the; Hitachi? Any color on how you're thinking about the long-term model and the context of that?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Good observation, Aaron. It's the old model. We haven't officially updated our model. We expect to do so in our September Investor Day. We've given some directional color in the supplemental information that we've provided right when the acquisition closed in -- on March 8, I believe. And from that directional guidance, you can imply that we believe that the gross margin is slightly higher than the June 19 to 24 that we said a year ago. And we also highlighted that the OpEx might be a little bit higher and well, you have to wait for the outcome of the operating plan, operations plan that we're concluding with MOFCOM to specify that. And again, the go-forward model will be communicated at the Investor Day on September 13.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And on that, it looks like you're implying about a 30% to 31% gross margin this current quarter. Is that fair?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","For guidance for the current quarter, that's correct.","Operator","Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","2 questions if I could. One, I'm just wondering -- I know you didn't in this, but I want to know if you're planning to or not to report or give even any color on the split between WD and HGST units. And then separate from that, if I look at your OpEx guidance of $550 million, it would imply no cost savings from HGST, which I get and I understand, as you guys have communicated, obviously the regulatory constraints. But are there not even any amount of OpEx cut there or savings or synergies you think you're actually be able to get the near-term before 2 years?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. Well, so the -- on your first question, we're not planning in the future to split out the 2 businesses. We're going to split out what the SEC requires. In terms of the $550 million in OpEx, like we said, we've submitted the operations plan to MOFCOM. We're working on certain synergy proposals that are compliant with this plan and what we're going to report what these synergies are when we have finalized the plan with China's MOFCOM.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so that's your most sort of conservative take at this stage or your most realistic, the $550 million?","John F. Coyne","I think it's realistic for the current quarter in that we have to complete our negotiations. Also, I think Wolfgang mentioned, we are continuing to invest in emerging opportunities for hard drives and beyond hard drives. So we're continuing to actually to increase spending in certain areas of the business from an OpEx perspective.","Operator","Scott Craig with Bank of America.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","2 questions. John, can you first address the TAM of 155 million to 160 million, and circle that around with the comments that you think you'll be able to meet full customer demand? Because I would have thought, given the inventories and the distributor being half the level of normal and a TAM prior to the flood level of hanging around that 170 million mark, that you wouldn't be able to meet customer demand here in the near term. And then secondly, Wolfgang, on the guidance for the June quarter from a revenue perspective, can you provide a little bit more granularity on that with maybe ASPs and units and sort of a mix, where you think that's going to be from a customer segment?","John F. Coyne","Right, so this is John. And my comments on the inventory versus demand, I think we'll be able to meet the true market demand. I don't think we'll do much in the way of rebuilding inventories or recreating the traditional model of where those inventories are and the timing between cutting an order and delivering the product to where it's meant to be. We're using air freight almost exclusively today. The velocity through the distribution channel is very high, and I think as the momentum builds in distribution and the volumes get back to pre-flood levels and as momentum builds back in retail, back to -- towards to pre-flood levels, I think that's the first order of business is to fuel that growth and support it. And then the second order of business, which comes later in the year or possibly early next year, is to see the inventory and distribution models revert to a more normal level of inventory and velocity of that inventory.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","And on your revenue question on the $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion, I mean, I highlighted a few elements regarding to WD's situation now being more recovered from the flood and having pricing reflective of current market conditions. John and I both commented on the multi-quarter agreements that Hitachi has put in place. We also talked about the mix in -- on the HGST side that were reflected by gaming, and all that you need to take into consideration that some volume goes away with the Toshiba divestiture that we are planning for the end of May for this guidance assumption. And overall, like we said before, overall, we're operating below market mix. Like John said, we think that we'll make this up over the next couple of quarters. But those are some of the assumptions that went into the revenue guidance.","Operator","Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess, along those same lines, but on the gross margin line, can you give us some sense of kind of how long the Hitachi game is run for? Should we think of them through the balance of this year? And now that you guys think that sort of we're going to be moving in market pricing here for the noncontract business, should we think of the June quarter gross margin guidance as being, I guess, sort of the baseline to work from for the balance of the year and then we can use our assumptions around channel pricing and mix for the noncontract portion to sort of guide our models. Any color there will be helpful.","John F. Coyne","I think there's 2 elements. As always, there's 2 fundamental elements to margin. One is ASPs and the other is unit costs. And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external heads to internal heads and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets and our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, being very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced.","Operator","Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, I want to come back to your commentary about you have a series of upside opportunities. It excites the teams. Some of the research we've been doing suggests that the enterprise system OEMs are a little frustrated by one of your major competitors in terms of the pricing environment over the last few months. Are you with either with WD or Hitachi subsidies -- or excuse me, subsidiaries or both of the subsidiaries seen increment opportunities for dual and triple sourcing for these system OEMs?","John F. Coyne","Well, we believe we've got a tremendously strong enterprise portfolio between the 2 subsidiaries. We believe we have a marketplace that is ripe with opportunity, and we're going to pursue it vigorously.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then a follow-up, just around on CapEx, have there been any instances where Western Digital or Hitachi had to capitalize some of your Tier 1 or Tier 2 suppliers who were hurt by the flood, and how did that play out?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That was not any big numbers there. We supported some supplies very, very early on with early payments, but it was a very immaterial.","Operator","Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you guys just get a little more granular about ASPs? I mean when you back into the numbers, it would seem that you guys are thinking about a double-digit decrease anywhere like up to 15% sequential decrease in pricing. And I just wanted to kind of you guys to expand upon that? Just -- and then I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. We didn't imply any percentage increase. We didn't give the volume number. I think we explained what the assumptions are for the ASP that goes into our guidance.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, the other question I had is that prior to the flood, you guys were doing 58 million in volume and Hitachi was doing close to 30 million. What is the run rate number we should assume? And I think you -- people are assuming around 6 million drives for the desktop assets that's being sold. So what is the full capacity of the new company, the run rate kind of full demand in terms of units? And what you're able to do once we get to the September quarter?","John F. Coyne","I mean, I think it's fair to take in terms of capacity to assume that from a invested capital perspective, you're correct in the 58 and 30 facilitization that was in place pre-flood. You're also correct in looking at divestiture to Toshiba. Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilized that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceive to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM. And I think as we look at the longer term for the overall business, we will, in calendar '13 and beyond, be looking at deploying those previously demonstrated skills of adding judicious capacity to meet opportunity in a timely manner.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Well -- then the final thing is just with regard to you generated a ton of free cash flow, $1.1 billion, and if you have a few more quarters like this, you're going to put away a lot of cash. Is there any additional thinking on returning cash to shareholders of the company? And that's it for me.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. Let me first comment on the free cash flow for the last quarter, which was kind of untypical and highly related to the timing of the acquisition. The way be how you should be thinking about free cash flow, and you're right, this company has the potential to create a lot of cash. If you just take this quarter, for instance, at the midpoint of our guidance and 269 million shares, if you apply the gross margin and deduct the OpEx and then take the $350 million CapEx -- or $357 million CapEx, total amortization and depreciation excluding the intangibles that we just added somewhere to $280 million range. If you assume a constant working capital, no investments in working capital, that gives you a free cash flow around $600 million or so. So you're right, that's very substantial. We're actively looking at the cash utilization strategy. And I pointed out that's one of the topics that we're going to cover in September, and we'll update you then.","Operator","Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Now that the industry is able to meet demand, do you have a time frame for when you think your market share normalizes kind of back to the normal levels that would have, if you consider Hitachi and WD combined?","John F. Coyne","The market share is about earning customers' business, and we think we're pretty good at that. We're going to try very, very hard to be good at that and continue to be good at that. And I expect that, that will be reflected in the position at the end of June quarter, which will be the first quarter of execution with both subsidiaries under Western Digital ownership. And I think that will give a baseline starting point from which excellence and execution from a technology deployment, product portfolio, service levels and value, will then drive forward from there.","Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And when you get to that kind of normalized market share level, what does pricing look like? Are we back to the pre-flood levels? Are we reset a little bit higher? Any other comments you can give on the pricing side?","John F. Coyne","No. I think we have indicated previously and I'll reiterate that expectation that the costs incurred by the industry, both to recover the lost capacity relative to the flood and to de-risk the business for our customers in terms of the moving the supply chain around to create a much less concentrated profile, those things have cost attached to them, and I believe that it will be affected through to the customers. So we expect that pricing in the drive industry will continue to be elevated relative to pre-flood levels. We, nevertheless -- that elevation of pricing notwithstanding, we believe that our drives still represent best value in the technology supply chain for the industries we support. And that, that value needs to be reflected in the business model of the hard drive company like ours and to return to our investors for developing and deploying technology at this level.","Operator","Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just have 2 clarifications. Wolfgang, in terms of interest expense for next quarter, I don't think that you said anything. Can you give us some sense of what you expect that to be with the new debt?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Sorry, I didn't catch. Interest expense?","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's right around $15 million.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","$15 million, okay. And in terms of the units that your shipped this quarter, can you give us a sense of how many of the units were SAS and fibered channels, so pure enterprise versus near-line products either Western Digital and Hitachi combined or separate or whatever?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. We're usually not breaking out that piece. We've always just give then the enterprise number.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Will you break that out in the future?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I have no current plans, but we're thinking about it.","Operator","Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the retail TAM being half what it was a year ago. I assume some of that's availability, but is some of it also cloud storage?","John F. Coyne","No. I don't think it's cloud storage. I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling effect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And a follow-up with Wolfgang on synergies between the 2 subsidiaries, could you talk about that a little bit generically? I assume that some it could include minimizing product overlap, but not really sure what you can and can't do there with the regulator.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. I think we'll address that once we have the operations plan finalized with China's MOFCOM.","Operator","Mark Miller with Noble Capital.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","With a previous comment, there's been a lot of figures thrown around for the percentage of drives that are going to be divested. I think someone mentioned previously, it was 6 million. Can you give us any ballpark figure because we're hearing numbers all over the place.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. I mean...","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Is 6 million being the ballpark of the drives divested?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. If you to -- in the FTC's website, there was actually a pretty good description of the divestiture. And from the number of lines that are being mentioned, you can conclude that it's anywhere in the 5 million to 6 million per quarter capability. And that's probably the best number for you to use that the assets that we're divesting can output in the quarter.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I attribute this more to the greater percentage of long-term agreements, but Seagate kind of stuck its neck out and said that they thought margins would stay above 30% throughout this calendar year. Are you saying pricing will stay up? Can you go any further on that?","John F. Coyne","Well, I can't talk to Seagate's margins, but what I can tell you is we have substantial opportunity on the cost side of our business to enhance our margins, and we will compete in the marketplace to provide value to our customers on a consistent and continuing basis. And now we believe that's what we've done profitably for 10 years, and hopefully, we'll continue to do it profitably for at least another 10 and beyond.","So thank you, all for joining us today.

Our unique platform of diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance, as we addressed a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition.","On a pro forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top-line growth, and we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role and the data storage ecosystem.","For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets.","Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfill the market's growing storage requirements.","Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis.","In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on.","I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialog with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties.","Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures.","In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry.","I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. With several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business, all of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment, and HDD results were largely within our expectations. We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives, and our operational advancements remained on track.","Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our client devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker than expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base, and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD.","Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity.","In client solutions, the strength of our WD, HGST and SanDisk brands, combined with our global distribution capabilities, allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been our relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy.","Turning to data center devices and solutions. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10 terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category.","On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform four years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12 terabyte helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10 terabyte platform and our expectation to continue our generational lead with the 12 terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years.","For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Given certain industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings.","In our JV fab operations, we continued the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently -announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018.","In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND. From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's Fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018.","From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018.","In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities, and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes.","I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mike. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across a broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.","Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter, and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro forma basis.","Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs.","Client solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full-year fiscal 2017.","Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.","Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges-related integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.","In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow, with $178 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaled $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.","We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.","I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%.","Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range.","Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35.","We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll start off with \u2013 and I realize you guys don't break out your HDD financials in detail, but could you perhaps provide some color to help us differentiate your performance in sort of the classic Western Digital performance versus what your competitors saw in the June quarter and especially how that trends as you go forward in the nearline market, please?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. So let me start with a bigger picture. I think for some time, we've been adjusting both our product roadmap and our product investment to try to get that optimized versus how we see the market evolving over time. That is one dimension. The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis and our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy.","But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10 terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year and that's from 10 terabyte to 12 terabyte.","So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions. And just to give you a bit of a reference point (23:53) our legacy hard drive only model, we're operating somewhere near the higher end of that model, to give you a little more flavor.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. That's extremely helpful. And I guess let me just follow up, on a broader basis when you look at the portfolio you have today with NAND and HDD and both sides seem to be doing well, is there an opportunity or are you seeing traction and able to get some revenue synergies in terms of perhaps into a enterprise customer who needs NAND, which is in tight supply, and trying to get higher allocations and drives, as well, or vice versa where you can have better NAND business and you can get more HDD market share. Is that an opportunity, is that something that you're going after right now?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. I think the way you should think about that is, customers see us in a very strategic fashion. It comes down to the breadth of our portfolio and their view of us as a long-term relevant partner. And so that translates to a more strategic engagement, which ultimately turns into a better commercial engagement over time.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the revenue mix, if you could give us an update on how you're tracking with the data center solution. Last December, you talked about the TAM of $23 billion by 2020, and I want to see where you are and what are the key milestones in the next 6 to 12 months, and I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","It's PCS, yeah.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So I think the market size opportunity, we would see, is relatively the same and unchanged. We certainly see unstructured data and object storage, as the most optimum way to pursue that is a strategically viable path. We remain committed and convicted to that. As we've also said we're in a nascent phase of our business. I think we're making good progress. You saw that we brought Phil Bullinger into the company to continue to evolve our capabilities in this area. I would say we're satisfied with progress, but it's a little too early to talk about the specifics.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just as we're trying to better assess the risk or think of the scenarios, what happens if you're not able to secure NAND wafer from the JV? What are the contingency plans?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, right now, one of the things that I would emphasize, Mehdi, is that we continue to secure wafer output. We expect to continue to secure wafer output, and from a manufacturing and operations perspective, the JV remains very healthy.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","And what about the what-if scenario?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I don't think that that's a reasonable scenario to be considered. I would find that to be \u2013 and I'm not sure how to characterize it, but just highly unrealistic assumption to assume that.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions, and I have two as well. Appreciating that you guys don't split out the HDD versus the flash business, I still believe a lot of investors will look at \u2013 kind of thinking about the dynamics between the two, in particular around gross margin. And so my question is as we kind of progress \u2013 and last quarter, you talked about hitting a crossover on a cost perspective with 64 layer, how are we to think about that dynamic relative to what might be left and continued upside drivers to your flash business from a margin perspective?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So let me just talk about that. Our guidance does not assume any continued upward movement in bit cost. So what we've assumed is that we're in a fairly stable period on a go-forward basis. So obviously, as we \u2013 to the extent that remains ongoing, we would expect our margins in our flash business to stay at the current level.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Absent changes in mix and that sort of thing, or customers.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then back to kind of the synergies, I mean when you look at it, you've got still quite a decent amount of synergies to flow through the model. How are we thinking about, let's call it, that remaining $300 million of annualized synergies to be realized exiting calendar 2017 relative to the reinvestment of those synergies into the model?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, two things. First, the synergies that we're providing are \u2013 those are net synergies, with respect to what we're doing specifically for the SanDisk integration. And as you know, those synergies are both at the expense level as well as at the revenue level. So we see continued opportunity to achieve that $500 million a year run rate by the end of \u2013 it's really also the same time period, right? Eighteen months after the deal is about the end of this calendar year.","So we feel very good about that. And as we've said, one of the areas that we've had very good success from a revenue synergy standpoint is in the ability to drive greater revenue in the client SSD space, as an example, by leveraging our strength in the client HDD market. So that's been very successful.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. We've heard a lot from a couple of companies about lower demand levels in enterprise based on higher NAND costs and higher DRAM costs. Clearly, your business benefited from the trends to higher costs, but are you seeing lower demand? You mentioned performance was weaker, and I know you guys have been deemphasizing that. But are you seeing lower demand from customers because prices are elevated? Or are you not seeing that?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So I think particularly as we think about the nearline or capacity enterprise market, as I stated, we've revised down our outlook for exabyte growth this year. The reason for that is really twofold. It is component supply shortages and then correspondingly in some instances the cost of components. So those two things are demand headwinds for us in the hyperscale market or for the industry.","As I also stated, we think we will grow at the predicted 40% rate, and that's really based on our product portfolio and the advantage we have there. To some extent, we also would say it's a similar trend in PCs. We saw PCs being a little softer, maybe down 2%. We think the same thing is in effect there. Both cost and availability is really creating some headwinds for PC makers.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to follow up on the gross margin line, you guys now have been above the gross margin targets for two quarters and guiding higher for next quarter. You've got significant cost savings to come. I guess the question is, is your long-term target the right target because it seems like it should be higher or do you have the view that as things sort of level off in the NAND market that we'll go back to the prior targets in the high 30s for the gross margins? Thanks.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, you're certainly right that we've been operating above our long-term model. And I think at this point, we do feel it's a prudent model, and it does allow us to make the right investments to scale appropriately, but as we get more data and as we continue to ramp our 3D NAND technologies, we will always review the model. But at this point, we do believe that's the right range. But it's not a ceiling, and we certainly do everything we can to ensure that we're operating at the right gross margin level, so that we're ensuring that the financial model is appropriately optimized for the environment, and that's what you're seeing right now.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So, I think Sherri, just to add a little bit of color, this is Steve. I mean we're obviously pleased and will continue to do everything that we can to operate outside our gross margin model from an upside perspective. That being said, this is a factual comment and not meant to alarm anybody, the reality is that subsequent to when we acquired SanDisk, we have been dealing with very favorable market conditions as it relates to NAND. We all know that supply and demand will even out a bit more and it'll become less of a constrained environment.","Or historically, when that happens, is that puts a little bit more downward pressure on your margins. As we go through, call it, that sort of a cycle, we'll have a better idea of what happens in that kind of an environment. We'll use that information and then see if a revision of the margin ranges that we've indicated previously is appropriate. And believe me, as the CEO of the company, we'd be happy to raise those margin levels if we think that makes sense as we move through a bit more time.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon. Continuing that thread, I just had a question, Steve or Mark. Have you guys entered into any strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers to ensure they have adequate supply of NAND? And as a result, do they have to give you volume commitments as part of those agreements? And then the follow-up question is how should we think about 2018? I think a lot of investors are quite appreciative of how you're executing and what the model has been generating. But can you still have a 40% or so gross margin from the balance of calendar 2018? Thank you.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Hey, Mark. This is Mike. Let me talk about the customer engagement. So I think for a number of reasons, customers have chosen to engage on a longer horizon. Some of it is technology access, some of it is supply assurance. And certainly, we are operating on a multi-quarter or, in some instances, well into 2018 basis with customers. And that's some of the reason we feel comfortable making the statement that we've made, that we believe the flash market will stay constrained through the first half of 2018. It's really the way the market and customers are prepared to engage us.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Right. And as it relates to financial forecast for 2018, we just haven't provided that level of granularity although, as Mike points out, we expect to have the first half of calendar 2018 benefit from the strong NAND environment, and we would expect gross margin to benefit accordingly.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Atica (36:46) calling in for C.J. Can you talk a little bit more about your expected synergies from HGST and SanDisk and what still remains to be done there?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. Well, what still remains to be done is to close the gap between what we stated as the Q4 results, so roughly the $700 million in HGST synergies on an annual run rate basis, that by the end of the year, we have a $800 million target, so we expect to close that. And as we always do, our plans are to exceed the goals. But at this point, it's the $100 million of incremental synergies that we need to close the gap to the goal.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Which we have plans to execute on that, by the way.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","We have plans. We're highly confident. And if you think about the COG side of the equation, we have largely reached our internal goal to hit the $800 million, and we are working to close the OpEx side of it, just to provide a little more visibility. On the Schrader side...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","You mean SanDisk.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","On the SanDisk side \u2013 sorry. That's our codename.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","You used the codename, just so you know.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","On the SanDisk side, of the $300 million left to achieve the $500 million target, we're also very confident, we feel we have the plans in place and the momentum both on the revenue synergies that I talked about earlier and on the cost and more the OpEx synergies. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve the $500 million in SanDisk synergies as well.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. And then for my follow-up, can you talk a little bit about your view on further reducing your debt?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, as we stated, we remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plan, and in addition to that, we will continue to review value creation opportunities as they arise. So long term, getting to the investment grade status is still our objective, and we will continue to look for the best way to deploy capital from a strategic standpoint in addition to our deleveraging.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong results. Just one for me, just circling back again to the revenue synergy conversation, Steve and Mike \u2013 I think I've asked about it sort of a few quarters ago \u2013 revenue synergy potential. It seems like it's coming up as a point of topic already just a few quarters in. And so I guess my question is, without \u2013 kind of knowing you're not going to give a guide around it and then maybe you aren't even able to yet, why wouldn't \u2013 I guess asking this way, why wouldn't the revenue synergy opportunity, as you guys have described it today, not ultimately be significantly bigger than the cost synergy side of things, the $500 million?","Just in general it would seem \u2013 not when we see this kind of combination, I just think over the years it seems like a very classic, even less strategic than this revenue synergy for companies could be at least 5% or 10% kind of revenue synergy. And the $500 million on the cost side is I think 2% of the combined company revenue. So I guess, long-winded, why wouldn't there be an opportunity longer term to amplify this to a much more significant degree, like the billions of dollars?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So first of all, the $500 million mark reference is a combination of the two, and it's really timing relative to our original projections. So we would not disagree. We see revenue synergy as a very strong strategic opportunity. We're well on our pace to execute those synergies, and we see more in front of us. So I would not disagree in general with your statements. But the $500 million is a combination of the two, as well as the further out targets that we gave at the time of the acquisition.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Right. And just to clarify, so the end of this calendar year is where we have the $500 million annual run rate synergies for the SanDisk acquisition. And then in 2020 we have $1.1 billion of total synergies. So you're right, we continue to drive all the different synergies, the cost synergies, the OpEx synergies, as well as the revenue synergies...","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Right.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","...for the long term.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Appreciate the clarification. And just a quick follow-up, same topic. Where are you guys just in the process of engaging clients, holistically, enterprise clients and CSPs holistically with the portfolio? Where are you mechanically with that process, as in when do you think you'll sort of have that process complete?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","So it depends on the particular CSP. Some of them were more advanced than others, and it really depends on their product requirements. As we've stated, our enterprise SSD portfolio, although we have some competitive products, is not all that we would expect it to be. That portfolio gets stronger in 2018, which will further enable that process. So that remains sort of a forward-looking positive lever for us as we engage, but we are well underway mechanically with all of them. It's really in some instances where we don't have all the product fits that we need.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Really helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions on the NAND side. How is the 64 layer progressing and what do you expect bit growth on the SanDisk side? And do you see any scenario where you could be blocked, or your supply of NAND could be blocked under any scenarios?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So I'll talk about that. We're making very good strong progress on 64-layer BiCS3 technology, and our yields are very strong, so it's consistent with Mike's prepared remarks. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making on BiCS3 as well as frankly the progress that we're making on our next generation, the 96-layer BiCS4. So very pleased and hats off to the team in terms of the progress that's being made.","In terms of bit growth, we have indicated that the industry growth will be towards the lower end of our longer-term expectation of 35% to 45% and that's for calendar 2017. And we would anticipate that our specific bit growth will be a little bit higher than that. So we'll be slightly exceeding on the industry growth rate. And then, your comment or question with regards to, I guess, being cut off from a NAND supply perspective. It's similar to the question that we had earlier and that is a very unlikely scenario.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. On the hard disk side, 10 terabyte, you guys have done very well, especially last quarter. Do you think there is a sustainable moat there where you can sustain that market share on your 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte going forward? Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, we do. So I think it begins with the helium platform maturity. It's a complex technology to get right, to deliver reliable product in the field, to ramp at high-volume, and that's just the base. We also have a pipeline of other technologies that we think are well-situated to allow us to continue to maintain and protect that lead. So we feel very good about the 10 terabyte, we feel good about the 12 terabyte, and frankly speaking, we feel good about products after that.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller of The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Following up on the last question where you believe you'll sustain your leadership in the 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte helium drives, your competitor has kind of led in the shingled media. Do you see yourself pulling closer to them over the next year?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So I think relative to SMR technology, it's about, from our standpoint, when we deploy that and to what market. I would acknowledge that our competitor went earlier in client and they had a lead on us. We're in the process of closing that. But our strategy has been from the beginning, deploy the technology where most value could be obtained from it and we see that happening frankly speaking at 14 terabytes and beyond and we'll be quite competitive at that point.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","And you said the flash demand supply won't come back into balance until the middle of next year. Do you have any ways \u2013 or do you believe there was any double ordering in the marketplaces?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","So there is always some of that in the world, but obviously, I referenced our engagement with customers and our ability to construct agreements with them that gives us confidence about our position into the first half of 2018. And normally customers, if they believe the supply circumstances would be different, they would not entertain such agreements. So it's an affirming point of view to our general market expectation.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to start off, you made the comments about Fab 6 and availability of output next year. We thought that in some of the filings you guys had made you'd said that negotiations over Fab 6 and Fab 7 had stopped. So I wonder, have things progressed on that front? I mean is that \u2013 have there been developments since the filings on the positive on that? Could you just kind of update us on that? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Sure, Rod. And as \u2013 well, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we remain in constructive dialog with Toshiba and our stakeholders in Japan and that includes conversations with regards to Fab 6.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just, I guess I'll follow up on the same question. And the thing is, Steve, you guys filed in core documents that negotiations had stopped and now you have a high level of confidence that output's coming in 2018. So it sounds like you're pretty confident on the situation there. So I just wonder, has there been positive development in terms of the discussion or is there no development, no change from the core documents I guess is the question?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, Rod. In all honesty, I am not familiar with the details of all the particular filings that you're referring to, so I can't comment on that specific filing. Recognize that the discussions and various things that have been going on with Toshiba, there's been a lot of back and forth, and it's been a difficult situation for all of us including for Toshiba. And rather than talking about the history in terms of the back and forth that's occurred, I can assure you and our shareholders that last week and ongoing we're having discussions with Toshiba regarding Fab 6 and the discussions are constructive.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. I appreciate that, Steve. And then I just \u2013 could you comment a little bit about the hard drive market expectations you have as we look into September? Do you guys expect the TAM to grow into September? Could you give us any idea, kind of color on what you think the overall market is going to look like?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So just a little more color to my earlier comments around both hyperscale and PC. We would expect there will be some seasonal \u2013 normal seasonal growth in the back half, but both of those will be muted somewhat by those factors I talked about. We had previously been looking at about a flat PC market for the year. We now are projecting or planning for down about 2%, and then we also gave color or revision down on industry exabytes deployed in capacity enterprise, which we think will be around 30% which is down from the originally planned for 40%.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Sure.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So we want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21901":["Western Digital Corp.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.","As also a quick reminder, we are also providing a concurrent presentation on this webcast and a copy of the slides and our prepared remarks will be available later today on the IR section of our website, including with our Quarterly Fact Sheet.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter results and wrap up with our fourth quarter guidance. We will then take your questions.","We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter with revenue of $5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.63. Our operating cash flow reflected solid execution supported by healthy demand for our products, particularly high capacity enterprise drives, which achieved record quarterly revenue.","Macroeconomic conditions remained supportive in the quarter with Cloud Computing and Mobility serving as primary demand drivers. The positive third quarter dynamics included continued strong demand for our NAND flash products. Our results in the March quarter demonstrate the power and agility of our platform and a sustained focus on operational execution by our global team.","We continue to pursue a long-term value creation strategy underpinned by secular growth in Big Data and Fast Data applications. Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT applications are fueling creation of valuable data at an unprecedented pace.","The number of connected devices worldwide is expected to grow from 9 billion today to upwards of 75 billion by 2025. This exponential growth will require robust storage infrastructures and purpose-built solutions that allow users to capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data. The Western Digital platform is strategically positioned to play a key role in supporting these long-term growth trends.","Enterprise and hyperscale cloud customers continue to accelerate their CapEx spending to keep pace with the rapid growth in data, and this represents a significant opportunity for our data center storage solutions. In the Mobile market, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities with our comprehensive product portfolio. We expect increasing average capacity in smartphones to be a continued driver of growth for Western Digital.","In a moment, Mike will provide some color on our strong ongoing performance in these categories and update you on what we are seeing in terms of long-term exabyte growth. He will also discuss progress towards delivering high capacity enterprise drives based on our innovative MAMR technology.","In Flash, during the third quarter, we saw the market environment continue to normalize with expected price declines. We continue to deploy our 64-layer 3D NAND technology across our product portfolio and will be ramping our 96-Layer technology as planned throughout calendar 2018.","I am pleased to report that our joint venture operations with Toshiba Memory Corporation continued to perform exceptionally well, and our plans for continued joint investment in Fab 6 in Iwate remain on track. In March, we celebrated the opening of our shared memory development center in Yokkaichi, strengthening the ongoing collaboration among our engineers.","I am excited about the future of Western Digital. The power of our platform allows us to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth, healthy gross margins, and industry-leading profitability. As markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize product and portfolio mix towards higher-value opportunities will continue to be an important lever for managing the business. I would like to sincerely thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support.","With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The Western Digital platform performed well during the March quarter. Demand trends in the Cloud Data Center, Embedded Mobile and PC markets were positive, leading to strong pull for our Hard Drive and Flash products.","Operational execution was solid, and our responsive supply chain capabilities allowed us to optimize resource allocation and product mix. We shipped a record industry-leading 100 exabytes of total storage as we optimized our output during a period of strong demand for our products.","Flash market conditions were as expected, which we have previously described as normalizing. We expect the Flash market to continue to be constructive with the possibility of a constrained supply environment in the second half of calendar 2018.","In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, demand for our 10 terabyte and higher capacity enterprise drives for cloud customers grew substantially, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our exabyte shipments for this category more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. Just a few days ago, we launched our fifth-generation helium drive at the 14 terabyte capacity point. Customer qualification activities for this new product have begun, and we expect commercial ramp to begin later this year. Additionally, we have begun meaningful revenue shipments of our midrange capacity air-based drives launched earlier in the calendar year.","We now estimate that on a year-over-year basis in the first half of calendar 2018, the capacity enterprise market is expected to grow at least 75%, well above our prior estimate of 60%-plus. We are also increasing our previous estimate for exabyte growth for the full calendar 2018 of greater than 50% to more than 65%. Our long-term exabyte growth estimate of 40% remains unchanged.","In enterprise SSDs, our Ultrastar SN200 has been qualified and is ramping at leading Tier 1 customers. This NVMe product delivers best-in-class performance metrics for a variety of workloads.","From a hard drive technology standpoint, we are on track to begin sampling our groundbreaking MAMR Recording Technology in the second half of calendar 2018 with a meaningful production ramp expected in calendar 2019.","Switching to Client Devices, we experienced strong demand for our mobile, embedded, and compute products. Sales of our 64-Layer 3D flash-based iNAND offerings expanded during the quarter. The design win funnel for our iNAND solutions for the connected home, automotive and industrial verticals deepened, further strengthening our position to capture long-term revenue opportunities in these sectors. Our comprehensive Flash storage solutions portfolio for the mobile embedded market covers a full range of eMMC, UFS and proprietary interfaces for a diverse customer base. With average capacity in smartphones estimated to double every two years to three years, we see continued long-term growth opportunities for our mobility business.","From a PC market standpoint, the March quarter was slightly better than expected. We announced our first client SSDs based on new internal controller and firmware technologies. We also announced a differentiated high-performance WD Black SSD for serious gamers, leveraging the same architecture. The expansion of our product portfolio highlights the successful execution of our accelerated R&D investments.","In the Client Solutions category, strong consumer preference for our G-Tech, SanDisk and WD brands delivered healthy year-over-year revenue growth for both our drive and Flash-based products in a seasonally slow March quarter. Our offerings for this market continue to garner accolades. In our Flash joint ventures, Fab 6 operations have commenced and we expect initial output in the third calendar quarter of 2018 as indicated.","The ramp of our BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D flash technology, progressed further, and manufacturing yields approached mature levels. In particular, BiCS3 yields are also approaching levels achieved by our 2D flash technology. This is a very significant milestone that demonstrates our leadership in Flash technology development and manufacturing. For calendar 2018, we expect BiCS3 to constitute more than 70% of total bit supply and the manufacturing ramp of 96-Layer 3D Flash has commenced, with meaningful output expected in the third calendar quarter.","Western Digital's estimate for industry bit growth in calendar 2018 remains unchanged at the high end of our long-term range of 35% to 45%, with our bit supply growth consistent with the industry. Publicly stated estimates of bit growth rates from industry participants as well as market analysts appear to have converged into the 40% to 45% range. The expectations for calendar 2018 bit growth rates reflect the complexities of 3D Flash technology conversion along with some companies utilizing their flexibility to convert 2D NAND capacity to DRAM.","In summary, our strong March quarter results reflect the flexibility of our model to allocate resources and supply to deliver the optimal mix of product. With our unique portfolio, we are able to capitalize on fundamental drivers of data growth and the increasing value of data as evidenced by the record-setting exabyte shipments. With further expansion of our product portfolio in calendar 2018 and beyond, we continue to believe that the Western Digital platform is positioned to deliver the best financial and strategic outcomes in a variety of market conditions.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. We executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on the power of our platform, increased gross margins, achieved expense targets and reduced interest expense, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the March quarter with a strong liquidity position as a result of improving our capital structure and continued strong cash flow generation.","Revenue for the March quarter was $5 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis. The March quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.7 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Our Data Center business continues to be driven by growth in cloud-related storage. As Mike stated earlier, this was led by strong demand for capacity enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue was $2.3 billion, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We had significant growth in Mobile and Embedded products, offset by client compute devices. Client Solutions revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in our hard drive and Flash retail products.","Non-GAAP gross margins was 43.4%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points from the prior quarter driven by significant growth in our capacity enterprise products along with a higher mix of Flash revenue.","With respect to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $850 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and short-term incentive compensation. Our non-GAAP net interest and other expenses for the March quarter was $137 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 33%. This includes $157 million of interest expense for the March quarter, a decrease of $48 million year-over-year primarily due to the recent financing transactions which lowered the effective interest rate on our debt. In the March quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 6%.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1.1 billion or $3.63 per share, an increase of 52% year-over-year. In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 3% year-over-year. As part of our recent financing transactions, we paid approximately $190 million of interest expense in the third quarter that was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter. We continued to reinvest in our business with $411 million in capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $616 million for the March quarter.","On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we generated $3.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 34%. We deployed $1.3 billion on capital investments, resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $2 billion. In the third quarter, we had an increase in inventory primarily due to seasonality and ongoing hard drive manufacturing transformation activities. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $148 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We bought $155 million worth of shares as part of our buyback program.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaling approximately $5.1 billion. In addition, we have $1.75 billion remaining out of our $2.25 billion of total revolver capacity. As a result, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion of available liquidity. Recent capital restructuring activities decreased total debt principal outstanding by $825 million during the quarter to approximately $11.4 billion.","We remain committed to the following capital allocation priorities: organic and inorganic business investments, deleveraging, optimizing our cost of capital and capital structure while enhancing our financial flexibility, and delivering returns to our shareholders through our dividend and share buyback program.","I will now provide our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, gross margin of 41% to 42%, operating expenses between $840 million and $850 million, interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, an effective tax rate in the 5% to 7% range, and diluted shares of approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.50.","I would like to point out that, based on our current outlook, we remain on track to meet or exceed our prior expectations for revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2018. For calendar 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model. Previously, we had indicated that our quarterly non-GAAP gross margin for calendar 2018 would be above the high end of our long-term model of 33% to 38%. We now expect that non-GAAP gross margin will be at least 40% for each of the remaining calendar quarters of 2018.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wonder if you can give us a little more context around the Data Center strength; very nice number there. But just in terms of contribution to growth, how much came from disk drive revenue versus Solid State Drive revenue?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Mark, the majority of it was high-capacity drives, so enterprise hard drive activity; hyperscale build-out as we indicated.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, just as a follow up, with respect to solid state, is the composite revenue of solid state, is that improving versus the last few quarters where it kind of seems like it was kind of going sideways or maybe even down on a year-over-year basis?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Are you talking about a particular part of the market or just in total?","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just in total. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, Mark. I don't know if we can comment. I mean, I know it was down seasonally, but that's consistent with seasonal revenue trends. But we haven't provided specific breakout in terms of Flash-based memory or Flash-based revenue versus hard drives. But we are seeing good momentum in terms of our Flash-based products. And so, things are in good shape in that regard.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last question for Mark. Just given the ability now or the flex in the model with the refinancing recently to buy back stock, how should investors think about the runway for stock buyback over the next year or so? Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, in terms of the buyback, as you remember, we executed $155 million of the $500 million that we had announced, and we did that to take out the hedging shares as part of the convertible bond issuance. And the additional $350 million approximately we intend to execute on an opportunistic basis, and this is part of the broader $2.1 billion worth of authorized buyback that we had reinstituted following the closing of the SanDisk transaction.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the questions, and also congratulations on the quarter. I'm curious on the gross margin kind of trajectory of the business. You guys now are talking about a 40%-plus gross margin. So the first question on that is, should we think about that as potentially raising the long-term sustainable target gross margin range? And then as we think about the mix of the business, particularly around the hard disk drive business, are you now seeing a gross margin in HDDs that is solidly above what the historical range had been? I think was past 27% to kind of 32% range.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so, Aaron, this is Steve. I'll take both questions. In terms of our long-term margin range, we continue to have the long-term margin range of 33% to 38%. Of course, we will continue to look and evaluate whether or not that margin range should change, based upon our experience and what we see from a go-forward perspective; but for the time being, we're sticking with the 33% to 38%.","If you look at our hard drive margins \u2013 and obviously we don't disclose our Flash-based margins or our hard drive margins, but if you look \u2013 just to give a little bit of color, our hard drive margins for several quarters have been very, very stable. And without disclosing the specific number, if you look at this past quarter, driven almost entirely by mix. We actually saw a nice pickup in our hard drive margins and that was due to the strong demand that we saw from a capacity enterprise perspective. Obviously we'd like to see that continue, but we'll have other mix dynamics that will affect our business going forward. But very strong margins in the hard drive space this past quarter.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","And we'll be providing kind of more insights into the long-term model at our Investor Day that we indicated would be in the back half of this year.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And real quickly...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, go ahead, Aaron. But one of the things I wanted to add is that \u2013 because I think this is a really important point \u2013 is that this past quarter, in my opinion, really is a very strong proof point as to why we thought that it made sense to put these two businesses together.","What we've got is, we've got a portfolio of businesses \u2013 or of products that allows us to play across various markets. And you see that you've got very strong margins in terms of the hard drive market. We've got a normalizing Flash market, which means that we're seeing a little bit of normalization in terms of our margin rate there. But when you add that up all together, our margins went up on a quarter-on-quarter basis. I think that's pretty impressive.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, I agree. Just to follow on that though is, I mean, as we look forward \u2013 and you've consistently said, normalizing. Do we take normalizing as being a view that the company can sustain kind of the implied Flash gross margin? And just remind us on where you stand on the cost downside. I think you'd referenced that last quarter, but I didn't hear that this quarter of where you think you can execute cost down on Flash.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, well, I'll talk a little about normalizing. And my first comment, it'll sound like a little bit of a wise aleck comment, but normalizing means normalizing. And what I mean by that is obviously we were in a allocated environment with rising ASPs and that sort of thing, and when we're looking at a normalizing environment that means that we're going to more normal, more consistent ASP declines like we've seen historically in a controlled environment.","So, you're basically seeing even the margin percentage drift down a bit, but in a very measured way. And so, we're seeing a bit of that. We're not alarmed by it. It's still a great environment for us. And so that's really what we mean by normalizing. But as you can see, in terms of what Mark said in terms of our calendar 2018 margins, we're still going to have margins greater than 40 percentage based upon our current forecast, and so that's a pretty good gross margin for us. And so that's a little bit of color on normalizing. And then I'll ask Mike to comment on the cost declines in the Flash area.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So, Aaron, we've talked about, in the 3D era, if you think about on annualized basis, it's between 15% and 25%, and that depends on exactly where the nodal transition is and where we are with sort of capital and footprint build-out. So that's what you should expect, and we remain confident with that. We expect that to happen throughout this year. And a little more color to Steve's normalizing and to add where I commented last quarter, our ASP reductions are largely offset by cost reductions, which does not mean, entirely offset.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","And another factor I think we should just keep in mind is that we get some margin pressure as the MCP revenue increases, which it's doing.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thanks, Aaron.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess maybe first one, your June quarter guidance is essentially implying gross margin is going to be down almost 200 basis points on slightly higher revenues on a sequential basis. Just maybe help us understand. I think you were fairly positive on the HDD commentary there. What's driving the downtick in gross margin by 200 basis points while revenues are very stable on a sequential basis?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, it's really two factors. It's the continued normalization of Flash that Steve referred to, and it's product mix, which is higher gaming revenue for HDD and as I was alluding to, higher MCP revenue.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Perfect. And then I guess, Mike, you mentioned potential constraints in the back half of 2018 on the NAND side. I'm wondering, is that a Western Digital comment or is that an industry comment, given I think the 96-Layer transition may be more complicated for everyone? And in that scenario, if it is somewhat constrained, how do you think ASPs will track on the NAND side for June versus the back half of the year if that scenario plays out?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. So I think the way to think about it is, you got to look at the individual market sectors and how they play and the products in those markets. So, it will sort of play by that. And really what we see is this progression and the challenges at an industry level of making the progression to 64-Layer and then 96-Layer. That's all more difficult than was previously predicted such that the bit growth rate, as you've seen over time, has been at industry level being \u2013 sort of moving in a shrinking direction. So, it's those factors combined with what we expect to be strong seasonal demand in the second half of the year that let's that possibility be in play. And I won't comment specifically on ASPs in that environment.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","But, obviously, that statement that we could be in a more constrained environment is reflective in the gross margin indication that Mark gave for the balance of the calendar year.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter, guys.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Looking into the second half and with your new product introduction, should we assume that the MAMR samples are going to be out? And how should we think about customers sampling? Obviously, this is very critical. And just want to get a sense as to when the PR campaign is going to start and when we would be able to hear from customer and kind of compare and contrast to the alternative technology. And I have a follow-up.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so by samples, meaning we will do that in a broad-based way in the second half of the year. So that will translate to production ramp in 2019. So depending on those customers and how they feel about it, we'll see what they have to say. But I think we'll be very active. We feel very confident in the progress we've made, so we're basically hitting our internal milestones. And the milestone checkpoints we needed to get confident about both those major milestones have been reaffirmed in the recent month or so. So we're feeling very good about it.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. And then, Mark, you talked about inventory upticking due to seasonality and hard disk drive manufacturing. Can you elaborate on it, because the uptick was very significant? Is there a new product that you're building inventory for, or what else is there that led to this uptick?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, it's really two factors. So, the seasonal builds for Flash and HDD is one aspect of it. And then, the second is what you are referring to, the inventory builds for our hard drive manufacturing transformation activities. So that's our ability to reconfigure our manufacturing footprint and optimize our loading of the factories and our ability to evolve the HDD side of the business, so...","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Is that for 14 terabyte that you highlighted that the ramp just started?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Let me add color to that, Mehdi. I mean, basically what you've got is \u2013 you can remember that we \u2013 I mean, although we've largely accomplished a lot of the integration activities, we still are working on optimization activities regarding the remaining factories that we have in our HDD space. What that means is, it means reshuffling production around to get the kind of optimum mix from a variety of different directions. At times, that requires you to build some buffer inventory as you ship from point A to point B. That's all that it is.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, thank you. Congrats on really sturdy results while the cycle kind of unwinds here. I want to start out on nearline. Hope you could put a finer point on where the most activity is today from the perspective of capacity points and how you expect capacity points to evolve over the course of the year and beyond, including your mid-range air drives.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so let me talk about that. I think what we're seeing is very strong growth at the high end, so 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte. That continues on a global basis, primarily with the large hyperscale players. But in addition to that, we see very nice growth at the lower-capacity points, so 4 terabytes, 6 terabytes, 8 terabytes as well. So, as you see more diverse workloads out there, different players optimize around at different capacity points. So the growth is really across the board, but we still see very strong growth at the high end as well.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And along similar lines, the $72 hard drive ASP obviously jumped off the page. There were some (36:02) component shortages throughout the quarter, so I'm curious if you saw those and to what extent shortages either at the component level or the end device level served to boost those ASPs, or is that ASP jump mostly on the natural benefit of rising cap per drive?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so it's mostly on the mix and capacity per drive, but I would describe the overall market as tight. So the demand was very strong and the supply versus demand balance was quite tight.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, a final quick hit for Mark. If you could just remind us of the jump in the tax rate you expect in 2019, and I'll step aside. Thanks.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","So we expect the tax rate as a function of tax reform to go to the high end or just above our long-term model, so in the sort of 12% range.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah, just wondering, on the NAND side for 3D NAND, what was your mix on 64-Layer here and where do you see that exiting the year? And if you could remind us on what the cost benefit was with the transition.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so I said in my statement, 70% exiting.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And the cost benefit was?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","All we said about cost is that nodal transitions allow us to maintain this 15% to 25%. So we haven't been explicit around nodal benefit.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. And I know you mentioned second half 2018 potential for tighter NAND could happen. But if you look at this cost, 15%, 20% down, wouldn't you expect margins to be \u2013 continue to trend up unless pricing comes in a bit more? Just wondering \u2013 we would assume your guidance on margin is a little bit conservative here.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I don't know if I would characterize it that way. I mean, one of the things is that's part of the normalization trend. We have been operating in an allocated environment. And as we move to a more balanced scenario, we will see a bit of normalization in terms of our gross margin. But, on a collective basis, for the balance of this calendar year, our gross margins we expect to exceed 40% \u2013 40%, or greater.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","And that does not \u2013 that 40% rate per quarter does not contemplate a return to an allocated environment.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could maybe provide a little detail on how you are thinking about the calendar year playing out in terms of HD versus the NAND business. The HD business drove all of your growth this quarter and helped you reach the high end of your range. Do you expect the cloud business to continue to be strong through the calendar year, or do you think that NAND business will get a bit stronger as we move into the back half?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so really both. So as we stated on our expectation for cap enterprise, the growth is strong in the first half, will remain strong in the second. That was \u2013 really drove our upgraded exabyte growth commentary. And we would expect that the Flash-based product growth will be traditionally seasonally strong in the second half. So, everything we see leads us to that conclusion. I think our visibility is pretty solid.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So in terms of the year-over-year growth in the back half, you would expect NAND to accelerate in terms of the growth rate versus...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","That's right.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...the March quarter? Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. A couple more, not surprisingly, questions on the high cap enterprise and cloud. So, I mean, a question obviously for \u2013 cloud CapEx is booming here, which is great. What kind of visibility do you genuinely have beyond the next couple quarters? You obviously need some for your own capacity planning and whatnot. How do you get visibility and how do you get \u2013 or can you get commitments beyond a quarter or two? And then I have one quick follow-up if that's possible.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so, Rob, I think our expression of our estimates for the year would lead you to believe for the calendar year we believe we have pretty good visibility, and that comes from a variety of things. Some of our customers, we have longer commercial arrangements and some we have just more tightly integrated sort of, a view of their demand and their CapEx plans. So, it's a combination of those things that give us confidence in that increased estimate.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","And I would add to that. I would add to that, Rob, that \u2013 this is at the expense \u2013 I don't want to sound too optimistic, but there's nothing on the horizon that \u2013 at this point that would indicate that we're seeing any weakness, if you know what I mean. So there's no kind of storm clouds on the horizon regarding the cloud build-out.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. Okay. Makes sense. And then if I can just ask a quick follow-up. Just obviously the upside in nearline, you had weaker, even in seasonal drives and sort of desktop and consumer electronics. Obviously, there's seasonality there, but was there any amount of you needing to allocate head and media capacity to the higher margin nearline that maybe takes away from it \u2013 were you sort of selectively maybe not shipping as much in terms of desktop consumer electronics, or was it just seasonality? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, well, Rob, you really \u2013 you hit on a good point, which I was kind of alluding to earlier in that we're going to use the power of our product portfolio \u2013 the strength of our product portfolio, the depth of our customer relations to allocate our resources to those areas where we think we can derive the most bang. And in this case, clearly, because of the strong demand in capacity enterprise, we felt that it served us and our customers' best longer term to allocate our heads and media to those capacity enterprise opportunities. So you are absolutely spot on.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is now open.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Congratulations on another strong quarter. I'm just \u2013 was wondering, your projections for a tightening or constrained NAND supply, how much of that is projected to be due to improved smartphone shipments?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So I think from our standpoint, we have probably a reasonably modest view of unit growth in smartphones. What's unique to us is capacity mix. So, we look at it as bit consumption, and albeit the unit growth rate has muted in the smartphone industry, we still are seeing the benefit as we did in the quarter just completed of a better mix. So that's what's feeding into our view of demand in the back half of the year.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","And as NAND pricing has moderately declined, are you seeing an expansion in terms of the lasting demand for the product? Are you seeing some new opportunities come up because of the lower pricing?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","I think what's really happening is, that was \u2013 if we go back into calendar 2017, because of allocation, it was actually delayed in 2017. What we've really seen in 2018 as we've entered, is a continuation of the penetration of Flash into certain markets such as client SSD as an example.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we only have time for questions from two more participants. And our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Ada calling in for C. J. You had talked about nodal transitions getting you about 15% to 25% cost reductions. Can you talk about how that changes as you get past 96-Layer and as QLC enters the mix?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So in general, we see that 15% to 25% to be a long-term cost reduction forecast in the 3D era, including QLC.","Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. And then, in terms of your JV with Toshiba, are there any implications for the JV if the sale to the Bain consortium doesn't go through?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","The short answer is, no. When we constructed our, if you want to call it settlement agreement, it was constructed with the intent that it simply protected our long-term interest effectively, no matter who the buyer or owner was of the asset \u2013 of the TMC asset. So, we're not affected one way or the other in that regard.","Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on strong results. I guess two for me. The first is just a clarification. I believe that the past couple quarters, at least quarter-and-a-half, you guys had talked about cost offsetting NAND price declines such that you expected gross margins to be stable. And I just wanted to see if you're altering that outlook at all here. Then I have a quick question after that. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","So, what we've said previously as we talked about the normalizing market was that the cost declines would largely offset the ASP declines. And that's what we've seen.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. So, no change in what you were expecting and (46:52)?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, just for clarification, largely does not mean entirely.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just my question would be, with regards to NAND supply constraint potential in the second half of the year \u2013 and this is particularly because of the comments that Mike made that it's not baked into the gross margin thought process right now; it's incremental if it happens (47:15). Can you just walk us through what you see \u2013 I know you touched on one or two, but can you walk us through what all the signposts could be as you see them that could lead to a supply constrained environment in the second half? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, so signpost number on, we've already talked about, which is our expectation for bit growth at a industry level, which has been coming down sort of quarter-over-quarter in terms of the estimate for the year. So that combined with what we think the demand side's going to look like. So I think we will see \u2013 actually see more clearly in the coming months. But I think there remains that possibility. And obviously at this point, for the majority of our business, we are still not booked out in the second half of the year. So as we progress through this quarter, we'll have a better feel.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Okay.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Okay. All right, thank you. So thank you everybody for joining us today.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter.","At our Investor Day on December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy, and business model, and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With a growing storage industry and evolving data driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers validating our approach to value creation.","We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that began earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drivers, all NAND based products, and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger than expected PC demand.","We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.","We continue to execute well on two key strategic priorities, the integration of HGST, SanDisk, and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND.","In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio spanning removable embedded client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.","As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance we will act to protect Western Digital's interest and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture.","In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink on board as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation.","I'm sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital.","I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the December quarter.","Mike Cordano","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio, amidst the favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating.","We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platform is increasingly aligned with our customer strategic direction. Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016 providing business momentum as we entered 2017.","In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully increased as a driving portfolio of hard drives and flash based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products, as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefitted us further in a seasonally strong quarter. Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.","Switching to client solutions. We experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions.","We announced new retail prospects including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for the MAC. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND based retail products began in the December quarter and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond.","In the data center category, demand for high capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year Petabyte growth for capacity optimized hard drive met our upwardly revised expectation which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate Petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%.","At our Investor Day, we announced that 12 Terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as derivative SMR based 14 Terabyte drive marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched four years ago, demonstrates two true cost of ownership value for our customers and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform.","Notably the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million helium drives reflecting our leadership in this category.","From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and a high capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio.","In our data center solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage system. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continued to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company.","Turning to Silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already began retail product shipments containing 64-layer of BiCS3 and we also expect to launch client SSDs and embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year.","Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer of BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology.","In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab6 along with our joint venture partner Toshiba. Fab6 will provide new cleanroom space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab6 to commence in calendar 2018.","In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform; deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio and technology expertise, along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.","Mark Long","Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalize on our strong product offerings, achieve targeted costs, and efficiency improvements, and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics.","Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.4 billion and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period.","Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud related storage demand. As a result, this quarter we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives, as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs.","Client devices which include both hard drives and flash based products benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones.","In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash based products during the holiday season.","Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.","Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy target, while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth.","Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter driven by the debt repricings and reduction.","Our non-GAAP other expenses net of interest income were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter it will result in lower expenses in future periods. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share.","The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.","In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations with $189 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter.","We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances.","We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annualized basis.","With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.","To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy and investments are on track for the significant ramp of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners.","I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis. As I have previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38% primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.","Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect those to total approximately $800 million consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our cost and at the same time support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range.","As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10 with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions].","We will be taking our first question for the day from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I guess one of the things that stands out is that the near line business or I should say the total enterprise business, your capacity shift was down about 8%, your units were down about 1%, I think Seagate was down 14% sequentially on capacity shift. But the data points that we have seen throughout the quarter seem to be fairly healthy even Niedek recording pretty healthy growth in the spindle motors and enterprise. So I'm curious is are you ceding share to Toshiba what the dynamics look like specifically in the enterprise market and whether or not you are kind of capacity constrained and that was a variable to consider?","Mike Cordano","First of all, I think the year-over-year growth; I talked about in my comments, Aaron. So we saw coming at kind of as expected in around 40%. The other thing I would say is some of this is timing of when this revenue shows up. So from our standpoint we are seeing consistent demand and continued and continued strength and demand there. So I don't think there is anything we would say was outside of our planning expectation. And let me just add to your comment on share, we don't believe we ceded any share in the period.","Aaron Rakers","And were you at all capacity constraint?","Steve Milligan","We are -- this is Steve, Aaron. We are tight on capacity as it relates to capacity enterprise. The amount that we ship was not meaningfully impacted in terms of capacity constraints. But when you talk about this last quarter by the way given there is a large component count, if we saw demand spike in any regard we would struggle to meet some of that demand. But right now we are comfortable with where we are at from an overall capacity perspective but it is we are running pretty hard in terms of our capacity enterprise both in one account as well as on hard drive capacity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is open.","Rich Kugele","Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations as well. Couple of questions I guess first when it comes to the cloud service or rather landscape, your percentage of the business if we include NAND going into that segment, I mean obviously the high capacity enterprises, a big factor there but are you supplying a large amount of the SSD side as well and then I have a follow-up?","Mike Cordano","Well certainly hyperscale is generally a growing segment for us, Rich, and as you know that today is principally SATA based interface, so yes we see that as a growing market opportunity and participation for us.","Rich Kugele","Okay. And then Mark if you needed to access quite a bit of capital for investment in let's say to Toshiba business further, how much capacity do you have on the balance sheet for leverage and or ask maybe another way, what's the minimum amount of cash you need to run the business?","Mark Long","Well Rich let me just say this first with respect to running the business, we have more than adequate liquidity and we feel very good about both our cash balances and the location of our cash. So that's something we are in very good shape on.","With respect to strategic opportunities and accessing additional cash, I would just say we don't comment on anything in particular. And with respect to accessing additional liquidity, we recognize there are variety of ways we can do it, we feel like we have good alternatives with respect to additional capital, if we find an opportunity that weren't accessing more capital.","But at this point, we just feel very good about our liquidity, feel very good about the way the business is operating, and one of the things we should also highlight is all this is within the context of our long-term commitment to deleveraging. So we really feel like we are in a good position from a balance sheet standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I have two follow-ups. The mission critical seem to be pretty strong in December quarter and I want to bit understand what is driving that obviously with NAND and SSD prices going up that may have shifted demand to more hard disk drive and also traditional enterprises have it yet in budget flash. So if you could elaborate on those two drivers and my follow-up question has to do with the free cash flow margin that came in around 18%, how should we think about sustainability of that free cash flow margin into 2017? Thank you.","Mike Cordano","Yes, let me comment first on performance enterprise. I think it's largely the seasonality the year-end purchase cycle that drove it. So we don't see any change in sort of our long-range plans relative to SSD as a substitute for performance enterprise. So we see that as more sort of a temporary effect. I will comment generally speaking on constraints around NAND whether it would be this category or the client category, the sort of tight supply situation is creating our modest bleeding effect for hard drive demand.","Mark Long","With respect to our cash flow generation kind of two things, one at Investor Day, we talked about a long-term range between 37 and 42 days for our cash conversion cycle and we did come in below that range due to strong linearity and some other very good execution by our team. So we would expect that in the near-term we may be at the lower end of the range or slightly below it, but there -- over the long-term as we talked about at Investor Day as flash becomes a larger part of our revenue, we may operate closer to the middle or towards the high-end of that range but that's really a long-term statement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi thank you gentlemen. Just looking at the gross margin this quarter at the high-end of your updated range and the guidance for the March quarter suggest you're going to be at the high-end of the range for your gross margin. So the question is how long are these sort of high gross margin rates sustainable, I know the NAND market is very tight, it seems like there is some decent demand for the higher capacity hard drives but how long should we expect you to stay in this high-end of your range and should we expect you to revert back to sort of the middle of the range at some point? Thanks.","Steve Milligan","Sherry, this is Steve. I would add a few comments. I mean as we talked about before and will reiterate on this call, we are dealing with a tight NAND situation. We expect that situation to persist from a supply perspective through the balance of 2017, calendar 2017. So that obviously has a positive impact on our gross margins.","As well as Mike indicated, we are seeing good mix in terms of our products particularly in terms of capacity enterprise, that's helping us and I think it's also important to note that the margin model that we've talked about one is a long-term gross margin model. That doesn't mean to say that first off that we are not going to stop at 38%. I mean if we can improve our margins beyond that, we are going to do that. And there also maybe sometimes where we actually exceed that, but right now in terms of the current quarter that we now began, we expect to operate at the high-end for some of the factors that I just mentioned.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about Exabyte growth within the quarter and the outlook between the NAND and the HDD business for the following quarter. If we stake out capacity optimizer if you strip out that segment, what was the trend between the NAND and the HDD side of the business as far as capacity goes as we think about that coming down a little bit sequentially. And then as we look at the March quarter, what kind of seasonality do you expect from a unit perspective on the NAND and HDD businesses as well and I've a follow-up. Thank you.","Mark Long","So in terms of the first part and breaking down the Exabyte growth between hard drives and flash, we don't provide that that breakdown.","Steve Milligan","So we would also refer you to the investor material that we had at the Investor Day in terms of Exabyte growth kind of in the revenue growth and that's where I think there is a lot of good detail in terms of that side. If you want to call it segment of the business or market and generally speaking if you look at this last quarter both our growth, revenue growth, Exabyte growth, was generally in line with our previous expectations except for two things, capacity enterprise continues to push up to that 40% Exabyte growth that Mike talked about. And then also we saw a bit better of a PC market which helped us both in terms of our client SSD business as well as our hard drive business. And so really other than kind of a general rising of tides across the board, those were the only two segments that may be were a little bit better than what we expected. And if you can you repeat your second question, I don't remember that, well sorry.","Stanley Kovler","No, no problem. The second part of the question was as we think about Q1, I wanted to ask about the unit seasonality that we should think about for the NAND business and the HDD business because seems like if you are expecting better seasonality at least from enterprise perspective and PC perspective but units on the NAND side typically strong in Q1. So just trying to understand what the seasonality might have looked like between the two sides of the business there?","Steve Milligan","Yes, I think that let me talk. I'll give kind of an indication in terms of total units just from HDD perspective. The TAM came in this past quarter in terms of calendar Q4 at call it 112 million unit range. We would say that it probably would dropped to let's just call it 100 million unit range and pretty much all of that decline is largely due to the PC area. I mean in terms of from a unit perspective. And NAND we would expect to be seasonally down understanding that there hasn't tight supply. So you're going to see a little bit better demand than what you normally would see just from a sequential perspective as well as the fact as pricing continues to remain healthy. So that will help from an overall revenue perspective. So that's just some general guidance for you to kind of work from.","Stanley Kovler","Thanks. And if I could just follow-up, I wanted to ask about the consumer electronics and branded segment of HDDs, can you help us understand what the trends there it's a bit worsen seasonal, any product portfolio shift going on there, should we think about new products coming online in that area as we get throughout the year. Thanks a lot.","Mike Cordano","Yes, actually we really were operating within our expected range. I think we saw a little more strength on the flash side of the business driven by the same factors we talked about, but nothing unexpected there relative to either the HDD base or flash base part of that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect, thanks. Congrats on the great quarter guys. I guess to start off with could you just may be talk about how much gross margin expansion do you still have from the cost takeout from HGST and SanDisk. I think it's a couple of hundred basis points that still lies ahead of you but could you guys help us quantify those two buckets. And if that's still ahead of you then could we operate in the 38% or 40% plus scenario provided the current supply demand dynamics sustain?","Steve Milligan","Yes that's a really good question. I have Mark kind of address the specifics but yes I fail to mention that when Sherry asked her question but yet we still have meaningful synergies. So we had particularly on the WD and HGST side. We also have some revenue synergies and then vertical integration synergies on the SanDisk side, but you are absolutely right. As those begin to kick in further that will certainly help us to maintain or improve our existing margin levels. So Mark is --","Mark Long","Let me just build on what Steve was saying. So as far as the COGS side from the HGST integration, we have achieved approximately half of the $350 million in run rate synergies that we expect to finish by the end of calendar 2017. So closing up this quarter we had approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and another $175 million to get. So you're about right in that ballpark.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough, that's very helpful and I guess may be just on the gross margin side, sequentially you guys are talking about revenues being down on 6%, 7%, 8% in the March quarter, gross margins are still reflecting higher, are they couple of things we would call out maybe it's mix or pricing that's helping but what's enabling such a big gross margin up tick when I would imagine as revenue deleverage?","Mark Long","Yes primarily mix and pricing and then we continue to make progress on our cost improvement operation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hey thanks guys and congrats on the progress and on the strength of the quarter. I guess two quick ones for me. The first is I would love to get your view Steve on the likelihood of hammer products being introduced over the next couple of years. And if you do think there is a possibility for that. What I guess what how should we think about sort of the impact on economics that you guys would see both on the hard drive side and potentially on the SSD side? Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Yes so we talked about it in the Investor Day that we expect that hammer technology will be productized sometime in the 2019 timeframe. There has been no change in our expectations as it relates to ourselves and others have talked about may be earlier than that. But in terms of our expectations, it's 2019.","Now to be perfectly honest about that in terms of the question, the second part of your question, I mean there is two things that we have to do is that we have to demonstrate the capability of the technology so from an area of density standpoint as well as from a reliability and manufacturing perspective. And we also have to enable that technology so that it's competitive from a cost standpoint. Obviously given that we're not productizing until 2019, we haven't demonstrated that.","And our view is that we would look to implement it until the economics or the products makes sense from a commercial perspective and so at this point, we would expect it largely to not impact our financials in any material way in terms of our financial model and that sort of thing.","Ananda Baruah","Got it. That is helpful and then just real quickly, you made prepared remarks about revenue synergy benefit, I guess I was just wondering ultimately how do you guys view what the revenue synergy potential is from adding SanDisk to the portfolio, it occurs to ask simplistically that sort of alters now that you have a whole portfolio just alters the way that you can engage out with the majority of your important customers. And so I guess why would -- why wouldn't there be just super significant potential there over time, whatever over timing when you get it to sort of normalize to really drive very material benefit from that dynamic. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","I think you articulated our strategy very well and the benefits that we're actually seeing today and we expect to see on into the future as a result of our broad product portfolio and the way our teams are now able to engage differently with our customers. So we've seen great traction as Mike has talked about in terms of client SSDs as a great example but really this applies to the way, we manage the entire portfolio.","So that's exactly how we see it and that's why we feel very good about our ability to achieve the near-term $500 million total synergy target that's the 18 months target after the deal. And then the longer-term I think it's $1.01 billion that we expected in 2020, so you're right on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Your closest competitor yesterday reported really significant unit and profit contribution from the non-PC, non-enterprise business that that you called consumer electronics and branded. Are you're not seeing that market do you share the view that new applications like surveillance and NAND will drive growth there and you just late to the party or what do you think the differential is because their business grew 20% sequentially, your business declined 20%?","Mike Cordano","Katy, let me comment on that, we are all like jumping at the bid to respond to that. We actually led the market in surveillance and so what's happening is that our largest competitor is now catching up to the party.","Steve Milligan","Right. So the other part goes to the way we classify this. So when we talk about our client solutions that is our retail branded business both flash and HDD base where things like surveillance show up is in our compliant devices business. So I think you'd expect similar trends that we saw relative to the strength of that business in our portfolio.","Katy Huberty","And can you talk about why over the last year surveillance has become aware of that of a driver of demand and how long do you think that plays out?","Mike Cordano","Well, that's I mean that's kind of I don't want to say difficult, I think that\u2019s going to continue I mean obviously given in the world that we live in and I'm look at the geopolitical kind of thing I mean surveillance is a meaningfully growing part of the market and these are drives that are obviously optimized or those kind of used cases. And I think it's important to note that there will drives but before for surveillance applications may be in a smaller scale, they just want to optimize for those application. And so it does not necessarily mean that it is incremental growth in the overall HDD market it's just a matter of where they're been utilized.","Steve Milligan","Right and I think the positive trend that comes with that market sort of an HDD side is the capacity requirements we get a preferable mix we all benefit from that. The other thing you should think about is that surveillance market is not just the HDD base. So when you think about the broader ecosystem around surveillance depending on the system that close a bit certainly there is an HDD component of it but there is a very strong forward-looking demand that requires flash-based storage when you think about the cameras themselves things that sit on the edge.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Sierra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Rob Sierra","Hi, thanks very much and just kind of couple many comp mentioned at this stage one on your 3D NAND migration can you just is there any updates are or are you still looking at the same targets which I believe were the crossover on a bid basis in calendar 2017, is there any sense as you start working through when it that you exiting still calendar 2017 and same thing on a cost crossover 64-layer versus 2D. And then I guess finally you mentioned Fab6 I think your initial target for the crossover from a waiver standpoint 2018 is that reliant on Fab6. Thanks very much.","Steve Milligan","Yes, so few comments so, Rob yes I mean just a target about what we've to reaffirm what we've talked about in the past is that we expect that the cost crossover 0.4 of that's free technology that 64-layer 3D NAND will crossover against our 1G technology in the first half of calendar 2017 that remains the case, no change in that expectation at this point.","And then the other thing is that what we had said historically is that approximately 50% of our total bid output for calendar 2017 will be 3D based. And obviously the majority of that will be 64-layer because that's what were transitioning to in terms of the cost crossover point. And so no real change on in our expectations in that regard. And I believe on the last conference call we've talked about, I think it was 40% of wafer, wafers out by the end of the year and that expectation remains the same.","Rob Sierra","All right. And then if I could just as look quick follow-up the again kind of confirmation you guys resolved the licensing deal with Samsung in the quarter with straight so that started to help the December quarter again for your positive guide next quarter. Any I mean and if you could give us from how much profit or margin or anything I think wasn't a meaningful help in the December quarter. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","No, in the December quarter was not a significant driver it helps. But we had a lot of underlying strength that really drove the overall performance. So it was a nice addition.","Mike Cordano","Yes and Rob just to be literal we don't have an intention on disclosing the dollar amount of that arrangement with Samsung.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Mark Moskowitz","Yes, thanks good afternoon. I apologize I don't talk for few moments so if it's been asked I apologize but I want to understand firstly is there any area within the business right now in terms of mix that you easily you're out earning or may be seen outsized gains because of the NAND flash tighten as broadly speaking for the hard disk drive business and if so where is that in the cloud, the enterprise or other and didn't?","Steve Milligan","Repeat that again Mark, we want to make sure I understand the question, repeat that.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes, the question is I'm trying to understand because of what\u2019s growing in the NAND market right now from a capacity constrain perspective has that allowed for any sort of displacement of this drives to slowdown or maybe you've seen resurgence if you will in your hard disk drive business with cloud or enterprise or other that may be is not sustainable or maybe it is not, that may be people recognize you can guys still lot of offer goodness in hard disk drive that as well that's my first question that makes sense.","Steve Milligan","Yes, sure Mike comment on that earlier. I'll let Mike.","Mike Cordano","So give you some specific I think the tightness is, is helping in the client space so, the fact that there is tightness of supply makes more opportunity in the near-term for HDD demand to satisfy the storage requirement of a PC. Potentially in a much more modest way in the performance enterprise space we talked about that relative to our sequential growth in performance enterprise but they don't. The more pronounced factor there was actually just that the yearend budget, seasonal demand for enterprise systems. ","And on the, on the cloud side no real effect so, where we are shipping destroys as an industry that's a specific value proposition and that demand is real when ongoing so there is clear differentiation in the architecture as relative to where flash is utilized or where disk is utilize so, there is no sort of reverse displacement there.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay and then my second question is kind of an loading questions I'm going to asked in any way in terms of the cloud that the cloud buying patterns over the past few years have the time has been punctuated let them up and down or some pauses do you see this year ahead may be having less pause and actually just continue up cycle and if that is the case because of the combined model now of SanDisk and WD are you getting a more reception, get a reception from the cloud providers to do more are you getting more line to expand with those accounts and thereby can that actually continue to put upward pressure of one goodness on gross margin.","Steve Milligan","Let me answer it in the sequence the way you asked it. So I think relative to the buying behavior we've certainly always characterized this segment on a annualized basis for that reason. I think that was updated and increased our annual growth rate is an indication of our confidence now in going strength. We've talked previous conference calls around some of that reason that that's happening as their sort of fewer efficiency things happening in hyper scale whether they be operational or technological.","We believe we continue to see more raw or base demand flowing through us for HD and micro. So we would expect that, that 40% growth for the current calendar year relative to the sort of the way we engage them I think we talked about this earlier we certainly benefit from the broad portfolio of products our ability to participate across both HDD and flash-based product offerings give us the unique position to work not only short-term relative to sort of business engagement. But also long-term as we think about long-range data center architectures in the future. So we have all the components we're uniquely positioned to have that conversation and we're already benefiting from that portfolio ultimately.","Steve Milligan","All right. So that's our last question, so I want to thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.","I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award. The diversified nature of our business together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries continue to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations. In our business we saw particular strength and demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for enterprise SSDs. As anticipated there was a seasonal demand uptick for branded products. ","We expect ongoing hyper-scale cloud deployments coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model to continue fuelling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Terabyte growth in this category is expected to remain strong. Our flash platform solution business which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter delivering revenue of $187 million. The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in client, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand and capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced. I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market\u2019s response to our strategic growth initiative, which legally position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem. We've strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.","We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter, a broad line-up of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyper scale data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we've seen strong customer acceptance of our WD Purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched the 6-terabyte model in the December quarter that has been well received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide. There continues to be strong growth momentum and branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and prosumer markets.","The My Cloud software and apps had now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide. We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced Active Archive Platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density peta-scale capacities in a single rack and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. ","And as a reminder we expect revenue growth from our Flash Platforms business to outpace that of the industry. Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like to thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, a well diversified business, leading products and customer centric engagement model. Olivier?","Olivier Leonetti","Thank you Steve. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution help us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in October.","In our business, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain within our four to six week range.","Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our Flash Platforms Solutions Group. We shipped a total of 61 million hard drive at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our [LSP] [ph] was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products. ","Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5% which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.","Operating expenses totalled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and the flood insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights. Tax expense for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pre-tax income. The tax rate reflects the retroactive extension of the US federal R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. Our net income totalled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax benefit. ","Turning to the balance sheet, in the December quarter we generated $243 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totalled $97 million. As a reminder we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter. Our CapEx totalled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.","We closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.","I\u2019ll now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. Gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance excluding the amortization of intangibles.","R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles. The tax rate of approximately 7.5% and a share count of approximately $237 million.

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just two questions and a follow-up. First of all, can you talk on the pricing dynamic that you are seeing this quarter and potentially in the March quarter? One of your peers reported a couple of days ago they talked extensively about pricing concerns starting to creep up, so I'm curious what you are seeing and what you expect as it goes forward?","Steve Milligan","This is Steve. If you look at our fiscal Q2, so the quarter we just finished, and it is consistent with my commentary, we saw nothing unusual from a pricing perspective, versus our expectations. And we see nothing unusual this quarter from a pricing perspective. So, what I would say is that pricing behavior and price levels are just simply consistent with our expectations.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it, and if I could just follow up MOFCOM, you issued a press release in December talking about the letter you guys received and the rectification you're doing. Is there any update on that as you go forward? Is there a time lime that we start to think about given the fact that you had the update in December?","Steve Milligan","Yes. So let me review where we are at. We did announce recently that there were a couple of compliance issues that we had, that were resolved with MOFCOM. We were pleased to get those issues behind us. We have also indicated that given the resolution of those issues MOFCOM is now fully focused on reviewing our applications. Those issues needed to get resolved before MOFCOM began the formal evaluation of our application to have both separate listed. That is in process, and ongoing, and as I have indicated before, our relationship and dialogue with MOFCOM is consistent and constructive but at this point I can\u2019t provide any update as to timing, as to when MOFCOM will provide any sort of ruling. But we are working with them in a constructive fashion and we will continue to do so.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you, and congratulations on a nice quarter.","Steve Milligan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Thank you, good afternoon gentlemen. A couple of questions; first, can you just talk about the capacity enterprise segment and your ability to ship officially given some of the data center build-out plans as calendar 2015 unfolds? ","Steve Milligan","Sure. Yes, so we in the past quarter saw a good demand for our products, for capacity enterprise products, particularly from hyperscale customers. We expect that to continue. The last call I talked about having good visibility to the middle part of calendar 2015. That statement remains valid. Really what we are seeing is, we are seeing meaningful growth in terms of Petabyte deployments on behalf of our customers. We expect that to continue on through the balance of calendar 2015, how that translates to a unit of performance perspective is a little bit unknown at this point. It will vary depending upon the capacity point that has shipped as the industry transitions initially from a 4-terabyte drive to a 6-terabyte drive and then eventually at least for us to an 8-terabyte deployment. But, we are confident that we are going to continue to see strong terabyte growth for our business and for the industry and the capacity enterprise space.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","And you are comfortable with your component supply and ability to go and hit those demands?","Steve Milligan","Well, I mean there is a little bit of a qualification as kind of yes and no answer, Rich. Supply is tight. We are comfortable with where we\u2019re at, but it\u2019s tight. And so, we\u2019re watching that closely. And so these things, they use a lot of heads and disks, a lot of test time, and so we got to be watching that closely. But, right now, relative to our expectations, we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at. But, if we see more variability from an upside perspective, which is obviously possible we could run in the supply challenges.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay, and then I will ask you obligatory TAM questions. In the December quarter, you obviously, 141, larger than what your competitor was talking about, but not too surprising. When you look at normal seasonality, how would you look at the March quarter? What should we be expecting?","Steve Milligan","Yes. So, to reiterate what I talked about in terms of my [indiscernible] and I know that there were some analysts had different numbers out there, but the TAM for the December quarter pretty much turned out the way that we expected.","So the TAM, and again we will see what numbers Toshiba publishes, but a TAM in the 141 million unit range was very consistent with the expectations that we had going into the quarter. I would say that if you want to call it a surprise, the mix might have been a little bit better than what we saw and therefore you see a bit higher revenue for us and the resulting merging benefit associated with the. If we looked at where we think the TAM will shake out in March, I think something in that mid-130 range is kind of a reasonable assumption.","Operator","The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, your line is open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow up as well. Going back on the enterprise business, can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? When we look at the numbers and look at what some of your component suppliers have reported, it would appear that Toshiba saw a pretty healthy quarter in enterprise shipments. So can you talk about seeing Toshiba being at all a disruptor, and going after some of those high-capacity deals? And if not, whether you think that changes on a going forward basis? ","Steve Milligan","We didn't see anything unusual in that regard. If we look at what happened in terms of higher enterprise shipments, and I am sort of using rough numbers here, I think our units increased on a quarter-on-quarter basis about 300,000 units; and a bit of that was capacity enterprise, a bit of that was performance enterprise. If you recall one of the things that we were focused on from a performance enterprise perspective was to continue to broaden our product portfolio so that we had full coverage from a market perspective.","We began shipping our 15K small form factor drive, which allowed us to pick up some incremental business in the performance enterprise space. And with our strong portfolio and position in the capacity enterprise business, we were able to increase our business a bit there. We believe, although we will have to see how the final numbers shake out, that we maybe gain a little bit of share in that space. And so we are obviously pleased with that. From a customer, call it, satisfaction perspective, but we did not see anything from a competitive dynamic perspective in that space, that was unusual or shall we say alarming from our perspective.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe a higher level question, but when you think about your capital structure and kind of the return of cash going forward, your closest competitor raised a very impressive 20-year note in this latest quarter. How are you thinking about your return of capital and cash, and in particular how you think about the dividend trajectory on a going-forward basis, obviously in the context of the US held cash?","Olivier Leonetti","So, let me take this question. So, we are always evaluating the way we deploy our capital and we believe that the current allocation is probably be a good balance between short-term management and prudent long-term investment in the business. And at this stage we have no particular plan to change the current capital allocation, but again are under evaluation all the time. To answer to your question, specifically about US cash, and how that is a constraint. We have a fair amount of liquidity in the US through our cash balances, $1.4 billion at this stage, but also debt capacity which is quite high as well, our leverage ratio is in the range of 4.7, as you know. So we can sustain our current allocation for at least four years or more.","Steve Milligan","So one thing just to add to that is that -- the key thing is that we\u2019re focused on longer term value creation and making sure that we have a capital structure that enables us to do that. And obviously the dynamics that influence that, our needs for cash, uses of cash, all of that, but it\u2019s centred fundamentally on what do we need to do as a business to make sure that we are creating a long-term value for ourselves and our shareholders going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal, your line is open.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. I had two as well. Steve, I want to start with you. You indicated that pricing was consistent with your view. I wonder if you could flush that out a little more. What were like-for-like pricing either in December quarter, and\/or what are you expecting in the March quarter? And against that trajectory, are the newer liner enterprise performance drives deviating from the overall pattern associated with the rest of your product portfolio?","Steve Milligan","As an overall segment we had been saying, I recall that, low single-digit price decline, like-for-like. And really that\u2019s still holding more or less a quite confident or consistent on a relative basis over the last few quarters. And so frankly we just did not see anything -- let me qualify. There is always pockets -- this is a competitive business. There is always pockets of where pricing in this segment might be doing something a little bit unusual here and there. But, we did not see anything unusual from a pricing perspective, either quarter, or we are seeing anything unusual in terms of the March quarter.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, but within that, just if you could [flash out] [ph], is near line \u2013 does that also embrace the near line product portfolio, that you're not seeing anything outside of that kind of low single-digit sequential difference?","Olivier Leonetti","Well, near line is a little bit different in the sense that...but this again is not a change. I mean the first thing is, is that there is a fair amount of margin on those products...","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Right.","Olivier Leonetti","We're also introducing higher capacity points in those products preceded by a 4-terabyte, you're going to see the clients for those capacity [points] [ph] that exceed the overall average, but that\u2019s not anything unusual. When it gets introduced, it may be in limited supply as the supply begins to increase and you see greater customer acceptance of that. And as we come down the cost curve, the price declines and tend to be steeper. But that is nothing at all unusual.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then Steve, this is my follow-up question, if you wanted to provide your views, if the TAM comes out to a mid-130s, as you said, for the March quarter, how are you thinking about the TAM as you look out, particularly with related to PC clients? I'm sure you're aware of a lot of consternation, especially what the PC market can deliver this year. I wanted to see if you could just provide some high-level views as you look out over the next couple quarters on the VHED TAM and\/or that PC client TAM? And that's it for me, thanks.","Steve Milligan","Sure. We would expect at present and of course our expectations can change that the March quarter will be the [low points] [ph] for the year. So at this point for the June quarter, we think that we could see either a flat or maybe slightly up TAM in the June quarter; more obviously update our expectations for that as we move through the quarter. And then obviously as we move through the back half of the calendar year where we get help from the seasonality perspective, we would expect to see the TAM increase from there.","Operator","The next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies LLC, your line is open.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I'm guess this is going to press more on the PC market, or the client market. Your competitor ventured a guess, but the overall growth rate might be for the year for client units, I think they said low single digits. Would you agree with that? Do you have any view? ","Steve Milligan","We have consistently indicated that we expect that PC sales will -- well let me backup, what\u2019s still happening is that we have been saying low single digit decline on a year-on-year basis in the PC space. That went consistent with our expectation and we would expect that going forward that we will continue to see that. As that relates to hard drive shipments into the PC segment we also have to contemplate the fact that more and more client units are using solid state devices versus rotating magnetic storage and so we will see more of a drag than that low single digit in terms of hard drive shift into the PC market. And so that\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying for the last several quarters and very consistent with our expectations.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","And a quick follow up, could you update us on the uptake of the Helium? Did it contribute at all to ASPs, or is it not material factor there? Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Yeah. Relative to the helium, let me broaden that a little bit, clearly part of the reason that we saw an uptick in terms of our ASPs and also our margins were due to the strength in our capacity enterprise business of which helium is a part of that. Helium as an individual category, particularly as it relates to 6-terabyte drive probably did not have a material impact. We believe that as we transition to the 8- terabyte platform with the helium product, we will begin to see a bit of a larger impact.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","Hi, thank you, I was hoping to get a little more detail on your surveillance market. You called it out as being strong this quarter. Can you give us a little more detail on the magnitude of that market and where it is represented in your unit numbers?","Steve Milligan","Yes. Well is it in the consumer electronics number? So, our CE line on our data sheet is where the surveillance drives are contained, Sherri and it\u2019s a market that we expect will grow in low single-digit growth rate and so some expanding area on an obviously now you are seeing in some of the news, and the impact of that. And so it\u2019s a good market for us and it also carried a gross margin profile that is above the overall corporate average.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","Okay great. And then, just thinking about the enterprise SSD market, that business looks like it was up 20% for you year-over-year. What types of growth expectations do you have for that segment going forward? Thanks.","Steve Milligan","Yes. We had a very large order at Q2 last year. If you look at the sequential, it is pretty strong and we have indicated that would expect to grow faster than the market and the market is expected to grow at about 40% and we\u2019re staying behind that trajectory. ","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","How are you thinking about any risk of cloud vendors either catching up with demand or getting through their investment cycle, and some more lumpiness as we go into the back half? Is there any visibility or high-level thoughts on whether we could see lumpiness further out in that market? And then I have a follow up. ","Steve Milligan","Yes, Katy, that's something that we keep a close eye on the -- we are seeing, as I indicated strong growth from a Petabyte prespective, when we talk to our customer, and they talk about what\u2019s happening from what they are seeing they expect the Petabyte growth to continue. But at times they can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of the order flow and we saw that last year. So we felt pretty comfortable with where we are at right now, but it is something that we monitor pretty closely. But we are confident that overall data growth will continue to be very strong. It\u2019s just a matter of how the storage get deployed against that where sometimes the lumpiness can potentially come in.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then Seagate is talking about turning over their entire product portfolio this calendar year. Is that something that impacts your OpEx, and if not, do you view yourself at any advantage or disadvantages as they go through that cycle? ","Steve Milligan","We are not expecting there to be any abnormal increase, I guess I would say, in terms of our operating expense as it relates to product deployments. And we are continuing to invest in some of these new growth initiatives, but that's different and refreshing our base hard drive products. So, we would not expect that we would see, call it a surge in our operating expenses as it relates to that and we continue to expect that we are going to have a competitive product line-up to matchup against our competitors.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Yoo at Citi Research. Your line is open.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup","Thank you, Steve and I apologize that I'm asking another pricing question, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the weakness of the Yen and its potential impact to hard drive pricing? And did it have any impact to your pricing strategy, or do you think that maybe it affected Toshiba's behavior?","Steve Milligan","That would be speculative. I don\u2019t know. And so if the question that ultimately would need to be directed to Toshiba to get a more specific question, I would reiterate really one thing and that relative to what we saw from the competitive dynamic perspective. We didn't really see anything that was particularly out of the ordinary. The other thing I would add, which is just kind of anecdotal comment. I was at Hitachi as a CEO there and Yen movement did not impact at all. anything that we did. But, I don't know how it impacts Toshiba. ","Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you. And my follow-up is on the flash platform solution, can you provide some tangible factors that give you the confidence that you can grow above the market?","Steve Milligan","Well, let me take the most tangible factor as we have been growing faster than the market. So I think that history is probably the thing that gives the most tangible proof of that. The other thing is that we have a product roadmap that we\u2019re focused on, that has been discussed and shared with our customers. We are sampling some new products with our customers. We\u2019re getting positive feedback and so as we go through the development process and when we go through prequalification process with our customers, our confidence in our ability to grow faster than the market just continues to be solid.","Operator","The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital, your line is open.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital, LLC","Congratulations on a solid quarter. Two if I could. Steve, I would love to get your view on the need for the industry margin structure to continue to rise, as we talked about the cloud demand and hyperscale picks up and the negative supply environment there begins to tighten up, through the impact that can have on your ability to ship the overall TAM? I would love to get your thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up as well, thanks.","Steve Milligan","Let me take that question in a different direction, rather than me speculating on where the industry margins go. Let me talk about the things that are impacting our business. What\u2019s fundamentally happening from our standpoint is the secular forces, if you want to refer to it that way are basically -- what\u2019s increasing is those elements of our business, they carry higher margins. So we have a tailwind, in effect, that is pushing us to higher-margin opportunities. Also, the things that we\u2019re investing in the strategic growth initiatives, generally speaking carry higher margins. Right now, 58% of our business is \u201cnon-PC\u201d. And we know and we said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there is less ability to differentiate and accordingly those products carry lower margin profiles. But, as our revenue increases in the non-PC segment generally carrying higher margins, we have a bias over time for gross margins increasing as opposed to decreasing over time. That being said, we continue to have a stated gross margin range of 27 and 32. But, as these things continue to evolve, we\u2019ll look at whether or not we need to re-evaluate on that gross margin range.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC","Got it, that is really helpful. I appreciate it. And just as my follow up quickly, do you believe that the TAM has a chance to grow in 2015 over 2014?","Steve Milligan","We believe that we\u2019ll see low single-digit growth from an overall TAM perspective.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC","Got it, thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thanks, good afternoon. Steve, just going back over the pricing one more time. I understand what you are talking about, just typical pricing patterns, especially as you go up to a higher capacity. It seems like your competitor is saying that the typical pricing should not apply, because of the rising complexities and the tighter components, and just the overall cost of capacity. Can you just react to that statement as to whether there is the potential for the industry to change in terms of how it looks at pricing as you go from 4 to 6 to 8 terabyte products?","Steve Milligan","Well it is kind of difficult for me to comment on that specifically. I mean the bottom-line to it is that I am going to repeat two things and that pricing was consistent with our expectation and at the end of the day and order for us to be able to do what we need to do, we have to have pricing that is competitive with the industry. Whatever that means in terms of you know what price declines, whatever it means but at the end of the day we did not see anything particularly unusual and remember that margins in that business carry higher margins. So I mean we are comfortable in general with where we are position in that regard.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Fair enough, it was worth a shot. And then just as a quick follow up, your average capacity was up 24% year-over-year. Obviously some of that, or a lot of that was driven by the enterprise capacity drivers. But can you sort of dissect that a little bit further and talk about how average capacity looks year over year in some of the other products. Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti","I mean we could obviously as Steve indicated we saw big increase year-over-year and exhibiting the capacity enterprise. If I look at the rest of the business, performance enterprise going low single digits and the rest of much pretty much stable year on year.","Steve Milligan","So I was kind of trying back to the point that was I making earlier as more and more of our business is deployed against non-PC applications, generally speaking those were higher mixed products where they would be branders, whether it would be surveillance, it would on the enterprise space and so as on mix transitions from an overall business prospective we are going to get a nice bump in terms of the average capacity point shift.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next questions from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi, thanks. Steve, you acknowledge hard drives will lose share within the PC category, and we are going to see that accelerate exiting the year. So, I am kind of assuming your expectations of low single digit decline for PCs, is the current trajectory in your client units which is down 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis, is that a good guesstimate or barometer going forward of what the trajectory will be? Thanks.","Steve Milligan","We anticipate again we will see what Toshiba publishes that we lost a little bit of share in the Notebook space and that was primarily because which of what kind have happened over the last couple of quarters, some of that may have a little bit to do with gaming, and then also that is where margins tend to be lower and so that may be some of the area where we just chose to not participate in some of the business.","So I would say that decline is steeper that what the industry is seeing.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Helpful, thanks.","Operator","The last question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc","Great, thanks for taking me in. Steve, a question on the archive market. You have launched product that seems to be built specifically for that opportunity. Could you talk a little bit about traction there, and what the potential is longer-term?","Steve Milligan","As I indicated in my remarks, we have got some, I hate to call sample units but we have got some customer applications running and test unit and that kind of thing and response so far. Our customers are very pleased that we actually now have to construct a subsystem for them, given that we have been a component supplier for so long and so we are encouraged and I think it\u2019s fair to say that our customers are encouraged as well. It is some of the progress that we are making in that area.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc","When you say you will be moving up the enterprise stack, is this an example of that and will some of that be more obvious down the road, or is it mostly going to be things that happen behind the scenes?","Steve Milligan","Yes, this is an example of that. We are going to have to see all of that evolves. We will look at opportunity to intelligently move up the enterprise stack and will do our best to do that which we have done so far in a collaborative fashion with our customers. Our goal is not to compete with our customers but they figure out of that way of enabling them, so that they can extent their value proposition to their customers whether that be through other software services, other kind of offerings. So that is our base strategy is.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Okay, great.

Welcome to Western Digital's Financial Results for the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal","Thank you. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management's current expectations, and include known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors many of which Western Digital is unable to predict or control that may cause Western Digital's actual results, performance or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","This call does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in connection with the pending acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital filed the Form S-4 registration statement with the SEC which was declared effective by the SEC on February 5, 2016 and Western Digital filed the definitive proxy statement\/prospectus on February 5, 2016, which was mailed to Western Digital and SanDisk stockholders on or about that day.","Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement\/prospectus carefully, because it contains important information about the acquisition.

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries.","I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track, having received shareholder approval in March, and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition, the last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition.","Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the standalone guidance we're providing today, to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter.","Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter, given continued softer PC demand and weaker than expected demand in performance enterprise.","We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter, by continuing to take costs out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix.","We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices, storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures.","It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they are carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions anticipates these and other trends.","After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and non-volatile memory.","Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter. Olivier?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million.","Non-GAAP tax (6:43) expense for the March quarter was $26 million, or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $283 million or $1.21 per share. In the March quarter, we generated $485 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $352 million. Our CapEx totaled $133 million or 5% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S.","I will now provide an update on cost savings initiatives as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly factsheet posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimates of the savings on our last earnings conference call in late January.","Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017 versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which two-third will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017.","This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50\/50 split between the two years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017.","For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017 with a 50\/50 split between the two years. As a reminder, these savings would provide us with the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%.","We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these sayings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.","Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter, operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's standalone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial period of ownership of SanDisk in the June quarter.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Olivier. I wanted to clarify on your OpEx savings. I think you said OpEx would now be at a run rate of $460 million. Is that what you said going forward after these savings from MOFCOM? And then, just thinking about the savings, where are these coming from? Why do you think you're able to get so much more savings from the synergies between Western Digital and Hitachi? Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the saving to be achieved after two years will reach an amount of $450 million. That's an annual number. To help you in your modeling, we will expect, as a result, at the end of calendar year 2016 quarterly OpEx of being $495 million and at the end of 2017, an amount in Q4 of $460 million.","Those savings come from a range of activities ranging from rationalization in R&D, in G&A mainly for OpEx.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sherri, we're basically eliminating redundancies where we've got redundant functions between the two entities. And also just why has the number changed? Obviously, when a large part of the hold separate was lifted, we had estimates of what those savings would look like. And as we progress through the integration process, we're able to refine those estimates and have more specific numbers to provide not only for ourselves, but for the investment community.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just clarifying on the debt, when do you close the debt to buy SanDisk and how should we think about that as an interest rate, because it looks like it's impacting EPS a little bit more than I would have thought? So it seems like you'll close that before the deal happens. Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So all the financing is complete. So the $18.1 billion we needed to raise has been raised and it's either committed by banks or sold to investors. So we expect to come back to you with all the details associated with the interest and time of reimbursement and so on, as we close the transaction which will be, as we said, during Steve prepared remarks in the June quarter.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And Sherri, just to clarify, the EPS estimate that we provided does not include the impact of interest expense associated with the acquisition.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So when we give updated financial views, we didn't want to do, I'll call it a half a loaf, right? So when we closed the transaction or shortly thereafter, we will provide an updated view for the sub period for our fiscal Q4, which will include the impact of SanDisk's business on us, any purchase accounting impacts and interest expense. So it will be a full-on view for calendar Q2.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One additional comment on the debt, obviously, the cost of the debt for secured bond and unsecured bond is public. But we wanted to say that the average rate for the total debt will be significantly lower than the rate of the bonds and will come back to you in short order.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. That clarifies.

Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions.

Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'll comment on it, and then, Mike Cordano may want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called 100 million unit TAM and came in at whatever, 99.8, that's our estimate, right? We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet.","And within that, I would say that the PC market, obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now, that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit, because we've been pretty bearish on the PC market for a while. But clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected.","I would say that from a demand perspective, the area of, if you want to call it, biggest surprise was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike can comment a little bit on what we're seeing there, after I kind of give a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then, there were some other areas that were maybe kind of slightly better than what we expected where, in aggregate, it came out to kind of 100 million unit TAM number.","Now, from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go forward estimates as it relates to our financials.","On the negative side is that we saw steeper than anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and, even more specifically, in capacity enterprise. And to be even more specific on that, in the 4 terabyte, 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins where they were short of our expectations, and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And oh, by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more steeper declines from a pricing perspective.","Now, what we're doing as a consequence of that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint, because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selective price increases in certain enterprise markets. And at this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do.","And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Hi, Rich. So I think it's important to start delineating the performance enterprise marketplace. And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is a decline in 15,000 RPM that continues \u2013 that trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10,000 RPM market quarter-over-quarter.","But the pronounced reduction we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all-flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trends, downward trends within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment and we'll be, as Steve said, looking at the way that portfolio shapes up and positioning ourselves appropriately.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, Olivier, I know it's early, but in light of recent actions by the Treasury Department on, initially I guess tax inversions, but it could potentially have broader impacts on broad cross-border transfers and other things. Do you see any impact at this point on the way you wanted to normalize the tax rate between the two companies over time?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Rich, obviously this recent action is a draft which is currently being open for comments. And while it's premature for us to provide more details at this stage, we feel comfortable with the structure of our transactions. So no change at this stage, Rich.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. A couple questions also, if I can. First of all, as we look at the capacity shipment growth for the industry, it's continued to be relatively slow. I was curious if you could help us understand or delineate between what you've seen capacity shipment growth-wise in the PC market as well as CE. And then, relative to the overall enterprise market. And then in the context of the pricing environment, I'm curious of how you would frame the discussion around the gross margin differential between those segments.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Let me touch on that capacity growth. So we continue to see, again, looking on an annualized basis, considering the calendar year, capacity enterprise continues to trend at this 35% run rate. Last year looks like, and the data is preliminary, that it came in around 34%. We would expect this year also to be tracking to that number, maybe slightly greater. We'll see how the year pans out.","Now, the one thing I should point out, we discussed this last time, is carrier 2015 was inverted relative to seasonality, stronger in the first half, weaker in the second half. This year is more traditional seasonality where we expect strength in the back end of the year. And that's further supported by what a number of the hyperscale companies have talked about relative to expected CapEx. So that growth remains as expected. The softness in capacity shipments really is across the other markets, led by the PC market as well as this new news that we discussed today on performance enterprise.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Any comments on the relative margin differential between the segments?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Aaron, I'm not sure there's any new commentary. Obviously, the higher margin segments for us is in the enterprise area, capacity enterprise and performance. And then all still at attractive margins, the low end of that would be client-related activity as well as in gaming. And so there's really no change in terms of our margin hierarchy that we've talked about previously.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. If you could just start with for the June quarter, you guys I think are looking at the TAM or at least revenues decline by about 6%. Is that entirely going to come from units or is there a pricing dynamic as well? And any segment information you could provide in terms of what's getting incrementally softer in June would be helpful.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so we would say that TAM, to be more specific, would be about 95 million units for the June quarter. And the primary reason for that is continued weakness in terms of the PC market. And not only that, but, frankly, from our standpoint and as well as our customers, a very cautious view with regards to that market. Not a lot of bullish views out there on the PC market. As well as continued softness in terms of the performance enterprise.","Those are the only ones that I think are really kind of worthy of calling out. We've got some other puts and takes in terms of normal seasonal trends that we see from a Q1 to Q2. But the primary reason for that decline is really those two factors that I called out.","The other thing that I would add to that is that if you go back to our prior conference call, we had anticipated that the March quarter would be the low point of the year from a TAM perspective. Obviously, that has not borne itself out assuming that the TAM turns out to be 95 million units. And the primary reason for that is, again, because of weaker PC sales and softer demand for traditional performance enterprise hard drives.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And if I just follow-up on the enterprise SSD side, revenues were down I think 11% versus year-over-year. And you guys talked about it being down last quarter somewhat, but it seems a little bit more severe than I would have thought and what some of your peers have been talking about. So I'm just wondering if you could just talk about what's happening within that segment and how do you see that transpire for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think we had talked about a product transition underway. Certainly, we are seeing increased competitiveness there. But for us, we're in the midst of a product transition, which we will get through as we progress through the year. So that largely accounts for the difference you're talking about.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and by the way, just to give you some insight to that. We had obviously expected and we messaged and telegraphed a decrease in terms of that revenue. And the decrease was more or less consistent with what we expected. And not only that, we we did a little bit better than we thought. So it's not concerning for us. It's something that we expected. And it just has to do with the normal product transition that we're working through on our end with our customers.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Right. And I'll add a little more color. I think relative to strategic engagements, they remain very well intact. And we think we'll get through this in the normal course of things. So no ongoing impact that we expect once we get through the transition.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, Steve, it seems like the characterization of your customer and trend and their buying behavior is changing. The traditional enterprises haven't been as active over the past few years and that has been replaced by the cloud guys, and the cloud guys are pushing for more of a array procurement. In that context, do you see the change in your customer characterization having an impact on how you define different segments of the market?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So I think we absolutely see a transition between our customers, but that's really reflected mostly by moving from platform to traditional client server markets to cloud-based architectures as we talked about in our prepared remarks. So that architectural shift is happening, and with that, the ratio of business is trending towards more of the cloud-based architectures when we talk about enterprise.","So as we look at the customers, certainly, is that the relative revenue is changing the way we look at them, engage them is also changing and that's all contemplated within our business and our modeling going forward. So yes, to your question, both from a customer transition as well as a \u2013 which architectures are we shipping into and how workloads are migrating.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Which makes it lumpier. And a follow-up has to do with the NAND. Have you already started the product qualification as you go through the integration of SanDisk? And how should we think about the timing associated, because as you go through the qualification for your own \u2013 for the existing SSD products, as well as consolidating enterprise SSDs once SanDisk is integrated, I imagine there would be a time or a lagging effect how you get your arms around it. Is that going to \u2013 do we need to wait till July conference call to get more clarification or how should we think about this timing? Any color you can provide will be appreciated.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, a few comments there. I mean the first thing is, no, we have not begun any qualification or integration-related activities for our products. And I think it's important to note that, obviously, we continue to operate as two separate companies. And so that would be inappropriate for us to be engaging in that kind of activity at this point.","Now, relative to the timing, let me make a few comments on that. From a financial perspective, when we talked about the financial synergies that we expected to realize, there was some timing that was wrapped around that. There is no change in terms of the expectation as it relates to that timing. So that remains consistent.","Obviously, we'll update the investment community as we move forward on how that timing may change, et cetera. But there are multiple considerations that we have to think about. Obviously, the most important thing is that we want to execute the transition in a way that makes the most sense for our partners. And so, that's our customers, as well as our relationship with Intel. We've enjoyed a very strong relationship with Intel over a period of time. And we want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that makes the most sense for all the parties involved. So that will take some time, and we do believe that when we talked about the financial synergies that we would realize that we factored in appropriately those time considerations in our thinking.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. I know the acquisition is not closed yet, the SanDisk acquisition, but how are you viewing the relative progress of the 3D NAND roadmap at SanDisk, especially in the context of other industry investments? And what timeframe do you expect the SanDisk acquisition to be accretive given the moving pieces? And I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so I'm going to speak to it in general, because we don't have perfect visibility into that, but we continued to be encouraged. I mean, obviously, we did extensive due diligence just to kind of back up on where we believe that SanDisk was at from a 3D NAND transition perspective. And we have monitored their progress, as time has gone on, and as you saw in their earnings release, they continue to make good progress.","So we're actually very pleased with where they are at on their 3D NAND transition. We're not in a position to be updating our financial view on the transaction. I mean the numbers that we put out there remain intact. And obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. There are a lot of variables that can change, but in general, we continue to believe that the financial assumptions that we have looked at remain solid as it relates to the acquisition of SanDisk.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the potential to raise prices more broadly across the portfolio? And what impact on the flip side do you think that raising prices could have on the rate of SSD adoption? Did you see some of that already?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean the ability to raise prices, that's always a difficult question to answer. I mean what we're trying to do is we're trying to provide value to our customers. And there's a lot of different ways you can provide value to the customers. And we have to have price competitive products, but we also need to make sure that we've got sufficient returns on those products that we're selling that allows us to reinvest in our technology and our products such that those products continue to remain compelling.","And so, as we indicated, we have taken some efforts and seen price increases stick in the 2.5-inch market. We saw steeper declines in the enterprise market. We chose not to participate in some of those areas. We're now in the process of instituting some selective price increases in the enterprise market. And it's too early to tell at this point to what extent they're going to stick. And so, we'll have to see, because there are other market participants and we're just trying to run on our own plays and see how it all works out.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to build off of the last question in terms of just trying to understand what have been your assumptions around the kind of the vector, if you will, in terms of HDD versus SSD penetration in terms of how much of PCs, server and storage capacity currently is served by HDD versus SSD, and where does that kind of trend over the next two years, three years, that give you confidence to be, one, pursuing SanDisk, but also, two, to becoming this agnostic media provider.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, I'll have Mike take a stab at that.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","You need to think about it differently for each segment. In the case of PC, it's a unit replacement. So you think about a PC, it has \u2013 most often, it has a single storage device, and there's going to be a selection made between a HDD or an SSD.","So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time. In the SSD versus PC outlook, we're in the mid-30%s in terms of penetration. That's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe the trend will continue.","Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload and it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per I\/O basis. Flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise. It's primarily in two spots. One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage systems area. And that's where you can get a more efficient cost per I\/O across total infrastructure, system infrastructure.","So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric. It's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I\/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus. It's not a one-for-one replacement either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area.","Moving into servers. It follows something closer to the PC model, where you have low-end and mid-range servers that tend to have a number of storage devices and it tends to be price-point related. So you match the CPU, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going and, frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see the impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and I think, Mark, just to add to that, it's a little bit of a financial overlay to it. The trends that we're seeing are consistent with our expectations. And I think that's an important thing.","But as you know, sometimes the difficult thing is not so much to predict what the trend is going to be, but the rate and pace. And so the rate and pace is kind of difficult to estimate. But what's important relative to what we're doing and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as with the acquisition of SanDisk, is that you have the optionality or the ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issues that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to in legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker.","And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate not only those trends, but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to deal with those changes.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, and one last comment just to append what Steve said. So although the pieces underneath are moving around on us, as we've described, the aggregate spend in enterprise on storage when you combine SSD and HDD continues to grow at a rate that's consistent with our expectation.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. It sounds like it's a pretty frenetic environment, but it sounds like at this point you will be in a position to optimize the combined company and not have to be playing catch-up relative to some of these dynamics.","I guess I have just one follow-up though, if I could. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the cloud providers versus the on-premise? Are they acting a little differently with respect to flash versus disk?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. So, the cloud guys have been on a capacity enterprise plus flash model for some time. They have not been a big consumer of performance enterprise. That really goes to our legacy systems businesses. So that trend continues within the cloud world.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","I just want to clarify your comments on MOFCOM. So there was a news source that was reporting that the NDRC is getting involved and that in the MOFCOM approval process, seen some complaints from suppliers around this deal. And just wondering if you can comment whether there have been complaints and has that slowed the approval process at all and when do you think you might get approval?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, so just as I said, we have a very strong relationship with MOFCOM. We have a very constructive dialogue with them. I'm not going to comment and chase rumors around, but I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making and we expect to close the transaction here in the second quarter. So no issues from that perspective.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up. This quarter, I think you spent less on CapEx in absolute terms than you have in a very long time. And just wondering how we should think about the capital intensity of Western Digital's business sort of ex-SanDisk going forward over the next few quarters as well as the next couple of years. Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, as we are rationalizing the footprint of our organization that will have an impact on CapEx, obviously, we're looking at maximizing the use of cash. To answer specifically to your question, 4% of revenue going forward is probably \u2013 CapEx is probably a good number to use.","James Kisner - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just two, if I could. The first one, Steve, is just to sort of follow on your comments about rate and pace. How do you guys philosophically think about the interplay in the enterprise between what's going on with flash and then the traditional enterprise portfolio?","And I know you can't comment sort of probably specifically about the SanDisk product, but just from what attracted you in that regard to their portfolio, just a bigger picture, do you \u2013 if you see the shift may be taking place a little bit more quickly, the enterprise to flash from \u2013 sort of from performance HDD.","Do you think that there can be a relatively, I guess, smooth transition from a revenue dollar perspective relative to the WD P&L? It seems like it was a \u2013 I think you're implying is a little bit more disruptive this quarter than you thought it might have been. So we'd love to get your thoughts on at least the high or low, how we might think about that interplay as we go forward. And then I had just one quick follow-up. Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, let me try to answer that. So I think relative to a post- acquisition close situation, we will be able to participate in all segments of the enterprise SSD marketplace. So once we've accomplished that, the comment I made earlier relative to the growth within enterprise devices, SSD plus HDD being largely as expected, is really the movement within. So we really need the broad portfolio to do that. We are obviously excited to get to the point where we have in that. So we think we have the diverse tools we need to manage that transition.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we were \u2013 by the way, I mean we were very pleased with the enterprise SSD numbers that SanDisk posted yesterday. So that's encouraging as well.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","That's very helpful context. And then, just quickly, Steve, what are your TAM views for the remainder of the year given that kind of June Q feels a little bit softer than you thought it would be 90 days ago. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, in that, it's difficult to predict at this point to be honest, because it is \u2013 we got a weak macroeconomic environment. So I don't need to go through all of the reasons why demand is a little bit more suppressed than what we'd hoped. But what we expect to see is a normal seasonal bump in terms of demand in Q3 and Q4. The question is how much. And frankly, I'm going to have to kind of skirt that question, because I think that it's still a little bit too far out to be able to predict that, but we would expect to see some sort of seasonal increase in demand in calendar Q3 and Q4.","To where we should have a TAM? This is not going to really help you, but we clearly should have a TAM that will be in excess of 400 million units, right?","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. A real quick question on the gross margin. I mean, I know we've been looking at this a long time. Do you think you're running at a new normal? I know you guided to the top half of your range, but what gives you confidence that the gross margin won't stay down in the lower half given what we see in the last few quarters?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's two factors to consider. One is that we have these cost savings that will be realizing as a consequence of the WD HGST integration, which will obviously assist us in improving our gross margins. The other thing is, which Mike talked about is, over the last really three quarters, ourselves and as an industry have been dealing with a bit of a suppressed demand environment in the capacity enterprise market.","And so, as that works its way back up to a more normalized demand environment, say, starting in the second half of this year which is back on that 35% kind of exabyte consumption model, that will aid us from a gross margin perspective. And then, additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we have taken some actions to selectively increase our prices which we also believe, assuming that they stick, will provide a benefit to our gross margins.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Could you characterize the Hitachi stuff, what's going to \u2013 what do you feel like \u2013 is that most of it or is that half of it or a third? I don't know.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would prefer not to try to dimension it that way. I think you're just going to have to do your own modeling to try to estimate that.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. The pressure on performance enterprise seems real versus AFA as discussed on the call. Are we getting close to a point where, in your enterprise segment, you're shipping more capacity enterprise than performance enterprise?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that we have talked about that, Jayson. So you're going to have to \u2013 I feel like a broken record. You're going to have to do your best to try to guesstimate that on your own.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. Just a follow-up on visibility into capacity enterprise. Your language is the same or similar, at least, to last quarter on strength in the second half. Has visibility improved from that segment over the last few months? And is it \u2013 it's more of a second half of the calendar year than it is a June quarter event?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So I think we talked earlier that it was going to be a stronger second half of the calendar year last time. I would say our resolution continues to tighten as we get closer, so we have basically confirmation of what we thought last time. So that's been largely echoed in what we hear relative to CapEx plans from some large consumers of these units.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section sometime later after this call.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, Chief Executive Officer.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM had placed on our business.","We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million, and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected.","We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long-term.","We're taking a number of important steps in this context. We're reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products, and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail in the magnitude and timing of the integration related savings, but let me cite a few examples.","Last week, we announced the closure of our head wafer manufacturing facility in Otawara, Japan, one of our three head wafer facilities. We are streamlining our product roadmap by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of six programs. And we recently set our new leadership team with a plan to complete our new company-wide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry.","Turning to the longer term, we remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing, and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the innovated growth and the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored, and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders.","We continue to diversify our revenue base into higher growth areas aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in capacity enterprise, most recently with our leadership in Helium seal drives. Our Helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10 terabyte drive, our third generation Helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of Helium technology and enterprise IT, as it marks a shift for hard drive makers to deliver value-added storage solutions to customers, based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership.","Our enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending, and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive Systems business, with several wins in tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications, and other vertical markets.","Regarding the SanDisk acquisition, we are pleased with the progress we're making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible. And as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have completed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro-competitive. We've also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter.","I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across non-volatile memory and rotating magnetic media, and an expanded addressable market.","On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with CFIUS, as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. CFIUS has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given CFIUS's heavy case load towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and re-file our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. CFIUS agreed to our request and we re-filed in January. We now expect a decision from CFIUS sometime in February.","Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV. I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees.","Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.3 billion. We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5%, and operating expenses totaled $542 million.","Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million, or 5% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million, or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million, or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S.","I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. Finally, we indicated the savings will be attained over a one-year to two years period. There are three main components in realizing these savings, including asset and footprint reduction, product roadmap consolidation and organization rationalization.","During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million, from which these cost savings should be calculated. Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017.","For cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017. This would give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016, and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash costs to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction efforts. Finally, we expect about 75% of these costs to be incurred in 2016, and the balance in 2017.","Moving onto our guidance for the March quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter, operating expenses of approximately $500 million. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, before we get to questions, I just wanted to correct, I had a misreading of my script. The strategic joint venture with Unisplendour will sell our storage systems in China. I believe I misread that as Japan. So I just want to clarify that.","We'll take people's questions now. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question here comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line's now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, and appreciate the detail, Steve and Olivier, on the cost-cutting. I wanted to ask, on the timing, 50% in 2016 and 50% in 2017, how does that roll out through the year, Olivier?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It will be equally stepping up. I think it's fair to expect that by the end of calendar year 2016. OpEx should be around $520 million, and at the end of calendar year 2017, about $470 million.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then a follow-up on exabytes shipped. Some softness at the end of the year. Do you have much visibility? And what should we expect for the year from a seasonality perspective? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take that question. So I think relative to exabytes shipped, particularly in capacity enterprise, we did see it come in a little bit beneath our estimate of 35% growth year-on-year, came in around 32%. We would expect we would normalize back towards 35% this year. We do have some visibility in terms of capital investments of our large customers. We'd expect the seasonality to move back towards something more typical where we would see something in the range of 55% to 60% in the second half of the calendar year, the balance in the first half.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. The line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I think everybody wants to hear what you have to say about \u2013 in case the Unis deal doesn't happen. In other words, if CFIUS approval is not obtained by the end of February, then the SanDisk acquisition requires the Western Digital shareholder approval and given the fact you seem comfortable that SanDisk is going to close in the June quarter, what gives you confidence that your shareholders are going to approve this?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So there's kind of several questions in there. Let me clarify a couple of things. The first thing is that the closing of the SanDisk acquisition is not contingent upon the closing of the Unis transaction. What will be affected, if for one reason or another, the Unis transaction were not to close, would be that incremental shares would be issued to the SanDisk shareholders in that sort of a scenario. Under either event, we will be seeking shareholder vote on the transaction and the only question is will the number of shares exceed 20% of our outstanding shares. And so there is a scenario where we would seek a shareholder vote, but it may not require the issuance of 20% of our shareholders. But either way, we will be conducting a proxy solicitation on behalf of our shareholders.","Regarding our confidence level in terms of shareholder \u2013 our strong belief is and very strong belief and strong conviction is that this is the appropriate move for us to make for long-term shareholder value creation and we're confident in our ability to be able to get the necessary approvals from our shareholders to proceed with the transaction.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Your December quarter had enterprise SSD revenue of $270 million, up 44% year-over-year. How should we think about that trending into calendar year 2016?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So I think we noted in our comments there'll be some dynamics happening in the first part of the year where we'd expect a pause in that growth. And that's due to two factors. One is, would be typical IT spending being on a more cyclical basis or a seasonal basis. And we do see additional competition in that space, which we would expect to have a effect on our trajectory.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That being said, one of the things that we've said consistently is that we believe with our product portfolio and execution, we have the opportunity to continue to grow our enterprise SSD revenue at a multiple of the market growth, and we continue to believe that that will be the case moving forward.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Would you elaborate on the market growth?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I believe \u2013 what's the longer-term CAGR been estimated at?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have been assuming about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, and that's a revenue statement.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Which segments are driving the below seasonal decline in the TAM in March? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So it's primarily PC and gaming being the biggest impact to that effect.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then you mentioned some visibility in the CapEx plans of large customers. I imagine you're commenting about cloud. Facebook gave aggressive guidance last night, so that makes sense. Would you expect WD's outside share of those large purchases among the cloud service providers to remain? And do you even think that you could grow your share of those purchases this year?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We think our value proposition to these customers with our product portfolio as well as the services we wrap around them allow us to maintain our share position over time. Obviously, we have continued to execute well as we move forward, as we ramp to 10 terabyte product, et cetera. But we don't see anything that would particularly affect our aggregate share. Over time, we do expect some normalizing of the capacity point share.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham & Company.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple questions. First, we get a lot of inbound questions about interest rates relative to the deal. Can you just talk a little bit about relative to your original expectations to fund the SanDisk transaction now and your ability to go and pay that debt level as the acquisition closes?","And then, secondly, in terms of the overall TAM, Mike, would you believe that the TAM hits a trough here in the March quarter? Or do you think that there's potential further weakness in the June quarter? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Rich, this is Steve, let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is that we did \u2013 we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective as well as volatility as it relates to supply\/demand dynamics in the NAND market. So we had stress cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bull case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction proved to be value-creating for our shareholders longer term. So we're very confident in that regard.","Additionally, as we approached the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases today have been within our expectations and we're confident that that will remain the case.","Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is \u2013 and there's additional detail to some degree in our S4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas of the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure. And so for those various reasons, I would emphasize that we continue to be very confident with regards to our ability to service the debt post close of the SanDisk transaction. So I'll ask Mike to comment on the TAM.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Yeah, so to answer your question, Rich, I think we would see this as the low point of the year. I'll give you a little additional color on it. Of the sequential decline that we're projecting, we would chalk up roughly two-thirds of that to typical seasonality as well as the secular changes in the market, the balance of that attributed to macro conditions. And I think we would also say that given the environment around us, we're seeing a normal planning bias from the markets to be more conservative around build expectations as well as around inventory position, and all that's factored into our outlook.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing, Rich, that I'd like to add to that is that we think that barring there being some other macroeconomic event that none of us can predict, that it appears that the calendar first quarter will be the low point from a TAM perspective as it relates to calendar 2016.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Excellent. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I want to go to the reported results. I think this quarter revenue was at the low end of your expectation, but gross margin, I think, you had initially guided to be up a little bit sequentially. So I'm curious of what the underlying drivers were to the relative shortfall in the gross margin line, and I do have a follow-up.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the relative shortfall in margin was due to two factors. One was product mix, which was the majority of the shortfall, and the balance was lower volume impacting our absorption cost.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, Aaron, the mix comment is really due to slightly lower enterprise volumes.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then sticking on the gross margin line as a follow-up, as you look at driving the synergy expectations that you expect of $250 million a year, and we look out to calendar 2017, relative to the mix change happening in the overall hard disk drive industry, should we not be thinking that the gross margin line is at the high end of the 27% to 32%? And if not, why not?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm not so sure I would go to that point at this stage, and there's a lot of moving parts in terms of what happens with gross margin. The one thing that \u2013 the biggest drag in terms of near-term on our gross margins, if you want to call it that, I mean, let's be honest, we still continue to have strong gross margin performance, but it's been weaker enterprise volumes. And it really has to do with what Mike was talking about in that the first half of calendar year 2015 had a higher mix of enterprise volumes and then there was an absorption of that \u2013 those drives in the back half. We will see that kind of flip and go to normal seasonality in calendar year 2016.","So all things remaining equal, we should see our margins begin to benefit from that higher gross margin level as we exit calendar year 2016. But, of course, there can be other factors including pricing which can impact things, there can be total volumes. And so I don't know if I want to be specific at this point as to when we'll end up closer to that high end of that range. But we're certainly going to do everything in our power to make it happen from an execution and from a product perspective.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions as well. One, appreciate all the color on the MOFCOM centric savings that you guys are providing. I'm curious, how do you think about cash conversion cycle and CapEx numbers trending, given the fact that you're able to integrate these assets? And what's the right way to think of those factors?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the cash conversion cycle, we expect the impact to be minimum. We are going to have some impact on inventory, for example, but we wouldn't factor a (31:37) major improvement. In CapEx, being at the low end of our range, even in the range of 4% is not a bad assumption.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. And then, I guess, if I just follow up on some of the discussions before, Steve, what's the comfort level you have today to the best you can talk about that the Unis investment comes in the way it was initially structured and doesn't really change? And I want to clarify, you guys are going to seek a shareholder vote on the SanDisk transaction even if you don't need it, i.e., even if you don't have to issue 20% equity, right?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, that's correct. We will be seeking shareholder vote in any scenario. Yes, you're correct. Regarding our confidence level in terms of CFIUS ruling this to be a non-covered transaction, let me make a couple of comments on that. First thing is, which we've said repeatedly, is that we were very careful with regards to how we structured the transaction. And based upon that, we do not believe it's a covered transaction. Now, that being said, this is up to the CFIUS committee and the U.S. government to decide. And, frankly, that's very difficult at this stage to handicap. So I'm not sure that I want to go there in terms of trying to predict that. We want to certainly respect the decision-making process that the government goes through. We'll continue to engage with them and work with them. But clearly, we were very careful with how we structured the transaction.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you and best luck, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Olivier, could you maybe help us provide more financing detail for the debt you're planning to raise, especially given that SanDisk pays 31% \u2013 32% tax rate, any tax savings synergies from tax if you could share with us? Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we believe and we have \u2013 we believe we can optimize the tax structure of SanDisk. We haven't provided much more details than that. And on the debt, if you want to look at the details of the debt, I will refer to our S4 filing, which has all the details of the debt, including the various instruments we'd be using, Monika.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","All right, thanks. Then, Steve, maybe could you talk about when do you plan to start using SanDisk NAND in your enterprise SSDs so you could see the margin benefit?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the short answer is as soon as we can, as soon as we possibly can, but obviously we've got to close the transaction and begin more formally the integration process, et cetera, et cetera so that \u2013 we don't have a specific time on that. But clearly, from a financial and from a product perspective, we're highly motivated to make that happen as quickly as we can from a product development and lifecycle perspective.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Sterne Agee CRT.","Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Thanks very much. On cost cutting, I'm curious if I could ask two questions if I'm allowed. One is just on the guide for the gross margin in the March quarter being up sequentially. Is that already because you're starting to actually get HGST COGS savings? In other words, would it have otherwise been probably down as would normally be the case?","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it would be a mix of both, better mix, slightly, but also starting to realize some of the synergies.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Small amount, Rob.","Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT","Yeah, okay. So actually there is some mix benefit there, I guess. And then second question I guess is just with \u2013 I appreciate that the $400 million in OpEx cuts you guys have been talking about all along, so that makes sense. But frankly, if you look at the TAM now, it's structurally lower than it was a year or so ago. So would it not actually be fair to think that something beyond the $400 million would actually make really more sense at this stage? Or is it just the fact you'd rather leave that as a separate \u2013 that's like a separate item, your HGST overlapping and you've got something else? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, Rob, it's an interesting question because you're right, the $400 million we've been talking about for frankly three-and-a-half years, four years, if my memory is correct. But one thing that I would comment on is that subsequent to that period, as individual entities, there have been a number of OpEx reduction efforts that have occurred since that time. And so the actual reduction in our operating expenses from the close of the HGST, WD transaction is actually much greater than an annual run rate of $400 million. For example, if you remember, the WD sub was engaged in the performance enterprise market. We have exited \u2013 on the WD side, that business was exited, the OpEx savings were saved there. And so net, kind of apples-to-apples, we've actually reduced our OpEx more than that original $400 million that we talked about three-and-a-half years ago.","Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal","Next question please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Stan Kovler with Citi Research.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. I'm with Citi. As far as the cost savings goes, I was wondering if you could elaborate on cost savings beyond the HGST savings. At what point does the TAM get low enough where you would consider core capacity reductions to some degree? My first question. I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a fair question. We constantly look at that, constantly look at that. And again, kind of going back to the comment that I made to Rob Cihra's question is that we have been \u2013 as the TAM has come down over the last few years, we have been continuing to rationalize our business to a lower volume base. So it's something that we dynamically and consistently evaluate and we'll continue to do so as we move forward.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And just on the transaction, if I could. What's your sense of the Unis investment going through, if in the case that CFIUS does deem it a covered transaction, could that still be something that they're interested in to go through that process and continue with their investment? And on the flipside, if they do wind up backing out for some reason or other considerations, is it possible to restructure the deal at this point to include more debt to lower the dilution in that second scenario of getting shareholder approval and buying SanDisk before the Unis transaction closes? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Again, fair question. I'm not going to go there. At this point, our priority is working to satisfy the closing conditions as it relates to the Unis investment, including getting through the CFIUS process. To speculate at this point as to what happens if the U.S. government considers it to be a covered transaction, it's a little bit early to do that. So I'm not going to dare do that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall, JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is regarding visibility. I wonder if you could just remind us what the lead times look like right now for drives. And what gives you confidence that you have visibility beyond March, given the market seems so unpredictable at this stage? And then I've got a follow-up.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","So relative to the visibility of demand, we have some improving insight, actually, as these businesses mature to plans for data center build outs and what's going to be required to do that, and what our proportion of that might be. So we continue to refine our engagement with those customers such that we get a more insightful view into it.","Relative to our drive lead times, it depends on the type of drive that we're talking about. Anywhere from sort of four weeks to eight weeks would be a good planning number, larger capacity being a bit longer and that's due to test time.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And suffice it to say that given kind of the market volatility that we've seen, the anxiousness that's been out there, we are clearly taking a \u2013 as well as our customers are taking a very cautious view with regards to the demand outlook, particularly here in the near-term. We believe that's the prudent thing to do. But as always in terms of the way that we manage our business, if demand happens to be higher than what we would expect, we'll be there to meet that opportunity.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up was just \u2013 I don't know if you guys are able to estimate this, but do you have any idea where inventory levels stand on the consumer side right now, in weeks or some sort of a duration sort of an estimate? And I guess, on enterprise, the same question, although I suppose that's much harder to estimate.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we don't necessarily have any specific data on that other than to indicate we think that inventory levels are pretty healthy. And what I mean by healthy is relatively lean and in pretty good shape. In other words, we don't think that there is any, call it, excess inventory. We had seen that through calendar year 2015, particularly with some of the \u2013 in the PC market. We believe that that's worked its way through the system. And so in that regard \u2013 I mean, this is a positive statement. We don't believe that there's an inventory overhang that we or the broader industry need to deal with.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I guess I was thinking on the other side of it, it seems like inventory ought to be getting very lean out there. And I just wondered how stretched is the inventory level?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't have a good sense for that. I mean, I don't think we have a call on that right now. So I hope you're right, I'll put it that way.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Steve, there's talk of Toshiba potentially exiting hard drives. Not to ask you to directly comment on the rumor mill, but instead if it did take place, curious on your view at what would happen to those assets from an industry point of view.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That I'm not going to speculate on. I mean, I don't really know. I don't know what Toshiba's plans are. I mean, that's obviously a question for them and what would they do, would they sell them? I don't know. That's not a question that I'm going to speculate on.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","All right, fair enough. Maybe as a quick follow-up, could you just clarify on the enterprise SSD commentary? Growth will pause, did you actually expect to decline year-over-year? That seems a little aggressive just based on a product transition. And along with that, when \u2013 do you expect to show that 25% to 30% growth for calendar 2016 still?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I mean if you look at, we had $270 million of revenue last quarter. I believe a year ago we had about $230 million of revenue. So we've got a tough compare. Obviously, we're still in the midst of the quarter, but it's possible that we might see our year-on-year revenue down a bit, going into calendar Q1. And as far as the fiscal year, we would prefer not to be short-term focused in terms of that. But it's really, when we talk about exceeding industry growth rates, it's over a longer period of time. It's a little bit too early to say whether or not our growth this year will accelerate or decelerate versus that. So it's not really an indication one way or the other, but I'd prefer not to comment on that specifically.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Just looking at your enterprise sales from the first two quarters of this fiscal year, they're significantly below what they were a year ago. In fact, your sales this quarter I think were the lowest since first quarter of fiscal 2013. Just wondering, with the anticipated growth of the cloud, that's somewhat surprising to me. And how much of this is macro? And is there anything else going on with that number?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Mark, just to clarify, you must be looking at units, right?","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Yes.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I think one of the things that we need to continue to focus on is the petabyte growth as opposed to the unit growth. Obviously, as we ship higher capacity points, we're going to ship, all things remaining equal, fewer units. So as Mike indicated, we continue to see strong petabyte growth. The number that we're estimating is 32% which is \u2013 well, longer term, 35%. This past year for us was 32%, which is pretty consistent with our expectation.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","And just final, if you could just explain, in terms of the conversion, whether Unis goes through, I think if Unis doesn't go through it's like 0.24 shares of Western Digital for each SanDisk share. Is the price set on that? Or would you have to give more shares because the price has come down?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The exchange ratio and the price has been fixed.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","And are you at liberty to say what the price \u2013 the fixed price is?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I believe it was $79.50.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question is on your prepared remarks, Steve, you mentioned a combination of both cyclical and secular factors were causing the weaker outlook. Can you talk more on some of the secular changes that you're seeing and to what extent any secular pressure from flash versus hard drive has accelerated? And in particular I'd be interested in any changes you're seeing in the enterprise segment.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me take client first. We see that continuing trend toward client SSDs, particularly in commercial class notebooks. It still remains within our planning guideline. So we don't see it accelerating beyond our expectation, but it is steadily increasing and it's certainly factored into that outlook.","Relative to the enterprise, we do see, as evidenced by our own SAS enterprise SSD strategy, we do see the beginnings of the incursion of enterprise SSD into what is traditionally performance enterprise. And a way to think about that is it starts at the top first with 15,000 RPM drives as being the first area for that conversion to begin, and then later on it will be others. But we do see incursion in both those segments, all of which is happening within the rate of \u2013 that we have planned in our outlook. So that would be the color I can give you.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then a clarification question on some of the prior SanDisk comments. I know you said you used a range of planning assumptions, but clearly there's a lot of NAND market weakness and also interest rates and other factors. Is the comment that you made on the last \u2013 or on the SanDisk call about 10% accretion, is that still the right number for us to be thinking about, or has that changed?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's still the correct number.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Just two if I could. One is \u2013 the first one is, one of the most frequent questions that we've gotten over the last few months with regards to the SanDisk deal is around Toshiba's ability, or I guess sort of Toshiba's positioning currently on 3D NAND IP development. So, Steve, was just wondering if you could remind us, in that regard, of the due diligence that you guys did in leading up to the announcement of the deal, and your comfort in that regard, with regards to 3D NAND. That would be awesome. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So just to remind everybody, as part of our due diligence, as it relates to the SanDisk acquisition is that we did extensive technical due diligence related to where SanDisk\/Toshiba was with regards to the 3D NAND transition. That, we were very comfortable with where they were at and continue to be very comfortable with where they're at with their transition, and are particularly encouraged by the recent announcements that they made in conjunction with their earnings announcement, which indicates that they are now commercially shipping their 48 layer 3D NAND product into the marketplace.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Thanks. And then I guess my follow-up is, commensurate with your TAM comments with September \u2013 I'm sorry, March, being the calendar year low, could you share with us what your PC view is this year? And to what extent, if any, we may be able to see some enterprise refresh or commercial refresh as we get to the second half of this year? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So relative to \u2013 I'll let Mike address the enterprise refresh. But in terms of PCs, we have not been bullish on the PC market for a while. And we would see, generally speaking, the rate of decline in the PC market to be a bit less than what it's been this past calendar year. And maybe something in 6%, 5%, something like that kind of range on a full-year basis. But as I indicated, we continue to be not particularly optimistic from an overall perspective regarding what's happening in the PC market, and our financial plans and future plans are not highly contingent on that. Mike? Enterprise outlook?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So I think on an enterprise outlook basis, I sort of referenced it, on the capacity enterprise segment, we see that continuing to progress. We see an increasing adoption of Helium flash drives as the people deploying infrastructure realize the benefits of the TCO that that technology offers. We articulated that growth rate we would expect across that total segment.","Relative to the performance category, I just talked a little bit about that. We do see the continuing penetration of flash-based products into that marketplace. We see that continuing through the balance of the year, as evidenced by a number of people in their systems announcements most recently. We would expect that to benefit from that obviously with our strategy of being media agnostic as we move forward with the completion of the SanDisk acquisition.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Thanks a lot. Very helpful.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for joining us today. In summary, we continue to execute well in a challenging environment and we're taking proactive steps to maintain and extend our cost leadership in the HDD industry. We're also pleased with our progress on our strategic efforts to diversify and strengthen the company for the long term, including the acquisition of SanDisk. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress on all fronts. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now we'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance and our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, our product portfolio, product features, development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, and our joint venture partnership and business ventures with Toshiba.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017.

Thank you in advance for that, and I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.","We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39. With three consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies.","We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products, enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. And I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations.","The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions. Strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry, our team continues to execute very well on two key strategic priorities. The integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on.","I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba, driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. Our goals throughout this, the current process, have remained consistent and resolute.","First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry, and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over its 17-year duration. Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.","We are committed to continuing this storied partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders. And we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation.","I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong. And the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to the favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and this helped mitigate typical seasonality. We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology, and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well.","In client devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications, while traditional commute demand was softer as expected. Demand for our solid-state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attach rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs, enabling us to expand our market presence. We commenced shipments of our 64-layer, 3D NAND in client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017.","In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our three-bit per-cell x3 offerings. Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things.","Turning to client solutions, our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. The strong appeal of our WD, SanDisk and G-Technology brand continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis.","In data center devices and solutions, we saw sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter. Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth-generation helium product, underscoring our generational lead in this category. I'm pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch four years ago.","From a memory, technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. These achievements are particularly noteworthy, indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies.","Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018 somewhat higher than in 2017. When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry's supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation.","Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.3 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance.","Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our March quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We saw sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD. Client solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products.","Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.","Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation, driven by our better-than-expected financial results. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth.","Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated term loan B and our U.S.-dollar term loan B. The aggregate annual savings from these two repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings starting in our June quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.","In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity.","Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.","As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost-of-revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis.","With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.","I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017 we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%.","Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65 with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares.","As we described in detail during our last investor day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12.00 for the full calendar year 2017.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to focus in on the NAND business a little bit and just see if you could talk to us about the ASP trajectory in the quarter, and how we should be thinking about ASPs as we look forward and we compare back to the spot market, relative to what you guys are recognizing. Any comment on your thoughts on bit growth would also be interesting, given Samsung continues to save 30% so you guys are a little higher than them. Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","This is Mike. Let me give you comments on both. First on ASP, as you know, most of our bits are sold in products, not in the open market or at the component level, so we have realized pricing gains but \u2013 and we expect that favorable trend to continue through the back half of the year. But I would not peg us directly to the spot market price because of the way we go to market. Secondly, I think I noted the low end of the range, obviously the low end of the range being around 35%. I think we're \u2013 we remain comfortable that the industry will be in that neighborhood.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. We learned this today that former CEO of SanDisk and Chairman, just joined Micron. And, Mike, I want to better understand whether the things that you have put in place to safeguard from any potential recruiting of key assets, especially on the SanDisk side. And I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, well, part of \u2013 this is Steve, Mehdi. Part of our job is, no matter who shows up at what places, that our most important asset is our people. And part of the things that we try to do on a routine basis, is make sure that not only do they remain with our company, but that they're motivated and giving 110%, if you want to call it that, to the performance of the company, and we're going to continue to do that going forward, frankly, no matter who shows up at which one of the companies that may have an interest in recruiting our people.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. And then as follow up, going back to your helium-based product, how should we think about the mix between 10- and 12-terabyte, and do you have any assessment of your market share as helium-based products are further penetrating the install base?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, let me comment. I think as the year progresses, we would see the increasing deployment as a percentage of the total of 10-terabyte, which we feel very comfortable with our current product capability as well as our design win outlook across the major consumers of that product. Later in the year we may see some 12-terabyte begin to happen at greater scale, so that transition has begun. We also see ourselves in a good position from a exabyte share perspective, and we would think those trends will continue in a positive manner throughout the year.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first off, just on the 40% gross margin guide that you guys have for June quarter, could you just talk about what's driving the upside versus your longer-term model? And is it reasonable to think that both the NAND and HDD segments at this point are probably tracking well ahead of your long-term targets for each of those segments?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, I think right now we're seeing a combination of stable HDD market and a strong flash market, so it's that combination that's resulting in the 40% gross margin.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","And strong execution, both from just an operational perspective and from a cost perspective, which obviously that part of it is something that we'll be doing in effect independent of the demand or pricing environment.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Exactly. And I do think on a go-forward basis over the long-term, we do have more opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our cost structure, both through our transformation that is ongoing as we said and through the deployment of our new technology as they ramp. So I think we feel very good about the gross margin performance and the long term, as we said, earnings power of this platform.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And if I could just follow-up, Steve, you talked about working with Toshiba to come up with a win-win solution with what's going on. Does that suggest that you're actually having more exclusive discussions with them at this point? And what do you think the time line to get a resolution on this process is from your perspective?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, the reality is we talk to Toshiba all the time. They're our partner, and so we have ongoing engagements with them or discussions with them at various different levels. The question with regards to timing, that I can't speculate on, and so I'm going to have to punt on the answer to speculating on that question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Fair enough. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the great execution, guys.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the operating expense line. Mark, I think a quarter or two ago you had talked about getting to a normalized operating expense level in the $770 million range for this March quarter. I know that you're guiding flat in the current quarter, but I'm curious of how you would currently characterize your normalized operating expense level as we start to look into the realization of the full synergies. And I have a real quick follow-up as well.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. I think the most important thing to keep in mind from an OpEx standpoint is we have these two factors. One is we have the higher incentive base comp that flows through when we significantly exceed our expectations.","So that's one part of it, but the second, and the more important part, is we are making ongoing investments that will enable future growth, as we see the opportunity to accelerate a number of our R&D projects. So we're doing that. As I also said, we're making continued investments in other areas of IT systems to make sure that we have the right platform for this sustainable growth.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then as a quick follow up, I'm curious. Based on maybe my math, it looks like you saw a healthy maybe uptick in the average capacity per hard disk drive, and I'm wondering if you could talk about what you've seen there? And how we should think about that trajectory going forward?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Well, I think two dimensions. One is there's the normal seasonality, some of the lower capacity segments in the market were running at a lower rate in the period just closed. So you get the mix up effect that happens there.","But the other one that's maybe more important and secular is, as we transition to 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte in capacity enterprise and as that segment takes on a disproportionately important role for us, that will continue to drive capacity per unit up. And as I commented earlier, we expect that to continue through the balance of this year and beyond.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham and Co. Your line is now open.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions. First Mark, on the inventory side, days inventory increased or \u2013 is that just linearity in the quarter? Were you careful with shipping towards the end on any pricing issues? And then I have a follow up.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. Rich, it was actually simpler than that. We had inventory build that was a function of a buffer for our ongoing transformation. And then we did have some inventory builds based on anticipated demand. So it was...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Primarily long lead time kind of stuff, right?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yes.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","With the fairly strong demand we're seeing in capacity enterprise.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","That's right.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 thank you. And then secondly, when it comes to the industry, the NAND side, returning to a more normal environment, I mean, how should we think about that, Mike? Is that something that's going to happen all at once? Or you think it will be a gradual thing in 2018?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Sort of hard to be specific. I think what we \u2013 sort of the new news from us on this call that we've been talking about through the end of the calendar year, now our visibility would tell us, we think it's going to remain in a constrained environment sort of through the first half of 2018. How that evolves ultimately, hard to tell, Rich.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, thank you very much and the $12 number, thanks for providing that. That's very helpful and impressive.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Steve, you said regarding Toshiba that WD should lead and help implement this transaction that would be good for all stakeholders. I was wondering what sort of ownership changes are you philosophically opposed to and why? Maybe without going into specifics of companies, but what sort of things are concerning to you regarding some of the options that were out there? Was it IP risk? Was it operational risk? What sort of things, if you could handicap that? And I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, I'm not going to get into the details of that on this call. One, a lot of this has been speculation in the press in terms of other bidders. And so I'd rather not get into the details of, one, our view on the situation, nor speculate on what's happening with some of these other supposed bidders.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. As my follow-up, sounds like your view on the tightness of the NAND environment, I think you guys just commented that's pushed out to first half of 2018. If you were to say, is this more a function of higher demand from newer applications or lower yields in NAND, causing supply shortages? How would you probably rank order those? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, I think \u2013 and this is Steve. I think it's a little bit of, kind of all of the above, so to speak. But one of the things that we need to understand is that this conversion \u2013 and it is a conversion as opposed to new capacity. This conversion to 3D NAND is difficult. It's difficult for all of us. We believe that we're executing in a very solid and sound fashion and demonstrated by the fact that we now achieve cost crossover with our 1Z platform. But this is tough stuff, and so it maybe is taking a little bit longer from a conversion standpoint and from a yield perspective than what people estimated. And so therefore, the bit growth rate is a little bit lower than all of us expected, and demand continues to be strong, driving a tight environment.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thanks, Steve. Congrats on the great execution.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","You're clearly operating toward the high end of your long-term gross margin model that you just laid out four months ago with what looks like legacy SanDisk operating with a five handle in front of it. NAND ASPs are clearly helping you and you're still in process of your 64-layer ramp, but I was hoping you could touch on the opportunities to further expand your margins within the hard drive business and specifically enterprise, as your overall margins were a record this quarter despite what looks like softer enterprise units this quarter. And I have a follow-up, please.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, I think there's two areas, and then Mark will have some details. So one is, is we continue to progress forward into the 10- and 12-terabyte in capacity enterprise. That's obviously helpful to our hard drive margins. The other thing is, which was also referenced, we are not through the transformation and restructuring and integration, which will help us optimize our cost basis. So both of those things are ongoing and continue through this year and into next year.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And just...","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Yes.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sorry. Go ahead.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Oh, no. I was just going to say a key part of the model is that given the diversified product portfolio, we have a number of operating levers that we can use to manage and optimize good environments and manage volatility in more challenging environments. So we feel very good about how that platform is evolving.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, you have begun to make meaningful progress on integrating Hitachi. But relative to your SanDisk integration efforts, there's still a lot of runway left and I was hoping you could just indicate where you are in the process of qualifying legacy SanDisk NAND into your own enterprise SSD business. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes. So, I think, as we've discussed before, we are actually qualifying our own NAND into products as they are developing and they enter the market. We remain quite happy with our relationship with Intel, and if you think about it that way, it's actually incremental bits that we are providing to the market, so it's a net accretive or positive thing. So at this point, we are going to continue on through a generation or two, more products with our relationship with Intel, and we'll really up our participation of our own NAND in the enterprise through development and launch of new products within our portfolio.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","And that vertical integration that you're talking about really is \u2013 was not contemplated in that initial $500 million of total synergies for the 18-month window. The lion's share of that will be reflected in the 2020 target of $1.1 billion of synergies.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Co. Your line is now open.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","There has been a leadership in the helium drives you've exercised for four years. Seagate has, I think, led in the shingled media area, but both firms are making progress in the areas that they were not originally leading in. I'm just wondering, do you see both firms coming to parity in each of those areas next year in terms of introduction of products and the quality of their products in shingled and in helium-filled drives?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I'm not going to speculate on that, Mark. I mean, we don't know where Seagate is and what progress they're making. I can tell you that our focus is on executing on our plans. And so in that regard, we will not be striving for parity.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","What about the shingled media drives? Any estimates on what percentage of drives will be shingled media or are you going to just...","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","We haven't really provided that information. I mean, shingle's been a little bit more limited in terms of the applications because of some of the performance implications of that and that sort of thing. But we feel comfortable with where we're at in terms of SMR transition and the applicability and the drives that we're providing to our customers.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Congratulations and keep up the impressive results. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes. Hi. I had a question. So, just looking at the Toshiba side, obviously, you guys are having a lot of negotiations there. Is there \u2013 do you guys have a right of first refusal? I know you have concentrates, but is there a right of first refusal and is there a time line to that process?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","We have consent provisions, is what we have regarding any transferred assets and JV provisions, as I've mentioned earlier.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. But is there a time line to that process at all or...?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Well, similarly, the answer to the question, I'm not going to speculate on time lines.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And the second question is that \u2013 on the NAND side, as you look at the 14 and 64 ramp, what's the mix in the back half and what's the \u2013 how do the gross margins look?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Well, we talked about our mix in the back half. It would be 75% of our 3D-bit output will be 64 layer exiting the calendar year.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","And that's for the \u2013 no, that's for the full calendar year, which means that by the time you get to the back half, the lion's share of our output in terms of 3-D is going to be 64 layer.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","We're already transitioning out of 48 into 64. 48 layer was more of a learning platform for us, if you want to call it that, as opposed to something that we intended to extensively productize and ship. It was really for our learnings.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter, guys.","Stephen D.

","And with that I turn the call over to Western Digital\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.","Steve Milligan","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. ","After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter. This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment in our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM, and planned acquisition of SanDisk, coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I am very excited about the company\u2019s future and our ability to create long term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. ","We are proceeding with our integration in to a single company, as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition, and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. ","Turning to the September quarter, industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5 inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. ","We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.9%, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.","Our enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SaaS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally we continue to ramp our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering.","Revenue from our video surveillance hard drivers also continued its rapid growth, as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose or purpose build solutions. We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. ","We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8 terabyte helium drive and will be ramping our 10 terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. ","Overall, demand in the high capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers. ","Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the capacity enterprise sector will continue with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth and data bank created and stored. ","Looking to the PC market, we are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. ","Longer term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company in to a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base, and an expanded addressable market. ","Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook. ","Olivier Leonetti","Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.4 billion. We shipped a total of 51.7 million hard disk drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.9% and operating expenses totaled $567 million.","Tax expense for the September quarter was $31 million or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $366 million or $1.56 per share. In the September quarter, we generated $545 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $394 million. Our CapEx totaled $151 million or 4% of revenue. ","We repurchased 700,000 shares for $60 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion of which approximately $600 million was held in the US. ","I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be slightly up from the September quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $585 million, and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60. ","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","I have a question and a follow-up, just to start with, could you just talk about the benefit the MOFCOM approval have on your cash and rationability as you forward, and how do you think the timing of those benefits of flow and would be in sync with your P&L, and does MOFCOM help you get within the target of your cash conversion cycle of four to eight days. ","Steve Milligan","I\u2019ll take that and then Olivier can add a little bit of a color, and this is Steve. If you look at benefits that we expect from the revised MOFCOM ruling is that, first thing is that we expect to realize $400 million of annual operating expense savings and then we\u2019ve also commented that we\u2019ll have material cost synergies. We have not quantified what material means in terms of cost synergies. ","Generally speaking, the 400 million of operating expense savings would be roughly equivalent to cash savings as our OpEx. The cost savings that we would realize, which have not been quantified would be a mixture of cash and depreciation, that sort of thing. So it\u2019d be kind of a mixture. ","Olivier Leonetti","Yeah let me add two comments; first of all most of the cash will be generated offshore. We commented on that 90% of the benefit would be generated outside US. And from a cash conversion cycle we believe we\u2019re going to have some improvements but I wouldn\u2019t bank on many days. ","Steve Milligan","I can comment on that because there\u2019s a little bit of perspective, the four to eight days we announced that I think it was back in September of 2002 or \u201903. It will help, sorry at this track of time, but you know shortly after the acquisition the composition of our business has changed dramatically since then particularly a lower percentage from a PC business which tended to have a higher cash conversion to more of an enterprise mix which has a slower cash conversion. So we\u2019re going to need to reset at some point what that cash conversion cycle from a business perspective should be for our company. ","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. Just as a follow-up could you talk about gross margin dynamic in the September quarter was up 60 basis points so you planned, mix looks like may be a part of it, but was there anything else especially from a pricing perspective that sort of impeded your gross margins. ","Olivier Leonetti","All of it was actually mix, higher mix of gaming and higher mix of notebook and branded products. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","One question and one follow-up as well. Olivier, I think you had made a comment that your operating expense in the current quarter is expected to be 585. I just want to clarify that, and if that\u2019s true, just curious on what\u2019s the upper driver here in this current quarter, and again kind of going back to Amit\u2019s question, when can we start to actually see that OpEx come down as it relates to that MOFCOM. Is that over the next two or three quarters or is it further out? I think last week you had suggested that you should be through a lot of that by the time you get to that SanDisk closure. ","Olivier Leonetti","So different guidance for OpEx is a bit higher than our run rate due to incentive compensation. Following the December quarter, we would expect run rate OpEx to be in the range of 575 give or take before.","Steve Milligan","570.","Olivier Leonetti","575 give or take before MOFCOM synergies. Now in terms of MOFCOM synergies as indicated we will expect them to materialize between the next 12 and 24 months and would provide you an update on regular basis. ","Steve Milligan","The run rate OpEx free MOFCOM synergies is 570 million. ","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","But just to be fair, you are looking to drive that OpEx down and that\u2019s not going to happen. Should some of that start to happen before we even get to the 12 months, is what I am asking. ","Steve Milligan","The short answer is yes Aaron. What we haven\u2019t done which - let\u2019s keep in mind that prior to the revised ruling from MOFCOM we were precluded from doing any integration planning, and so we have begun detailed integration planning and all of that, and so we are not prepared at this point to indicate specifically a phasing or the timing of those OpEx synergies other than to indicate they\u2019ll take place over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. But clearly we\u2019re going to be looking at how we can bring those in as much as possible from a financial perspective while minimizing impact to our business. Okay. ","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","And then as a follow-up I\u2019m just curious on the capacity shipment trends. You talked a little bit about, it looks like you were down about 2% year-over-year in terms of total capacity shipped. Can you help us bridge what that capacity ship looks like between the PC business relative to your enterprise business and what\u2019s that [stranded] like. ","Steve Milligan"," I am not sure I follow that question Aaron.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","I guess relative to the 35% compound annual growth rate that you reference on the enterprise side going forward, just curious of how that growth looks like over the past few quarters within the total capacity ship number that you report. ","Steve Milligan","I got it. So Mike\u2019s going to take that question. ","Mike Cordano","Hi Aaron, so I think the way to think about it, we still think the calendar year is tracking to the 35% number may be slightly higher. We saw a little bit of front loading in the calendar year of that, and so that\u2019s being absorbed in the comments that Steve made earlier as we get in to the second half. So I think that trend we\u2019re confident in that, and that\u2019s specifically around the capacity enterprise segment. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is now open. ","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","A couple of questions, first on the capacity enterprise side, obviously that spans more than cloud service providers. Can you just talk about to the capacity enterprise cloud service provider part of your exabyte shipments, and how you would expect to trend over the next 6 to 12 month as you move especially to 10 terabyte? ","Steve Milligan","So Rich I\u2019ll take that question. As you know, we try to stay away from talking about specific either customers or types of customers. Obviously cloud service providers are a meaningful part of exabytes shipped on our part. But the absorption that I eluded to in my prepared remarks was a mixture of both traditional enterprise customers, if you want to call it that, as well as cloud service providers. ","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay, interesting. And then post SanDisk now, is there anything that you were contemplating on the Hitachi integration that now needs to be altered because of the SanDisk integration. Are there like facilities that perhaps now you need to keep or does it change, what could have happened in any way. ","Steve Milligan","Well I think the first thing to keep in mind Rich is that, given the complimentary nature of the SanDisk and Western Digital transaction, it\u2019s a different kind of an integration in that regard. That\u2019s an important thing to contemplate. ","Simplistically, the answer to your question is, no it doesn\u2019t really alter anything. There are some additional things that we\u2019ll have to think about that add a bit more complexity, for example, systems integrations and things like that. So we\u2019ll have to look at not only the pre-existing WD and HGST systems, but also what platform is SanDisk on and how do we kind of manage that process. ","But other than a few items like that, we intend to more or less perceive full steam in terms of the integration on the WD\/HGST side. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Steve on your comments about absorption on the capacity side, can you help us think through either how much do you think incremental demand half core, half migrated in to the first half versus second half for the calendar year because of those purchases or alternatively how much of the absorption do you think we are through and what innings are we in in that, and I have a follow-up.","Steve Milligan","Well let me comment on it this way, one of the things that we talked about in our last earnings call and also I believe our largest competitor also commented on it is typically the, I\u2019ll call it the mix exabytes that gets shipped. You have about 40% that typically gets shipped in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. And if you look back, and that\u2019s calendar year, right, not our fiscal year. ","And that percentages held kind of pretty consistent over a number of years. This year roughly speaking, we are looking at something that\u2019s more like 45 and 55. So that will help kind of dimension a bit. And we would expect that that absorption of capacity or exabyte shipped, that absorption will continue through the balance of this calendar year, and begin to, if you want to call it abate as we begin next calendar year. ","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then on the Nearline side, clearly you took some share over there. As you had some customers migrate to the 8 terabyte drivers, can you talk about what happened with the pricing on a like-for-like basis for the 4 and 6 terabyte and did that influence margins, thanks. ","Steve Milligan","Well the short answer is that, that\u2019s not something that we call that as a particular driver of our margin performance. I mean Olivier commented on the decline that we saw on our gross margin was driven entirely by mix, and that being a stronger mix of lower margin products namely drives the gaming console as well as 2.5 drives that go in notebooks, consistently have been below the corporate average. ","That\u2019s what impacted our margin, and whether or not other thing impacted, we are not calling anything else specifically. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Rod Hall - JP Morgan","I just wanted to ask about the regional trends particularly Europe but may be also the US. The European year-over-year growth deteriorating quite a bit in the quarter to minus 15% from minus 8 last quarter; so I wondered if you guys could give us a little color on what\u2019s going on there, is that just consumer demand deteriorating or there are other things happening. ","And then same for the North American region, down 6% after being up 16.5. Is that just datacenter or cloud oriented stuff or can you give us a little bit of color on those regional trends. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything particularly to call out other than Europe has been weak from call it a broader macroeconomic perspective. It\u2019s always difficult to draw conclusions from our geographic data because so much of our product is manufactured in Asia or is passed on to customers that manufacture in Asia, so it doesn\u2019t really speak to the end market, but we have seen some as you know and the macroeconomic situation in Europe has kind of impacted some of our more retail oriented business, but I am not sure I would call out anything specific beyond that. ","Rod Hall - JP Morgan","And the European drives I guess are more Europe linked is that correct? Whereas elsewhere you get more especially in Asia it leaks out in to other regions or is that the wrong way to see things. ","Steve Milligan","Well probably in Europe you\u2019re right, because there isn\u2019t a lot of manufacturing done in Europe, right. North American you get a little bit of a mix because there are some manufacturing our systems that may go elsewhere and certainly in Asia. But Europe\u2019s a little bit more of a true number. But Europe\u2019s been from a broader perspective weak for a while.","Mike Cordano","Yeah, you\u2019re not the only ones. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. ","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Can you hear me okay?","Steve Milligan","Sure. ","Steven Fox - Cross Research","But not that great. Just one question just switching gears, could you talk about your solid-state drive business a little bit? I think you mentioned a little bit of capacity issues or rather competitive issues are increasing during the quarter and then relative to average capacities and some of the trends you mention in the enterprise, how do those relate to what\u2019s going on in SSDs, utility and to the rest of the calendar year. And that\u2019s all I had, thanks. ","Steve Milligan","We\u2019ve enjoyed through strong product execution etcetera a pretty strong market position in an enterprise SSD business. It\u2019s a very competitive market as I eluded to in my comments and quite simply, not for anyone particular issue or another other than just increased competition and we gave back a little bit of our share on in this past quarter.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","And just in terms of average capacities or how the business trends through the rest of the year?","Steve Milligan","Overall or enterprise SSD, specifically.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Just enterprise SSDs.","Steve Milligan","That\u2019s nothing surprising we continue to see as product generation gets announced, we continue to see an upward trend in average capacity shipment. ","Operator","Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jeffries. Your line is open.","James Kisner - Jeffries","So my question is just regarding seasonality, I believe on the June quarter call you guys talked about seasonality being abnormal because of just the depressed nature of client demand primarily. But just wanted to get update your thoughts, I\u2019d like you to comment ideally sort of effects MOFCOM just the seasonality of earnings in this fiscal after having a couple more quarters or at least another quarter under your belt. ","Steve Milligan","I don\u2019t know if I call it. If you look at seasonality, if you look at the client\u2019s business, client plus gaming which really drove most of the increase in TAM from calendar Q2 to calendar Q3, the seasonal uptick in that regard was pretty consistent with what we normally see. It\u2019s normally up anywhere from 6%, 7%, 8%, something in that kind of range, and that\u2019s kind of what we saw in those segments of the market. ","The other things that\u2019s happened is that, while we used to see further increase in volumes in calendar Q4, that\u2019s kind of dissipated or gone away as our customers generally build earlier in the year and then they will put those on boats or longer transport kind of things to save transportation cost. ","So the seasonality from calendar Q3 to Q4 which has been going on for a while is much more muted, hence our view of a flattish TAM going in to calendar Q4. ","James Kisner - Jeffries","I guess sort of still wondering here, you are obviously massively under shipping and market demand, and I think units are down 30% on the client side. I am just wondering if there is hope at all here to see more recovery to closer to end market demand. ","Steve Milligan","Well we\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019ve said this before, although we\u2019ve seen some signs of stabilization in the PC market, I would not necessarily characterize us as being particularly bullish on that segment. And we have seen, there was inventory draw down through the whole kind of supply chain that\u2019s impacted our business a little bit in terms of where we may be at a sync a bit in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from an overall PC unit perspective.","And then additionally, we continue to see penetration of client SSDs in those systems, consistent with our expectations though by the way, but that further disconnects us from the overall unit numbers that you might see from a PC perspective. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Hi guys this is Keith here, sorry if there\u2019s any background noise. But my question I want to focus back on the SanDisk still because I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to ask a question. More specifically I am still struggling to see how the SanDisk deal is creating shareholder value. One of the ten multiple companies is buying a 30 multiple company. ","And Steve the question I want to pose to you if I could, I want to understand what your fundamental assumption is about the SanDisk (inaudible) as you look out over the next two to three years and how do you reach that conclusion particularly with some thoughts surrounding what I think about is the retail business or the replacement and card and then I have a follow-up also related to SanDisk. ","Steve Milligan","The short answer to your question Keith is do we expect the SanDisk business to grow overtime? The answer to that is yes. And we see growth opportunities won and helping to expand our broader footprint in terms of the enterprise SSD area where we think that not normally is that an area that\u2019s outpacing overall market growth but also a higher value opportunity to us. ","We also think that there\u2019s growth opportunities in terms of client SSDs as well, certainly as it relates to our base business, and additionally we think that there is growth opportunity in terms of embedded solution [investor] things, so you\u2019ve got tablets, cellphones etcetera (inaudible). ","Yes, related to the removables or the retail segment, that\u2019s a great business but it\u2019s not a growing business. So we fully understand and acknowledge that. ","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And may be if I could ask my follow-up then on the cost side, during the conference call last week I think you articulated broader synergies call it $500 million, and if I look at the cost structure of SanDisk alone, I would have thought there would have been more on OpEx, but maybe I did understand the characterization because you\u2019re combining, maybe I didn\u2019t understand the characterization of the 500 million opportunity, but I would have thought the companies there\u2019d be frankly more opportunities to reduce costs over the next couple of years beyond 500 million. But if you could just flush that out a little bit and then I\u2019ll cease the floor.","Steve Milligan","Sure. So a couple of comments on that. So when we talked about $500 million of synergies related to the SanDisk acquisition, we were specifically talking about, that was within 18 months of the close of the transaction. We did not indicate that that was the total synergies. In other words we do think that those there are additional opportunities. We have not quantified those or publicly talked about those at this point. ","The additional thing is that regarding that $500 million of synergies the lion share of that is related to the advantage that we would get by being vertically integrated as it relates principally to our enterprise SSD business. And there are some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that breakout specifically. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Steve I think you said you thought of the TAM and the fourth calendar quarter would be roughly flat. I was hoping if you could provide some detail on the different markets you mentioned that the PC market appears to be stabilizing. Can you give us some sort of directional commentary on the different end market for HDDs.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, I\u2019ll give a little bit of color on that. So we would expect and these are pretty small changes though by the way. We would expect that we\u2019ll see some softening in terms of gaming demand as well as in notebook demand offset by a little bit better enterprise demand. Again these are subtle changes that drives some of our margin improvement because we\u2019ll get a little bit - when things play out the way we expect we\u2019ll get a little bit of the mix benefit as a consequence of that. ","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","And then I think you also mentioned in your commentary that the active archive system is expected to drive meaningful revenue next year. Can you help us understand what type of TAM you think that product has, what\u2019s the revenue opportunity for that product. Thank you. ","Steve Milligan","So as we define that the active archive TAM we see that is a multi-billion dollar total addressable market for that solution. There\u2019s both sort of currently defined version of that as well as we think a new green field opportunities to create market with that solution given its value propositions. So I would look at it as a multi-billion dollar market and growing at a fairly fast clip.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. ","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Steve question on SanDisk acquisition, running a dry business is quite different than running a leading edge memory technology business. So maybe could you talk about the plan to retain SanDisk (inaudible) R&D team, and any execution risk in the integration you see. ","Steve Milligan","So Monika, SanDisk has got some great people. We look forward to welcoming them to the team and we certainly intend to retain the talent that exists there, and certainly that talent that relates to those parts of the business that we don\u2019t necessarily have the same experience, and then that\u2019s certainly the semiconductor business. So we look forward to bringing them onboard. ","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Do you see any execution risk in the integration?","Steve Milligan","Well there is execution risk in everything to be perfect, and the thing that I always focus the most on and investors will ask me often what do you worry about? I want to make sure that we everyday as a company dot I\u2019s and cross T\u2019s, and that\u2019s what we do better than any company on the planet and that\u2019s what we intend to do as we look to not only execute the WD\/HGST trend integration but also as it relates to future integration of SanDisk. And so absolutely are there risks and we are going to manage that carefully and I am going to keep our teams intensely focused on that. ","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","And then given that Unis is entrusting 15% stake in WD, do you think it could add any regulatory risk for getting approval for the SanDisk acquisition?","Steve Milligan","Well we are proceeding with our application, in fact our application regarding [macifious] process that is in and has been expected. We were very careful as to how we structured that transaction and Unis\u2019s representation on our Board, and we feel pretty good about that and we\u2019re proceeding with regulatory review at this point, and we\u2019ll keep you posted as things progress. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","I hope I do think your lead is in the 8 terabyte capacity drive space and then how would you expect that to change if at all as the industry moves to 10 terabytes. ","Steve Milligan","Well it\u2019s difficult to mention how far ahead we are, because we don\u2019t have perfect visibility in to where our competition is. But let me make this comment, our 10 terabyte drive which we haven\u2019t announced exactly when that will be available, its PMR based solution. And that\u2019s depending upon how you encounter our third or fourth generation helium drive.","There have been a lot of learnings along the way, and that we have developed and so when you got a three or four generation lead on your competition that\u2019s fairly material lead. Now that being said, we fully respect our competition and we are not going to rest on our laurels, and we are going to keep marching forward. ","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","And then a question on inventory, you commented on PC channel inventory coming down. Obviously we can see your balance sheet inventory that came down, but where do you think the industry is in terms of both channel inventory which has historically been quite low in recent quarters and also OEM inventory their manufacturing hubs. ","Olivier Leonetti","The inventory is still within our range in the lower end of the range nevertheless. ","Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley","And do you have any visibility in to the OEM inventory at their hubs?","Steve Milligan","We think that those are within comfortable ranges, but we don\u2019t have any specific visibility as to any issues. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini. Your line is open. ","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Going back to your commentary regarding some share shift in the SSD, how do you see this evolving in to next year? And I have a follow-up.","Steve Milligan","That\u2019s a difficult question to answer, how do we see share evolving in to next year. I mean obviously what we\u2019re going to continue to do is execute on our product plan and continue to delight our customers and share will turn out where it will turn out, and so we are going to try to earn our business every day.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Let me rephrase it as a follow-up, do you see new technologies like 3D NAND to become a catalyst looking to next year or your competitors just get in to margin and selling at a lower price. And as a follow-up to that, do you see a change in your driver especially SanDisk selling more of a hybrid product as a way to scale a rather niche segment of the market.","Steve Milligan","So let me comment on that, I think we see 3D as the next generation underlying media. We have plans to address products that are built on that in the future. So that will be part of our competitive profile and there are both of course economic benefit of that, but there are also product performance benefits in that architecture. So I think we\u2019ll see the market go through a transition and we have our own internal plans in which to undertake that. ","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","So is your competition just basically sitting at depressed price is that what the competition has done?","Steve Milligan","We see continued competition around that market as it progresses, nothing is sort of outside of our general expectations. ","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Got it. And quickly on a hybrid drive is your strategy changing here especially with SanDisk inked with the part of your portfolio. ","Steve Milligan","At this point we don\u2019t have any specific changes we\u2019d articulate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open. ","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Thanks guys for taking the question, two if I could, the first is, with regards to TAM, TAM and exabyte go down this TAM stabilized and you guys are expected to remain inside sort of any particular range, and then in that context, what is sort of the overall exabyte growth market for (inaudible) you guys are looking for over the next handful of years and then I have a follow-up, thanks. ","Olivier Leonetti","In terms of another overall exabyte growth for the market, we are predicting a 15% growth as a CAGR and particularly as it comes, capacity enterprise commented on that earlier, we see a 35% growth in CAGR. ","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","That\u2019s very useful and then anything on the TAM range?","Steve Milligan","Longer term, we would expect that TAM to be flat to may be down low single digits. ","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","And then just as follow-up, I guess our work really completes summers as kind of pointed to PC, SSD pricing including some OEM grade stuff becoming a little bit more aggressive, than its typically had been and mostly recently had that. Just interesting in getting your view on if you\u2019ve seen this yet, if it\u2019s impacted unit placement in anyway and if you expect it to potentially have an impact going forward and that\u2019s it. ","Steve Milligan","You\u2019re referring to PC\/OEM pricing?","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Yeah on the SSD side, yeah PC related. ","Steve Milligan","I would just comment that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything notable from our perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig- Hallum Capital. Your line is open.","Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital","Steve I\u2019m just wondering just back to SanDisk if you can explain the big question we get is whether this is defensive strategy or an offensive strategy. In other word, is buying SanDisk your absolute best strategy for you to take on given your decline in industry or is more an offensive strategy in the fact that you believe exabyte growth is going to continue to grow and HDDs and solid-state drives will co-exist for an extended period of time, and therefore you are best suited to serve a customer that\u2019s also consolidating.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so one comment and not to take offense to whether the question is phrased, but I don\u2019t know if I necessarily like the characterizing that is either offensive or defensive. This is a strategy that we\u2019ve thought about quite a bit. We think it is going to be good for our shareholders, good for our customers and it\u2019s going to allow our company and our business to grow. So if you want to characterize that as offensive then feel free to do so. ","Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then as you look at just the disk drive business Steve is my follow-up question, as we look out at a TAM that kind of follows a flat to low-single digit, given the mix and complexity of enterprise drives as well as bigger capacity branded drives being shipped, we\u2019ve made great progress on non-PC revenue as a mix of our business and actually over the last four years its modestly grown. Three or four years from now, do you believe that is the lion share of the percentage of revenue?","Steve Milligan","Yes. Now what percentage we\u2019ll have to see, and we certainly haven\u2019t called anything out publicly. But clearly the mix of our business in the traditional hard drive space is improving. And as it improves and as the PC related part becomes a frankly smaller and smaller part of our business, sooner or later there\u2019s going to be an inflexion point, it will begin to show improvement in revenues and in terms of the overall hard drive market as well as a better margin posture as it relates to that underlying business. So the hard drive business remains a great business, it\u2019s just a mix of shifting, right in a favorable way. ","Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital","I think several investors may be missing that. I appreciate you answering that. Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","First question is on the strategy of the company in China going forward and post all that you\u2019ve announced should we expect any changes in how WD plans to do business or any other types of partnerships you may be lucky to form especially given that (inaudible) has other - as we make another investment in collaboration with US technology.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, nothing to talk about at this point. Obviously we are going to continue to evaluate and think through our go-to-market strategy in China. China as a market first up it\u2019s a huge market, it\u2019s a growing market, its evolving market. As you see some of the hyper scale guys there grow or telecom companies\u2019 etcetera, etcetera, we\u2019re going to have to look at ways that we evolve our go-to-market capabilities in that market, but nothing specifically to talk about now. ","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Question on the gross margin, certainly when some of the preliminaries all started to come out from HDD companies with more of margins, there\u2019s a lot of concern in the market that there was an increase in pricing pressure. I know you commented that the decline at the WD was due to mix. ","I was actually wondering if you could just talk about pricing trend within some of the segments can you translate on a quarter-to-quarter basis (inaudible) some pricing increases on some of the categories and also you talked about in the past being sell products especially Helium products on a [CCO] basis. So any color you could provide on pricing within segments would be helpful.","Steve Milligan","So relative to what we saw, again our margin decline on a quarter-on-quarter basis was purely driven and mix related. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual from our perspective to call out on the pricing front. ","Operator","Our last question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","Just a moderate question, days inventory that has been elevated for three quarters on a year-over-year basis, are we expecting that to continue to be the case?","Olivier Leonetti","Yes, we are managing our cash flow tightly and we would expect the flow not to have been achieved. So we think we can improve further on this metric. ","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","And then this has been addressed to a certain extent, but I\u2019d like to try tease it out a little bit more. The $500 million of OpEx synergies with SanDisk, from my understanding there is three main bucket - I am sorry not OpEx synergies overall synergies. There are three main buckets from where this is going to come from PC express sales overlap, branded distribution, and interphase engineering. And if there\u2019s anything else I\u2019m missing please let me know, but can you rank order what you believe each of these are going to be in terms of magnitude.","Steve Milligan","Well the first thing is just to clarify we haven\u2019t called any of that out in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. I am not going to comment specifically on that. What we have said is that the lion share of that $500 million will be the benefit that we will get by being vertically integrated in our SSD business or existing SSD business.","And there will be some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that. And by the way the other thing is that we\u2019ve indicated the 500 million will be 18 months after the close of the transaction, which basically means that there will be further synergies beyond that 18 months period that we have to quantify publicly. ","Operator","We have one more question from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open. ","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","I want to go off on the same topic. So the 500 million in synergies it seems like you\u2019re describing Steve as these are benefits from owning the raw material in-house. So is that really a synergy I guess or is that just kind of recapturing the profit that SanDisk would have brought on otherwise. I guess my question is, when you add one plus one does it equal two plus 500 million, right if you could just clarify that one more time, I think it would help. ","Steve Milligan","Well it\u2019s exclusive of the benefits that we\u2019ll get from the existing SanDisk business. So its additive to whatever you might happen to estimate that the existing SanDisk business would be able to generate. So its additive. ","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","And then just be crystal clear, this includes no OpEx at all, no elimination of public company expenses that sort of thing, it\u2019s a very conservative number. ","Steve Milligan","I don\u2019t know if I used the word conservative, but it does include an estimate of some OpEx synergies. But we haven\u2019t quantified specifically what the OpEx versus the vertical integration benefits. We haven\u2019t quantified that difference. But we\u2019ve also indicated that we would expect that number to increase overtime beyond that 18 month period. ","Operator","At this time, we no longer have questions on queue. ","Steve Milligan","So thank you again for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution, and our customers for their continued business.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Bob Blair","Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning the impact of the Thailand flooding, including its impact on the industry demand in the next several quarters and the industry's ability to meet that demand, charges and expenses in the March quarter related to the Thailand flooding, flood mitigation measures in Thailand, our insurance coverage, demand for storage in the long-term, a return to pre-flood capacity levels by WD in the industry on our supply chain, our internal slider production in Thailand and Malaysia, industry inventory, diversification of our supply chain and its impact on cost and pricing, our investments and development, the expected completion of the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the timing and outcome of our motion to vacate the award entered against us in our arbitration with Seagate, our capital expenditure plans and our financial results expectations for the March quarter, including unit shipments, revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. ","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on October 28, 2011. ","We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. And you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.","In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call, excludes charges and expenses related to the Thailand flooding and our planned acquisition of HGST.

","In addition, we expect additional flood recovery expenses -- related expenses to be incurred in the March quarter, and it is possible that our fixed asset -- impairment estimates for the December quarter may have to be adjusted as the recovered assets are put into production.","Also as a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, but we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. ","[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.","I would now turn the call over to President and CEO, John Coyne.","John F. Coyne","Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. After my introductory remarks, Tim will provide an update on our operations and Wolfgang will review our Q2 financial performance and current outlook.","I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress in our mission to restore our manufacturing capacity in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand. This is reflected in our Q2 financial performance announced earlier today, the continued ramp of our Thai HDD production capacity and in the fact that we have now recommenced slider manufacturing, which had been suspended since October 10. ","While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress, thus far, is ahead of our original expectations and is attributable to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. I want to thank all of those involved in this huge and extraordinary effort.","We believe industry shipments in the December quarter were about 119 million units, which included approximately 11 million units of pre-flood inventory. Today, one quarter after the floods hit and despite the industry's heroic recovery efforts, supply remains significantly constrained. We believe this condition will persist throughout calendar 2012 with gradual improvement during the year, with industry production in the June quarter approaching pre-flood quarterly build levels. ","However, with the expected uptick in demand in the back half of the year, rollover demand from the current shortages and inventories throughout the supply chain at record lows, from component supply through HDD and system manufacturing and distribution and retail channels, we believe the pipeline will not be refilled to normal levels until the first half of calendar 2013. ","We believe demand for storage for the long term continues to grow unabated. With the HDD industries remarkable flood recovery effort and the gradual replenishment of the inventory pipeline, we believe rotating magnetic storage will weather its recent challenges and remain the preferred and most cost-effective solution to meet the demand for storage in high volume mass-market applications, with no significant loss of share to competing technologies as we remain focused on innovating and creating compelling value for customers.","From a WD standpoint, we expect our own recovery to  mirror the trajectory of the industry that I just outlined, with a return to pre-flood capacity levels in the quarter ending September and with our customers' inventory pipeline replenished in the first half of calendar 2013. ","This pace of recovery is important as we focus on satisfying our customers' needs and as we respond to their strong encouragement to resume our leading role in the industry. ","To that end, our priorities are clear for calendar 2012: First, we will continue to focus on restoring our manufacturing and supply-chain capacity to pre-flood levels; second, in concert with our supply partners, we are establishing the most robust and resilient supply chain of critical HDD components as we ramp our manufacturing capability back up; third, during the flood recovery period, we have maintained our focus and investment in development to ensure that we will be in a position to offer new products with advanced technology to sustain our leadership as we ramp our post-flood production. ","We plan to achieve these goals in the same time-tested focus on high-quality, low-cost and crisp execution that has established WD as a trusted leader in the storage industry over the last dozen years. We believe that executing to this strategy and achieving the aforementioned priorities will prove to be a compelling value proposition for our customers as we compete for their future business. ","Before turning the call over to Tim Leyden for a review of our operations and recovery effort, I want to comment on 2 additional matters: our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST and the pending litigation with Seagate. ","Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST by March of this year is on track, and we continue to work on obtaining the remaining approvals of the transaction from the respective government agencies. We remain very excited about the synergies of the acquisition and the advantages it will create for our customers.","On November 18, 2011, an arbitration award of $525 million was rendered against WD. Earlier today, the arbitrator awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $105 million. WD will promptly file a petition to vacate the award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and failed to consider relevant evidence. We anticipate that the court will hear our arguments on our petition in March or April of 2012, and issue a decision sometime thereafter. ","While we can provide no assurance that we will be successful, we believe that if the court reviewing our petition correctly considers the law, the arbitration award should be vacated. Tim?","Timothy M. Leyden","Thanks, John. In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as possible. ","With this overall objective in mind, we moved quickly to limit the disruption to our customers. We optimized our HDD availability through increased throughput from our Malaysian factory, increased the availability of external HGAs with assistance from SAE\/TDK. We engaged our previously idled island employees to recover many of the inundated fixed assets. And once the flooding had receded, we restarted production in our dried-out factories on a limited basis.","In addition to these operational initiatives, we took further action to remain profitable and minimize the impact on our working capital. Our team responded magnificently to these challenges, and I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress on the journey back to achieving full pre-flood capacity by the third calendar quarter of 2012.","Our focus now is on accelerating our recovery and increasing availability to our customers. At this point in time, we are not constrained relative to HDD assembly or test. We are still constrained by components availability, specifically sliders.","We are very pleased with the support we have been getting from SAE\/TDK in providing both completed HGAs and processing WD's raw wafers. Additionally, we are grateful for the expeditious recovery efforts of our mechanical and other suppliers, who themselves were affected by the Thailand floods.","As of yesterday, we have completed our first batch of post-flood sliders in our Bang Pa-in facility, and we are working through qualification and expect to have a meaningful quantity of internally produced sliders shipping in our HDD products by the end of the current quarter.","We are enhancing our infrastructure by extending slider production capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to mitigate risk. We expect to have Malaysian sliders shipping in our HDDs in the June quarter.","The Bang Pa-in and Navanakorn Industrial Park landlords and the Thailand government are planning to reinforce and install flood barriers for these industrial zones, and we intend to augment those with company-specific initiatives.","We are working with our suppliers to diversify their manufacturing locations in order to reduce geographical concentration. Supplier recovery is progressing well, and we expect that suppliers will be substantially back to pre-flood run rate levels by the June quarter.","We are maintaining the pace of product and technology development and though we have encountered challenges due to flooding, we are focused on minimizing the impact. We are currently shipping 1 terabyte per platter of 3.5-inch and 500 gigabytes per platter of 2.5-inch drives in volume. ","In accordance with our normal practice, the rate of deployment of those newer technologies is dependent on cost-crossover points at each capacity point. Additionally, I am pleased to report that we have our 900-gigabyte 2.5-inch SAS product in qualification at multiple OEMs.","As we emerge from the aftermath of the flooding, we are mindful of coming back with a more robust supply-chain model that seeks to disperse in-house and supplier risks across geographies and factory locations. ","This dispersion of volumes across a wider geographical area will contribute to some structural and logistical cost increases, which should be recovered from customers in order to maintain the continuing investment required in one of the high technology and capital intensive business.  And one anticipated benefit of our recovery activities is that we are taking advantage of the downtime to improve process efficiencies and cycle times.","Supply of HDD is constrained at an overall industry level due to supply-chain disruption. From WD's standpoint, we are allocating product to customers, segments and channels by attempting to maximize HDD availability through optimizing component utilization. We are taking current inventory positions where known into account as we respond to immediate customer needs, while at the same time, paying attention to the fundamentals of running a viable, profitable business, conserving cash and continuing to stay competitive technologically.","As a result of balancing all these factors, you will note that, broadly speaking, the percentages of volume supplies to market segments and channels is different to what might be perceived as our more normal supply profile.","In general, channels with shorter inventory pipelines are getting higher and more immediate product allocations, while channels with longer inventory pipelines are expected to deplete available inventory before receiving further product allocation. ","This methodology was and is being deployed with the intent to maximize the availability of HDD products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon.","As a result, we shipped 9.8 million netbook drives --notebook drives, 11.4 million desktops, 2.4 million CE, 3.2 million branded and 1.7 million enterprise units into the marketplace during the December quarter.","I will now comment on expected industry supply-demand conditions for the current quarter and the balance of calendar 2012. We expect demand to again significantly exceed supply during the March quarter and to add to the net supply deficit that occurred during the December quarter. We estimate that supply in the March quarter will be back-end loaded, as components' availability improve, and that there will be further depletion of inventory in each of the segments and channels, leading to better clarity around supply-demand positions as the quarter unfolds. WD's HDD production will continue to be constrained by component availability.","In contrast to the December quarter, where inventory buffers in all sectors of the supply chain, somewhat mitigated the HDD shortage as evidenced by the PC OEM units being only modestly down from expected volumes. Most of that excess inventory has now been extracted, and inventory levels are extremely low. ","These depleted inventory levels, coupled with any rolled over demand as a result of the December and March quarters supply deficits mentioned above, the additional prospects of the increasing seasonal demand in the back half of the year and the value proposition from the emerging ultrabook and Windows 8 introductions will mean that the HDD supply will struggle to match demand through calendar year 2012.  Consequently, we do not expect meaningful inventory replenishment until the first half of 2013. ","In WD's case, we are targeting throughput to approach 60%, 80% and 100% of pre-flood production volumes in the March, June and September quarters, respectively.","I'll now turn the call over to Wolfgang for commentary on fiscal Q2 and our forecast for fiscal Q3 2012.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance the last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the March quarter.","For the December quarter, revenue was $2 billion, down 19% from the prior year and 26% from the September quarter. We shipped a total of 28.5 million hard drives as compared to 52.2 million and 57.8 million for the year ago and the September quarters, respectively. In excess of 3 million units that we shipped to customers during the December quarter were manufactured in the prior quarter.","Average selling price was approximately $69 per unit, up $22 from the year ago quarter and up $23 from the September quarter. There were 2 customers, which each comprised 10% or more of our total revenue: Acer and Dell. ","OEM sales represented 59% of revenue, up from 45% in the prior year and 53% in the September quarter. Distribution channel sales represented 25% of revenue, down from 33% in the prior year and 29% in the September quarter. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 16%, down from prior year's 22% and September's 18%. ","Revenue from sales of our branded products was $328 million, down 40% from the year ago quarter and 33% from the September quarter. As Tim mentioned earlier, we deliberately allocated production output by balancing immediate customer needs with prevailing inventory positions.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, up from 19.2% in the year ago quarter and 20.1% in the September quarter. The increase in gross margin is a result of higher ASPs, partially offset by higher cost per unit.","On average, per unit costs were approximately $10 higher than in the September quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and a higher cost for other components as a result of the flood impact on ourselves and our supply-chain partners.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $287 million in the December quarter as compared to $235 million and $282 million in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. ","SG&A included $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the December quarter and a total of $18 million in acquisition and unrelated litigation accruals in the September quarter. ","Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $276 million, $235 million and $264 million in the December, year ago and September quarters, respectively. The increase in total R&D and SG&A is due to higher spending on development and marketing of new products, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas and higher incentive accruals.","Expenses for the December quarter also included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand floods. These costs consist of $109 million of fixed asset impairments and $90 million for damaged inventory, recovery and remediation services and wage continuation. This does not include any offset of potential insurance recoveries.","The company, as we have previously stated, carries property and business interruption insurance. Discussions with our insurance carriers are moving forward, but the claim process is still in its early stages.","Net interest and other non-operating expense was $2 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business.  Net expense for the December quarter was $15 million or 9.4% of pretax income. ","Our net income for the December quarter totaled $145 million or $0.61 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share for the year ago quarter and $239 million or $1.01 per share in the September quarter. ","The December quarter included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood and $14 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees. Whereas the September quarter included the combined $21 million for acquisition-related expenses, bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals. ","Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the December quarter totaled $358 million or $1.51 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter and $260 million or $1.10 per share in the September quarter.","As John indicated in his remarks regarding the arbitration award, we intend to promptly file a petition to vacate. We believe that if the court correctly considers the law, the award should be vacated. As a result, we have not made an accrual for the award in the December quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the December quarter was a positive 5 days. This consisted of 34 days of receivables, 31 days of inventory or 12 turns and 60 days of payables. Once we realized the extent to which our production was impacted, as well as the impact to our key suppliers, we shortened payment terms with our customers and directed more cash to our strategic component and equipment supply partners in order to stabilize the supply chain and support a quick recovery.  I would note that we did not accept prepayments from our customers, and prepayments to suppliers were not material. ","We generated $378 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $258 million. ","Capital spending for the December quarter totaled $120 million. December quarter disbursements were for assets that were ordered prior to the flood. ","Depreciation and amortization expense for the December quarter totaled $140 million. ","Recovery capital received during the December quarter was not significant as the lead time for such items is several months.  March quarter capital spending will include a significant amount of replacement capital. The total amount of capital spending we will incur during calendar of 2012 to restore our capacity to pre-flood levels and increase the robustness of our supply chain is approximately $650 million. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be between $750 million and $800 million inclusive of recovery capital. This was accomplished by reallocating much of our original capacity capital to recovery capital.","Capital spending for technology-related assets continues as originally planned. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the December quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $231 million. ","We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, an increase of $249 million from the September quarter. Approximately $3.2 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore.","Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the March quarter. Despite the heroic efforts of our employees and suppliers resulting in the recommencement of operations in both drive and slider factories, our March quarter output will be significantly constrained and we expect to ship between 31 million and 33 million drives.","Total demand for the quarter is expected to significantly exceed industry supply capability. We expect that our pricing will continue to be significantly above pre-flood levels due to the supply-constrained environment, under-absorption of our manufacturing assets and higher component costs. Average costs will not improve significantly quarter-over-quarter. While we have greater output and therefore less impact from fixed cost absorption, we do not have the benefit of mixing in pre-flood lower-cost inventory. ","With respect to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in growth areas, such as our Enterprise, SSD and Branded Products businesses. ","Our March guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses or charges and expenses related to the flood. In relation to expenses related to our flood recovery efforts, we expect to incur about $50 million, consisting primarily of ongoing reclaim and recovery work and wage continuation for idled workers.","With these sectors in mind, our March quarter guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion; R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $275 million, excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our 6% to 9% business model; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 239 million; accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses. ","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, maybe just a little bit of clarification on the expectations for getting back to 100% of your potential capacity to pre-flood levels. Around when in the June quarter do you think that happens? And what are your assumptions around sort of some of the supply chain and the ability of the supply chain to ramp up to where you need it to for that quarter?","John F. Coyne","Okay, Scott, actually we indicated that we would be back to pre-flood capacity in the September quarter. And we believe that the suppliers and the supply chain will be back to pre-flood capacity during the June quarter.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so then the 100% that you're talking about for the September quarter, you expect to hit 100% sometime in the September quarter? Or wouldn't you have to hit that in the June quarter to be able to hit 100% in the September quarter?","John F. Coyne","Yes. I mean it's splitting hairs really, but we will be -- we think -- we expect to be at 100% of capacity in the September quarter. So yes, exiting the June quarter, we'll have to be getting to that run rate.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one other follow-up. On the ASP side of things for the quarter, Wolfgang, you guys just reported, can you maybe talk about like-for-like pricing versus the mix and sort of what the influences on both of those were?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. A couple of things to consider. First of all, the pre-flood ASPs for the units that we shipped was obviously lower than what we shipped from week 4 to week 13. There was some moderate mix down, probably 8% to 10% in the ASP. And if you take that into consideration, the ASP included in our guidance is down from the Q2 level. If you use the numbers we've provided, it's somewhere in the $64 to $65 area, and that's the result of us aligning pricing between channels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to the recovery discussion. You guys earlier in the call had made a comment about 60% return to pre-flood levels of production. Just math would assume that, that's closer to about 40 million drives versus your guidance of 31 million to 33 million, which would be about 50% recovery. I'm just trying to understand what the difference is between those?","Timothy M. Leyden","Actually 60% of pre-flood recovery comes out at around 35 million units.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, so you guys shipped about 58 million units pre-flood. You are running above your capacity level for normalized production capacity at that point?","Timothy M. Leyden","That's the pre-flood capacity that we were referring to is 58 million units, and 60% of 58 million units is 34.8 million.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just an update -- I know you're not talking about post-acquisition dynamics, but can you remind us what kind of balance sheet -- what kind of cash position you expect to have post the Hitachi deal as it stands today?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I can't do that. Like we said, we have an ending cash balance of about $3.9 billion. We have arranged a term loan of $2.5 billion and an additional revolver available to us of $500 million. We will take out the current debt we have on the balance sheet, the $231 million. And then the cash that we'll transfer to Hitachi is just short of $3.5 billion. So with that in mind, we'll have a very solid cash balance after we consume the acquisition.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So to be clear, you'll be net positive or net cash position post-deal?","John F. Coyne","That's a good assumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about a gradual improvement in supply-demand over the next 3 quarters. Does the drop in pricing trend on a linear basis with that supply improvement? Or are there other dynamics as it relates to either volatility in channel pricing or long-term supply agreements that suggests that pricing will look different than the supply improvements?","John F. Coyne","I think the fundamental difference in a post-flood recovered era versus pre-flood is that we will have created a more robust and more geographically dispersed supply chain, which will have some intrinsic cost increases relative to pre-flood footprint. Additionally, in getting back the capacity wiped out by the floods, there's been significant incremental spending by ourselves and by our supply chain and by the industry supply chain in general. And so we expect that, that incremental investment will be reflected in the costs that are carried forward into the future. So we think that while there will be a gradual reduction of the pricing that's being driven by the imbalance between supply and demand in a stabilized situation where inventories have been rebuilt throughout the chain to normal levels, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2013 calendar year. That when prices stabilize in that environment, we expect they will be at a higher level than pre-flood due to the incremental costs that I just outlined.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is it a moderate difference? A 5% to 10% price difference versus pre-flood or could it be more than that?","John F. Coyne","No, I think it's a moderate difference.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly to change the topic, away from Thailand. Just curious what your view is on ultrabooks. Do you agree with Intel's view that 40% of consumer notebooks in a year or so could be ultrabooks? And what type of storage medium would you expect that form factor to have?","John F. Coyne","I expect ultrabooks to have both hard drives, traditional hard drives and hybrid hard drives and SSDs. So I think there will be, depending on the specific version of ultrabook, you will see all 3 solutions and even in certain models, choices between those solutions in the same model. And we think that the SSD penetration profile will be in very low single digits in a mature ultrabook environment. And then we see an emerging position for hybrids a little early to develop a view on exactly what percentage of penetration, but we see hybrids as a very compelling alternative on the performance side to solid state on bang for the buck. And we anticipate that in large capacity environments, traditional hard drives will continue to be the compelling solution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Technology Insights Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Could you talk about the logic behind the implied ASP plans being down only 6% Q-on-Q? In terms of what you expect the channel to OEM mix to be, it looks like the channel pricing is already exhibiting some pricing elasticity as supply comes back online here.","John F. Coyne","Yes. I mean I just can repeat what we said earlier. We had a $69 ASP in the December quarter, which included pre-flood pricing that was significantly lower than that. So you can expect that our post-flood pricing was in the 70s, and we'll be guiding to a revenue guidance that includes somewhere in the $64 to $65 range, and that includes some adjustments between the channels.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Okay. And then also can you give any guidance on what you expect the disc-to-drive ratio trajectory to be as you get to this full gigabyte recovery into 1H '13? When does that disc-to-drive ratio bottom? Is it in the March quarter? Or will it be in the June quarter?","Timothy M. Leyden","We actually had experienced a reduction during the course of the December quarter. We expect that it will be a further slight reduction in the March quarter and then, it will start to improve in the June quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Considering the shortages this year of HDDs and the need to refill inventory in the channel, in terms of your capacity planning, are you planning on increasing your manufacturing capacity beyond what it was in 2011?","Timothy M. Leyden","As we have indicated, our targets that we have stated of 60%, 80% and 100% in the March, June and September quarters, that is a throughput number. And that's the indication of the capacity that we are planning in that period of time.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess to me that suggests that you're not planning on increasing capacity above what it was at pre-flood levels.","John F. Coyne","I think we want to take a look at, as the market builds back and gets close to a balance between supply and demand, we will be able to get a closer look at true demand, true end-market demand unconstrained by supply. And then as we have done for years, we'll make appropriate decisions on capacity expansion based on the market demand as we perceive it at that time, recognize that we can typically offer a stable base. We can add capacity at a pretty rapid lick should we judge that the market requires it.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the pricing to the OEMs,  I know some of your competitors have talked about long-term agreements that they put in place with the OEMs, have you talked to the OEMs and put in place any long-term pricing agreements?","John F. Coyne","We've been extremely encouraged by the level of support from our OEMs, and indeed from our broader customer base. But in particular, our major OEMs have been extremely supportive of WD through these challenges, continue to press us to return to pre-flood capabilities as soon as possible. The award of business, the award of share is something that you execute every day in order to earn from your customers. We have consistently done that over the last 12 years. We will work to store our capacity and continue to work at delighting our customers and presenting them with an exceptional value they can get nowhere else in the industry. And I can't say enough to thank our customers for their support and encouragement as we build back our capability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. Can you talk about the average capacity drive shipped in the quarter versus the September quarter and what you think you might be able to do in March?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I think I mentioned earlier, Rich, we mixed down about 8% to 10% from September to December. And what Tim just indicated, there might be a slight mix down in the March quarter before we see the capacity of the drive going up again.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the cash award or the judgment award that you're fighting against Seagate, should it go awry and you have to actually pay that, would that have to come out of U.S. cash? Or would you be able to use your offshore cash since Seagate is an Irish company?","John F. Coyne","Well another little piece of information, I mentioned as I referred to our petition to vacate that arbitration award, I said we would file it promptly. I can confirm that we have filed the petition since the start of this call. And we believe that the -- when that goes to court, as the court reviews that and considers the law, that the arbitration award will be vacated on that basis. We have made no accrual for that award in the current accounts. So that -- I guess you have -- paying is in our belief does not arise. We can't assure you of success, but that's our position today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Just like to get your feeling about the general, we've talked about pricing, but do you see distribution pricing falling since that went up significantly more that what I understand was the OEM price increases? Do you see that falling more quickly than the OEM pricing? Or will they fall relatively in a linear fashion?","Timothy M. Leyden","Well as we've indicated, the number -- the pricing number that we had in December was, it came out at $68, $69. And we have forecast, that it would come down slightly during the course of the current quarter, and that's more of an alignment by channel. And so we have taken that into account. And as John indicated earlier on, we are -- it's more a question of aligning supply with demand and also of satisfying the needs of our customers. So consequently, there will be a cost increase, as John also indicated, and that cost will be reflected in the pricing once things settle down. But at the moment, there's a pretty significant deficit between supply and demand, and we're taking that into account as best we can, make the assumptions at this point in time, and that's we're reflecting.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I believed that you indicated that during the quarter, there were more heads, and that was one of the reasons that cost went up on externally. Was that driven by the shipping of these higher capacity products, areal density products?","John F. Coyne","No. The -- one of the things that we've indicated for many years in maintaining our strategy of sourcing heads internally and a significant proportion externally was the management of risk. And as we saw in the floods where we were dependent for slider fab of internal to a very significant extent in that one facility at Bang Pa-in, our long-standing relationship and strategic decision to have a significant external source now stands us in very good stead. As we ramp that external source to support us while we bridge to bring back up capacity in our own facilities so that we can ramp demand back up to full production. So the -- basically, we've indicated that we allocated those available heads both internal and external to a mix of product, which was about 8% to 10% mix down in the December quarter versus September quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JPMC.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question, if I could. Sorry if it's been asked already. In terms of the March outlook, I heard your estimates in terms of the WD units, but can you talked about what the industry shipments could be now that the pre-flood inventory buffer is no longer present?","John F. Coyne","We don't really know yet. Seagate gave some indication of their expectations for March capacity. We've just given an indication. We don't yet understand what Hitachi and Toshiba may be capable of, given their progress with supply-chain rebuild, et cetera. So what we do know is that there's going to be a significant shortage between the supply capability of the industry and its supply base and the demand pattern in the quarter, which comes on top of now a defined shortfall last quarter if we accept that the true TAM, the true demand was in the 175 million to 180 million range, and we know the industry shipped 119 million. So there's 50 million units shortfall there and another 11 million that was squeezed out of the overall supply chain by our estimation. We think there'll be some -- some of the small amount of remaining inventory will be squeezed out of the March supply line, as well as whatever the industry manages to ship in. But in any event, there's going to be a significant shortage gap between those 2 numbers.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you think that gap kind of stays the same? Or does it get actually worse now this quarter...","John F. Coyne","I don't think it gets worse.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then my other question, John or Tim or Wolfgang, whoever wants to take it, as you guys contemplate this return back to 100% to pre-flood levels sometime during the summertime, can you give us a sense in terms of how much of your internal sourcing composition will change in terms of what was external versus internally sourced prior to the flood versus how it will look after you're back to 100% post-flood?","John F. Coyne","I think we've consistently targeted that percentage to be about 20% with a range around that. But depending on circumstances, it goes plus, minus 5% to 10%, right? So the -- and that model is going to continue into the long-term future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gentlemen, you mentioned that you're still confident that the merger with HGST will close by March. Would you mind just kind of discussing a little more about you -- why you have that confidence still? There's just been questions around China MOFCOM support, as well as how the sale is going from the EU conditions. So any details around that will be helpful.","John F. Coyne","Well we have several full approvals, we have several conditional approvals, conditional approvals from EU, Japan and Korea, and we continue to work with the FTC in the U.S. and with China to gain approval there. And we believe that we will be in a position to meet the conditions of the approvals granted by the authorities that have granted conditional approvals so far. And we believe that we will achieve approvals from the -- to China and the U.S. before March.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And my follow-up is with regard to slider production. I'm sorry if you said this, but have you -- are you ramping efforts outside of Thailand as a contingency? And is there any time line on that? Or do you think you're going to stay in Thailand with the slider production predominantly? I'm sorry if you answered that and said it.","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes, in my prepared remarks, I addressed that. I indicated that we are extending capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to spread that risk.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are you doing that already or you didn't say?","Timothy M. Leyden","Sorry I didn't get...","John F. Coyne","In heads produced from the new Malaysia slider fab will be in drives in the June quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on long-term agreements. Do you have a sense how the LTAs that Seagate has signed will impact your business, if at all, this year, calendar '12?","John F. Coyne","We don't have insight into the terms of any Seagate LTAs. We believe that customer share is earned day by day with execution on value. We're focused on that, working with our customers to rapidly recover our position as soon as we can. The current conversations with our customers indicate that they are very desirous of that situation. And our problem is not agreements, our problem is internal execution to be able to satisfy our customer needs, and we're focused on improving our execution and building our capacity to supply our customers.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Would you want LTAs to be status quo for the industry post Thailand issue?","John F. Coyne","Well I mean we've had LTAs with multiple customers for many, many years. They generally provide an outline under -- of the terms and conditions, under which we will work with our customers. And indeed, we have LTAs with certain suppliers. And they provide a framework within which we execute. And the extent to which we execute effectively typically influences the overall level and profitability of the business we do.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Last question for me. You talked about capacity coming on back online as the year unfolds. Could you talk about certain drive types? It's our understanding that there's more constraints in the near-line enterprise market specifically.","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes, the near-line market was down quite a bit in the last quarter, significantly constrained, we would say supply-wise  because there was some bleeding of inventory as well.  It went down from 6.8 million to 5.3 million, I believe. So that continues to be short. There is a lot of demand, cloud-related demand in that market. And we continue to service as much of it as we can, and we'll continue to do so.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just following up on that. Could you maybe provide a little bit more color around how close should be the matching the mix demand when you get out to 100% capacity? You talked in total units, but I was curious if -- when you actually think your mix will be back to levels pre-flood?","Timothy M. Leyden","As we get back to full production capacity, we expect to be able to match the mix exiting the June quarter.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","And then just lastly on the gross margins. Given some of the direction you've given around pricing and mix as well, where would you anticipate gross margins trending over next few quarters relative to your long-term targets? And what would we be looking for, say, a year from now?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","In the next quarter, if you do take the numbers that we've provided, you can impute that, and you'll see that somewhere in the 29% to 30% range. A little bit early to talk beyond that time frame as we recover, and we're not changing our long-term business model right now. We're going to wait until we close the acquisition and until we're back to pre-flood capacity, and I will give you an update on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cindy Shell [ph] with Lazerne [ph].","Unknown Analyst","A couple of questions. One, there's been some talk from -- I know your supplier requires about -- the capacity that's being restored going up straight to the next basically areal density, and I was wondering is that -- as you restore capacity, the plan and what are the risks you see around that?","John F. Coyne","Well I think, Cindy, Tim already indicated that the way we had traditionally managed our business and the way we'll continue to manage the business is that we manage transitions on areal density based on the needs of each specific market capacity point and the cost profile, cost crossover profiles between old and new ways of satisfying that capacity point. It's an area that WD has historically excelled at relative to results in the rest of the market, and we will continue to manage our business that way.","Unknown Analyst","And then there have been some comments about margins within my industry contacts, really, saying they think that the margins, gross margins, really resettle at a much higher level than we've seen over the past few years. It sounds from your last -- the answer to the last question that you're not knowing to drive a stake in the ground, but if you are, I'd be curious as to your thoughts on that?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes. Like in the previous answer, we're not going to provide any forecast beyond the March quarter.","John F. Coyne","Well thank you, all, for joining us today and for your continued interest in WD. I want to again acknowledge the heroic effort by our employees and our supply partners in helping us achieve the progress we have thus far and to assure our customers and shareholders that we're working hard to return the company to its leadership position. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you. Well, I want to mention at the outset we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the June quarter and calendar year 2013, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance including our financial results expectations for the June quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures that we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly factsheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and other charges. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks by our CEO and CFO from today's call will be available on the Investor section of the Western Digital website immediately following the conclusion of our call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our March quarter results and outlook for the June quarter.","I am pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. We continue to execute well and capitalize on the ongoing secular growth in digital data. Industry demand was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the June quarter to be flat to slightly down with the March quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the potential for a modest seasonal uptick in demand for the second half of calendar 2013. Our production levels will continue to be adjusted to prevailing demand patterns.","In the March quarter, both the HGST and WD subsidiaries continued to deliver outstanding financial results, driving gross margin performance well within our model. We continue to effectively manage the diverse elements of our business with a keen focus on operational excellence and value creation for our customers, shareholders and employees. Customers continue to respond favorably to our breadth of product offerings and value-based engagement model. It is important to note that we have established a leadership position in the fastest growing areas of the storage industry. These include our high-capacity drives and solid state drives for the cloud, branded product solutions for the personal cloud and leading, small form factor drives for thin and light mobile devices. Given our strong pipeline of innovative new products, we have the opportunity to sustain this favorable momentum for the foreseeable future. Currently, we are seeing strong market response to several new products, including our new family of 5-millimeter, 2.5-inch hard drives and solid state hybrid drives for ultraportable devices; our 7-disk, helium sealed drive platform aimed at delivering significant total cost of ownership benefits for hyperscale data centers and our expanding range of SSD offerings for the enterprise space.","We continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for storage and our increasingly strategic position within this vast digital data ecosystem. Western Digital is one of the best positioned technology companies to leverage the ongoing creation, transfer and storage of data, a trend linked directly to consumers' increasingly ubiquitous experience with data in all aspects of their lives. We believe digital data growth will continue unabated for the foreseeable future with total exabyte shift growing from 600 exabytes in 2012 to at least 5,900 exabytes by 2020, representing a 33% compounded annual growth rate.","Consistent with other recent commentary, we believe exabyte growth is a better and more relevant measure of the growth potential for the industry and our company. Western Digital is a market- and customer-driven company focused on growth and innovation. We develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers, an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market-maker. We believe this approach will continue to be one of the key factors in helping us to achieve strong business performance. The Western Digital platform is powerful with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our value-creation model within the storage ecosystem. I am confident that this approach will continue to result in strong and sustainable financial performance, further differentiating Western Digital as one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize the total market demand and our consolidated financial performance for the March quarter, and then conclude with a range of our expected financial results for the June quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are very pleased with our March quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model. The HDD market shipped approximately 135 million units during the March quarter, flat to the December quarter and in line with our forecasted range in late January. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded product. Our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers are also in good shape. Our revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. We shipped a total of 60.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business and product mix, and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines.","The average capacity per drive we shipped in the March quarter was 810 gigabytes, a 35% year-over-year increase. This reflects strengths in our branded and enterprise businesses as well as solid mix-up in our client business to cope with the ever-increasing amount of digital content. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.2%, excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 120 basis points better than our guidance as a result of better-than-expected cost improvements and product mix, and lower-than-anticipated price declines. A broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, the revenue contribution of our non-PC related business has grown from 35% in fiscal year '08 and is projected to account for more than 50% of our revenue in fiscal year '13. As a reminder, our monthly fee-related business is comprised of our branded products, consumer electronics and enterprise business, which includes SSDs.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $581 million for the March quarter. SG&A included $22 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred additional charges of $63 million from the March quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we had already incurred total charges of $147 million in the prior 3 quarters, reflecting ongoing infrastructure alignment as well as an evolution of our organization to address growth opportunities.","Tax expense for the March quarter was $15 million or 4% of pretax income. The rate reflects the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $391 million or $1.60 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million or $2.10 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $727 million in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $539 million. Our CapEx for the March quarter totaled $188 million. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be at the upper end of our CapEx model, including approximately $200 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would be close to the bottom end of our model range, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in today's environment. Out of our capital allocation strategy, we have repurchased 5.2 million shares for $243 million during the March quarter. In addition, we declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60 million, which we paid on April 15 to shareholders of record as of March 29. We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S.","I'll now provide our guidance for the June quarter, which anticipates sustained strong performance within our business model during what is typically the industry's softest quarter. We expect a flat-to-slightly down total available market when compared with the March quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion, reflecting the current demand and pricing environment and the seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin, well within our model at approximately 28.5%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect tax rates within our 7% to 10% model and the share count of approximately 243 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.80 for the June quarter.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] and how it impacts your business. I'm sure you've all seen that PC units were down substantially in the March quarter, but if we look at your PC business based on the desktop and the notebook, you were up a little bit. Now I know that those businesses are not exactly correlated, but I think some people are concerned there are some inventory building somewhere in the channel that would describe that difference between what you were seeing and what the PC market is seeing. Can you give us some more detail on why there would be a difference there?","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. This is Steve. I mean, one of the things that I think that we have to continue to keep in mind, I mean Wolfgang alluded to it in his prepared remarks, is that we're becoming -- first thing is we're becoming less and less of a PC story and more of an overall digital data growth story. So although we are still impacted by what's happening in the PC market, it's becoming less and less. That being said, yes, the PC market was down. It was only down a bit more than what we actually had forecasted, so our underlying assumptions did not expect there to be particular strength in the PC business. So we were not that surprised on the downside in terms of what happened there, and the fact that our units are up was really more a reflection of our ability to gain a bit of share from an execution standpoint. And then lastly, as Wolfgang indicated, we do not believe at present that there isn't any sort of an inventory issue in terms of the PC market that we're aware of.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to get a little more detail on the near-line market. How large do you think that market was? What do you think your share was in that market? And what type of growth expectations do you have for that going forward?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, Sherri, that market grew healthy quarter-over-quarter. We believe it was up from 7.5 to like 8.5, 8.4, 8.5, just like a solid increase quarter-over-quarter. Our share there is very solid. Our share is very well distributed across all of our businesses.  Our average share outlook is 44.4, and I'd say our market's up plus minus 2% in that range. And we said before that it's one of the markets that we believe will show solid growth in the future, and we previously said that we expect double-digit growth in those markets. And that's volume and on top of that, significantly more data growth in that market in particular.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to dive a little deeper into one of your comments on the gross margin side. There were some cost savings and, I guess, unanticipated or accelerated cost savings. Was any of that head related or the transition to new aerial density benefiting, or if you can just elaborate a little bit more on those elements?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, Rich, the team's executed very well. We have extremely good linearity, which helped us earn a bit more market share, for the volume was slightly higher than we thought. That helps with the overall absorption. We're not done with the aerial density transition, but we made solid progress. And lastly, I think with our suppliers, and we are now what we would call in a more normal area in terms of internal external sourcing. So all of these things paired with solid execution on -- in both of our subs helped us to -- has better cost than one we thought.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Quatrochi for Aaron. I was wondering if you could comment maybe on your days payable kind of increasing because the -- your CCC to increase to 12 days. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of how to model that going forward.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, our cash conversion cycle target model is 4 to 8 days. We're a tad over that. It's less a function of the days payable. We like that in that range that we displayed. We have made very conscious investments in inventory. As you know, we're restructuring quite a bit in various operations. And when you do that, you want to make sure that you're sufficient, both for materials and plays. We also make sure that we take advantage on where we understand the demand signals very well of ocean shipments; that's quite a cost saving. And then lastly, and particular, our enterprise customers, we want to make sure that we have solid just-in-time warehouse inventory in front of them so that they -- so we don't disrupt their pools as they conduct their business. So midterm opportunity there, I would say more on the inventory turns. But we watch this thing very, very closely. But with the free cash flow of $539 million, we didn't make this one of our top priorities but it's an opportunity going forward.","Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I was wondering if you could comment a little further on OpEx. It looks like it was up sequentially in the quarter, yet headcount was down. I was wondering if -- when we might see an impact from the decrease in headcount going forward.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","First of all, just approaching the 581 to the 540 that we have in our guidance, first of all, the 540 was a non-GAAP measure. So there's about just shy of $20 million on incremental accruals on incentive plans since we overachieved. There is a $10 million or so standard amortization of intangibles that's there every quarter, and then we had a legal settlement there as well. So normalized for incentive payouts, we were pretty much exactly right on with our guidance. In terms of looking forward, we have a reduction of headcount that's mainly in the factories, which you would see the COGS line. But we're also reducing headcount in the OpEx areas but not to bring the overall OpEx down, it's to create room to invest in the growth areas. So we're investing in enterprise, in new platforms and we're investing in SSD and other areas. So the target of the restructuring there is -- let's reduce the number for now from the 550-ish kind of level. It's more to make room for the growth and strategic growth areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I guess this is for either Steve or Wolfgang. Why would gross margins be down in the June quarter off of March if pricing is -- sounds like you're saying pricing is a little better than you expected, and it feels like, just based on the margins you reported this quarter, that the mix is probably leaning at least as good, if not better than you expected. Would just love to get your thoughts on the gross margin dynamics in June.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I'll give you like the -- some of the drivers. First of all, volume, we said the market is slight to slightly down. So we anticipate that our volume will be down and that doesn't help with cost. But the main driver here is it's seasonally the softest quarter, but it's also seasonally a quarter where we have interesting channel mix dynamic going on. You're shipping more to OEMs, you're shipping less to retail, and in particular, desktop distribution channel is down in this quarter. So it's mainly a function of reduced volumes and business mix. And then we've modeled some price decline for the quarter as well.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. And that's helpful, Wolfgang. Can you -- you guys mentioned -- Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, I guess, of good adoption of new products. And I know you guys have -- you have the hybrid drives that are out, saw your 5-millimeter announcement, so new enterprise products are coming out and you have the single product drives. Can you give us a sense -- or actually, some drives and some new game stations as we go through the year that I think are actually higher cap. Can you give us some sense of how we should expect the mix to manifest itself on the business as we move through the year? And what -- yes, I know you're not going to be able to give guidance on the gross margin, but it seems like you have really nice mix up. And so any help sort of on how we should think about all those factors manifesting in results would be helpful as we go through the year.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, so I'll comment on that. We continue to expect our mix to improve. I mean, it's a little bit when I -- I'll talk a little bit about a longer term view. There's always seasonal things that happen quarter-to-quarter, but the mix trends are very favorable from our perspective and it comes back to the fact that digital data growth continues to be very substantial. And people need to store that data somewhere and they need more storage as opposed to less storage. And so we're going to continue to benefit from that. And as we mix up, that is -- that provides better economics for us. And so the longer term, if you want to refer to it as secular trend, is favorable from that perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First, Wolfgang, can you take us through the sort of free cash flow usages as you see it for the rest of the year? You talked a bit about CapEx, but maybe where that's going to be spent outside of the $200 million on the Thai-related issues, and then as well as buyback and stuff like that? And then secondly, maybe a question for Steve. Can you discuss the investment in Skyera and just sort of your thought process behind that and maybe why not a PCIe guy? Why on flash? Just sort of kind of take us through your thought process there.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, on the free cash flow, it's really straightforward. I think we had 3 quarters and well above 500. We expect another solid quarter. I think the linearity is going to be okay. We've guided to a CapEx number that would let you conclude that we have somewhat lower than what we spend in Q3 in CapEx. That CapEx now is mainly really focused on technology development, robustness of the supply chain, and then as we mix up in test capacity as well. In terms of what we do after the free cash flow, we stick to the 50% capital allocation strategy to shareholders as a percent of free cash flow. I think we're just a little bit shy of that, and the intention would be to catch up by the end of the fiscal year.","Stephen D. Milligan","And in terms of Skyera, just to comment on that, Skyera is a small company based in San Jose that is privately held, focused on SSD array technology. We have been involved with Skyera for a while, both in terms of an initial equity investor as well as we worked with them on a number of different technical areas. And we had the opportunity to participate in their latest equity round, and we're glad to do that. We've got a lot of interesting technology and we're -- not only from an equity perspective, but also just from a technical collaboration perspective. Very pleased to be working with them. In terms of your comment why Skyera versus something else, I don't think that it's an either or. We're very interested in the broader solid state memory area, particularly in the enterprise area, and that includes things that we're doing in terms of our existing enterprise SSD business, also in terms of what companies like Skyera is doing, and also in terms of PCIe. And so this just happens to be one equity investment that we were able to make in the past 90 days.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the TAM as you see it this year after -- you specifically identified that the TAM in the June quarter would be flat to down a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about sequential growth or second half growth and any more specificity? And more broadly, just want to hear some thoughts on if the PC market -- most consensus, I think, are now down 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% in terms of units. But if the PC market is down 7%, 8% for the next couple of years, what do you think the TAM growth would be for the HDD business against that type of backdrop?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Well, I'll start it off, Keith. So our own assumptions, I think Steve said in his remarks, is a modest seasonal uptick in the second half. And the emphasis on seasonal, I mean, that's purely driven by back-to-school, holidays. And one of the products Steve has talked about, the gaming business that's strong in the second half as well. So you want me to put a number around it, it's somewhere around 140-ish or so. So I think that's a prudent planning assumption. In terms of the PC growth...","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry, 140 for the kind of the September quarter, I assume you mean?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, September and December. And then I think Steve said it that, yes, I see and Gartner has posted, I believe, 11% and 13% decline in the first quarter for the PC market. That was not too far off what we had modeled in our assumptions. I think we wouldn't disagree with like an assumption of like 5% or so year-over-year decline of that market. IDC and Gartner forecast the market then to resume, like, modest growth. I think we would agree with that. And we continue to believe that our market, from a volume perspective, is increasing from this year on by like 3%. And that's really driven by capacity, enterprise and branded. And we quoted the numbers on our PC and our non-PC related business, and we continue to see that trend to go to non-PC related businesses.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. So philosophically, if the market's down 5% to 7% on a sustained basis, you think you can have positive unit growth even against that PC backdrop?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes.","Stephen D. Milligan","If we go back, Keith, I mean I think that there's a couple key points to emphasize. I mean, one, we are not anticipating a meaningful change in terms of what's happening in the PC market. We're not counting on that. We're being very cautious with regards to our production plans in that regard. The other thing is that we talked about, at our Investor Day, was a longer-term unit growth rate in terms of HDDs of 3%. That continues to be our current assumption, but that growth is not coming from PCs. It's coming from other areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. I mean, one, you guys are guiding for a flattish TAM in the June quarter, flat down. But I think your sales sort of implies sales will be down somewhere in the 4.5% range. Can you talk about how much of that is pricing-driven versus potentially, you give up some of the share gains you had in the March quarter as you go through June?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Amit, the first impact is really from a segment mix, like, for instance, the pricing in our branded products is significantly higher than if we ship into a gaming solution, for instance. And so that's a big driver. If you look for like-for-like pricing, I mean, we have modeled modest declines there. And share is not really something that we plan for, that's more like an outcome. We plan to have really good product and deliver it in a very linear fashion to the market, and the share is what the share is.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then if I look at just the enterprise side, it actually looks like you guys picked up a decent amount of share in the March quarter. When you think about it, I mean, do you think that was more a reflection of just the right customers you're partnered with or some of the newer technologies that you're talking of that has started to take more adoption, and that potentially could accelerate, I would imagine, as you get through the year?","Stephen D. Milligan","I don't know if I would draw any significant conclusions one way or the other in terms of the share. We did pick up a little bit of share in enterprise. Now if you go back, we had lost a little bit of share. So there are share gains and losses that occurred quarter-to-quarter occasionally within rough moderate ranges. And so I don't think that I would point to anything significantly per se other than the fact that, a longer-term thing, we continue to provide compelling products to our customers and we engage with them in a way that they want to buy more of our product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","A couple of questions for you. One, there's been a lot of hopes within some in the industry about a pickup in the second half due to things like the Windows XP end-of-life April next year, Ultrabooks for some folks, and some saying a better supply of touchscreen panels for Windows 8 notebooks would pick that up as we head into late next -- late this calendar year. And I'm wondering, is that in your guidance or would that be providing upside?","Stephen D. Milligan","Right now, we, as well as many of our customers in the PC space, are being very cautious with regards to the demand expectations. We'd certainly like to see and hope to see some of the dynamics that you're talking about to increase demand in the back half of the year. Right now, we are being pretty cautious in terms of our outlook from our standpoint as we talked about earlier.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","So it sounds like if that really transpires, that would be an opportunity for upside for you, is that right?","Stephen D. Milligan","That's possible, that's possible.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. And then my follow-up question, with your 5-millimeter drives, it seems like you're getting a bit of a head start on the competition, and I'm wondering if that's really the case. And also, I'm hearing that the connector for your drive is different than the industry standard and would not be a drop-in replacement for other 5-millimeter drives. And I'm wondering if that's true, and if so, what the philosophy behind that is.","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, we're working very closely with a number of different customers to look for them to adopt to our 5-millimeter drive. And we've been pretty pleased, both in terms of the standard rotating magnetic drive as well as the hybrid drive, to get some adoption of that product as we move through the back half of the year. And so we're very encouraged with where we're at. In terms of the adapter, you're right, it is not a traditional industry standard adapter. We did that to provide for enhanced shock characteristics in terms of the mobility for that drive, and we're getting positive response from our customers so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm just wondering if we can go back and if you can update us on your cost structure a little bit more. And more specifically, what percentage is a variable cost? And then as it relates to that, if we look at utilization, I know it's difficult to kind of paint with a broad brush, but what components have the lowest utilization and conversely, what ones are the highest?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, we haven't really given out the exact split between fixed and variable cost. I mean, you can look at our -- if you check our non-GAAP depreciation, amortization's like $260 million a quarter. So you can assume that that's just probably around half of our fixed cost. I mean, the rest is factory engineering and utilities and maintenance and stuff like that. So I think we have an industry-leading cost structure in terms of what part is variable. And then in terms of capacity utilization, that remains an opportunity in certain parts of our business, I think you have characterized it well. You can't speak about capacity utilization in general, though. There are certain aspects of our infrastructure that are very tight, like I mentioned, that we're investing in test capacity. And there are certain aspects that were not hit by the floods and they are a little bit long right now. I wouldn't want to go into exact detail where that is, but we're balancing that every quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you just help us think about the PC mix and ASP you're embedding going forward? And I'm curious because on the one hand, you have the PC OEMs that are under a greater margin pressure and pressure to reduce pricing to drive some unit volume. So do you think that drives lower capacity drives into the market? And doesn't look like that's a trend you're seeing, but do you think there's an offset here from higher hybrid drive shipments? Can you just talk about the industry dynamics and how to think about that impact to you?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. So OEM customers are our PC customers. I mean, the primary issue that exists is that they've got to get compelling products out there at a cost point that compels consumers to purchase them. And sure, of course they're cost-sensitive. But I think the bigger issue is the product's got to be right. And so if you look at what we're doing in terms of the 5-millimeter product, what we're trying to do is provide a thin and light storage device that our customers can design around that provides a more compelling product for them. It's not going to make a big difference to them if they save $1 or $2 on how much they pay for them.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, with the PC market pretty much kind of where you expected it, can you just talk about where -- how far along you are and reactions to reset capacity, where you're comfortable and maybe just give us some other quantitative or qualitative idea of where you are?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, you've seen us with a couple of quarters of restructuring activity and you see our gross margin well within our model, so we have been very, very active. And that little bit of something that we have to wait and see. I mean, we said that we expect a bit of an uptick in the second half of the year. So we'll just watch that very, very carefully and we've proven historically that we can react in the unit direction in terms of capital deployment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I think Steve talked about kind of impact of PCs on your TAM. I want to touch base on the impact from pure declined SSDs on the TAM, too. So if you look at third party data or what OEMs are saying, they think 2013, we can see at least 20 million pure declined SSDs? So could you maybe talk about, first of all, do you think it's possible, something like that kind of a volume? And secondly, how that could impact the business?","Stephen D. Milligan","So what's interesting in terms of what we've seen is that the issue in terms of hard drive TAM, right, because it's obviously down, it's down from 170 million pre-flood to 135 million this past quarter.  Clearly, we've been impacted in that regard by lower PC sales. But it's not because of SSD replacements within PCs. In fact, we've actually seen that pure SSD as an alternative for hard drives has not changed significantly from what we expected or from what we've seen historically. Now you are seeing dual-drive configurations where you've got SSD in a hard drive. And so that -- but we're agnostic to that. That's okay from our perspective. The issue is that there are competing devices, for example, tablets, that are more compelling to customers that they're buying instead of PCs. And so if you go back to the 5-millimeter story or the hybrid story, what we're trying to do as a company is provide a more compelling storage alternative in a thin and light package that our customers can work around, design more compelling products to have them buy a PC or a PC-like ultraportable device and versus a tablet.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just one last one here regarding Skyera. Skyera makes its own SSDs, so is it possible you might look at kind of selling the SSDs, not just the systems made by Skyera?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, they're an SSD array company, primarily.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Market.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering if you could estimate right now the percent of data being stored on the cloud that's gone on hard drives, and where you think that might be in 3 years?","Stephen D. Milligan","Mark, when we look at it in terms of data storage, we believe that -- I can't remember off the top of my head, frankly, what the timeframe was, but that moving into the future, I think it was either 2017 or 2020 that 85% of data will continue to be stored on rotating magnetic storage.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And then also comment on the margin differential between the drives used in cloud storage and a typical lap drive in a PC.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I mean, the -- the drive that's going to the cloud, of highest quality, highest engineered products and they command the margin premium, so they're significantly higher than the margins in the PC space.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Would I be wrong to ballpark that between 75% and 100% higher on average?","Stephen D. Milligan","You're not going to quit on your question, are you? You're not going to back off? And Wolfgang's not going to answer either.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I could. One, just wondering where you are in progress on a 500-gig per platter notebook and 1 terabyte on desktop. You seem -- I'm assuming you won't say anything in terms of percentage of your mix or anything, but maybe just relative to your roadmap in terms of rolling out those capacity points this year. And then my second question, just going back to enterprise, you had mentioned there's good organic growth in near-line demand or capacity optimized. Just wondering if whether in the near-line or the mission critical these days, you think there's any lingering recovery still from the September quarter inventory correction, if that's helping at all or if that's kind of long done, and what we're seeing now is true demand?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","From the aerial density, we're less than 50% on the latest and greatest. So that represents an opportunity of quarters for us. And then what was your question, near-line was...","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just how much of -- whether near-line are also on that sort of a traditional enterprise, if any of the sort of sequential growth you saw on the quarter that you're seeing now still has anything to do with you're still recovering from September quarter, last year's inventory correction, or if you think that's long past and what you're seeing now is true end demand.","Stephen D. Milligan","We don't believe there's any inventory issue in that area of the market, and that our -- it represents true unit demand.","All right. I want to thank you, again, for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and their suppliers for their support. We look forward to being in touch with you. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes the call for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew. Please go ahead, sir.","Peter Andrew","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations business plans trends and financial outlook. Based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements, please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.","Steve Milligan","Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau Chief Financial Officer.","Before we discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I want to spend a moment talking about the other news we announced today, after a long and fulfilling career with Western Digital spanning two decades. I have informed our Board that I plan to retire as CEO. I will continue to serve as CEO until the Board has identified and appointed a successor.","Western Digital as a significantly different company than the one I first joined in 2002. We are more diversified, more resilient and much better positioned to capture the opportunities of today's evolving data marketplace.","Since my appointment as CEO western Digital has transformed from a storage component provider to a diversified, enabler of data infrastructure with the broadest portfolio in the industry, offering customers a powerful combination of hard drive storage and flash memory products.","We have successfully executed many key strategic initiatives including the company's acquisition of SanDisk, the integration of Western Digital, HGST and SanDisk as well as the extension and Western Digital's 19-year partnership with Kioxia. We now operate a powerful platform that uniquely positions us to provide new architectures and capabilities to manage the volume velocity and variety of data.","As we think about what comes next for our company. I believe now is the right time for Western Digital to begin the transition to its next phase of leadership. Serving as Western Digital CEO for the past 7 years has truly been one of the highlights of my career; I want to thank our team for their support and dedication.","I could not be prouder of what we have accomplished together and consider myself quite fortunate to have worked alongside such a talented team. In terms of next steps I look forward to continuing to work closely with the team. While the Board conducts to search for our next CEO.","Given our strong management team, we expect this transition to be seamless. For our shareholders, our employees and the customers that rely on our best-in-class service and products. Once my successor is on board, I will remain with the company in an advisory role until September 2020 to ensure a smooth transition. I will also continue to serve as a Director on the Western Digital Board for a transition period after my successor is appointed.","With that said, let me turn to our performance for this quarter. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start. Revenue exceeded the guidance range we provided in July, in non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. The upside was driven primarily by the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data center.","We are executing well on the Data Center utilizing the power of our portfolio. At the core of our success in this market is our industry-leading capacity enterprise hard drive solutions and the exceptional value we provide to our data center customers for their diverse storage needs.","During the quarter, we made two important announcements to further extend our product leadership. First, we introduced 16 and 18 terabyte CMR drives and 20 terabyte SMR drive all enabled by our energy assisted recording technology, these drives are expected the sample this quarter.","Additionally, through our continued investments in heads, media and mechanical design. We began shipping an air based 10 terabyte drive providing significant benefits to our customers.","I am pleased to announce we commenced the initial revenue ramp of our MBME based enterprise SSDs to major hyper-scale and OEM customers during the September quarter. Efforts to qualify and ramp additional customers with our next generation products based on our 96 layer 3D flash technology are going well and should position us to further increase our participation in this important market.","Western Digital's ability to offer both hard drives and flash flash-based solutions differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to more strategically partner with our data center customers. Outside the data center the overall demand environment across the consumer, mobile, PC and retail end markets is solid.","Furthermore, we are seeing improving trends across our flash product portfolio and continue to believe that the flash industry has passed a cyclical trough. With the broad and growing product portfolio western Digital remains well positioned to benefit from the long-term drivers of the growth in value of data.","With that I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Mike Cordano","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement. I value and appreciate the partnership we have built together over the past decade and want to acknowledge Steve for his leadership and numerous contributions to Western Digital.","We have quite a bit of time and work to do between now and September of next year and look forward to working together to execute on our plans. As Steve mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a good start.","We had record hard drive exabyte shipments driven by the success of our capacity enterprise drive family. We also had record exabyte shipments in the flash as we benefited from demand elasticity in share gains and SSDs for PCs and notebooks.","In Data Center Devices and Solutions our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth was over 60% year-over-year, led by the ramp of our 14 terabyte drives. These drives now represent the majority of our capacity enterprise unit and exabyte shipments. Industry analysts expect the 14 terabyte capacity point to be the industry's highest volume product through the first half of calendar year 2020.","Building on our aerial density leadership and execution on mechanical design, we announced our plan to accelerate the introduction of our 9 platter energy assisted capacity enterprise drive platform.","This enables us to ship 16 and 18 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives on a unified platform, simplifying the qualification process and reducing the time to market for our customers.","We will be sampling all of these drives by the end of this quarter and we will commence volume shipments in the first half of calendar 2020. In addition, we began shipping a new 10 terabyte air-based product powered by our innovative air flow architecture, underscoring our aerial density and mechanical design leadership.","Given the strength of our capacity enterprise portfolio and the opportunities we see in this market. We now believe our exabyte shipment growth will exceed 40% in calendar year 2019, up from our prior estimate of 30%. In enterprise SSDs our NDME based products experienced a strong quarter of growth and we expect continued growth in the December quarter.","We are qualifying our next generation 96 layer product with additional customers, which positions us for further market share gains in calendar year 2020 and beyond.","We have a unique and sustainable competitive advantage within the data center built on strong customer relationships and a strong product portfolio. Our strategic position within this important end market will drive future revenue growth.","In Client Solutions revenue grew on a sequential basis, driven by an improving pricing environment and a seasonal increase in bit shipments. This quarter we began shipping 96 layer QLC based retail products and external SSDs.","The Trust and reputation of our brand and our customers preference for the performance and reliability of our solutions are key differentiators. In Client Devices the main contributor to our year-over-year decline was our decision to limit our participation in the mobile market.","On a sequential basis, we expect to ship more bits into the mobile market in the December quarter. In PCs and notebooks, we gained market share and client SSDs as our exabytes shipment growth exceeded 70% year-over-year.","Our bit production of 96 BiCS4 surpassed 64 BiCS3 during the September quarter. We are on track to commercialize BiCS4 across all our product lines by the end of calendar 2019. Our JV partner K1 fab and Western Digital executed well bringing the Yokkaichi fabs back to full production after the power outage limiting output reduction four exabytes.","Our flash supply is tight and we continue to believe that any excess inventory in the flash industry supply chain will be substantially reduced by the end of calendar 2019. We expect flash industry supply bit growth to be in the mid 20% range in calendar 2019. And in the low 30% range in calendar 2020.","In addition to continued growth in our existing flash portfolio and capacity enterprise markets, we see several new incremental growth opportunities. First, the launch of the next generation gaming consoles will be important events for the gaming industry and our flash business, we expect these new console to utilize high capacity flash storage to improve the gaming experience.","Second, we expect to expand our product portfolio and diversify our customer base for the mobile market with our UFS, eMMC and custom solutions. Finally our recent announcements of 3D flash products for the automotive and industrial markets will further expand our opportunities in these growing and more stable flash-based markets.","I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.","Bob Eulau","Thanks, Mike. I also want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement and look forward to helping to enable a seamless transition to the next CEO. I'm pleased to announce the revenue for the September quarter exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided in July and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the high end of the range.","Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. This was up 11% sequentially as we experienced growth in Data Center Devices and Solutions and client Solutions. Revenue was down 20% year-over-year as we faced a tough compare tough comparable quarter in fiscal 2019, by end-markets Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 20% sequentially and 6% year-over-year due to the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data centers.","Please recall that a year ago based on discussions with our customers we predicted that in the second half of calendar 2019. We would return to growth in capacity enterprise. We are experiencing that predicted rebound now. On a sequential basis client solutions revenue grew 18% on seasonally stronger flash bit shipments and a stronger flash pricing environment.","Client Solutions revenue declined 4% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in hard drive TAM. Client Devices revenue was up 1% on a sequential basis and decreased 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was a result of our decision to scale back flash bit shipments to the mobile market, flash price declines and a reduction in the hard drive TAM.","By product category, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 36% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were flat and bit shipments were up 9% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year, average price per hard drive was $81. Exabyte shipments were up 23% sequentially, hitting a new record level.","As we move on to costs and expenses; please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the September quarter was 24.8% with a flash gross margin of 19.3% and our hard drive gross margin of 28.5%. We completed all of our cost of revenue reduction activities we outlined in January, resulting in a decrease of more than $100 million in quarterly spending.","The hard drive gross margin was up slightly from the June quarter and we expect the December quarter gross margin to be approximately 30% as we fully realize the benefits of the cost reduction efforts.","Flash, gross margin was up on a sequential basis as we benefited from a better flash pricing environment. K1 fab cost was $64 million higher than expected. Excluded from the cost of revenue was a $68 million charge related to the power outage.","Operating expenses were $767 million. Adjusting for a normal 13 week quarter operating expenses were below the $740 million run rate target. During the quarter we completed all of our operating expense reduction efforts announced in January.","In addition, once we complete the exit of our storage systems business, we should start to see an approximately $25 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses beginning in the March quarter.","Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $253 million and free cash flow was $294 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were inflow of $41 million.","As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds flowing back and forth between us and the joint venture. From a full fiscal year, we continue to expect capital expenditures that will flow through our cash flow statement to be under $500 million.","Total capital expenditures, which include our portion of joint venture leasing and self operating funding is expected to be similar to last fiscal year between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In the September quarter, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders. We paid down debt by $319 million which included an optional $250 million debt pay down. As our cash generation continues to improve.","Our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After paying our dividend our next priority will be to reduce our debt. At the end of the quarter we have $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, our $2.25 billion revolver remains unused and our gross debt outstanding was $10.4 billion.","Total inventory dollars were flat on a sequential basis, but higher than projected as a joint venture fab recovered faster than expected. This resulted in a sequential increase in flash inventory, particularly at the end of the quarter while hard drive inventory declined about $100 million sequentially.","Moving on [Technical Difficulty] with the guidance. So again this is non-GAAP guidance and as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 25% to 26%. Please note that this range includes approximately $75 million in costs associated with the K1 fab.","Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million above the $748 million run rate target due to higher variable compensation spending. We expect interest and other expense of $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be 26% plus or minus 2 points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.45 and $0.65 assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares.","With that I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And Steve, congrats on the retirement has been great working with you. Two questions if I can, real quick. So first of all I guess one of the things that stands out a little bit is the capacity shipment number on flash up only about 9% sequential. By my math that's up maybe high single digits on a year-over-year basis.","So can you talk a little bit about, it seems like the product portfolio is in a great position and ramping client SSD, capacity shipments were strong. I'm just curious of why we, it seems to be a little bit muted. As far as the capacity shipment trends and flash. And what's your expectation going into the December quarter for capacity ship?","Mike Cordano","So Aaron, let me address that. So the primary reason for that is really the point that I made and Bob made in our comments is we did not participate in a substantial way in the mobile marketplace in the quarter just completed. So that's the primary driver of bit shipment in the quarter.","Steve Milligan","And Aaron, recall - this is Steve. Recall, that that lack of participation in the mobile market was by choice. From our standpoint given that the profitability levels for that segment of the market, we're not at all attractive.","Aaron Rakers","Okay, fair enough. And then as a second question on near capacity enterprise drives in the slide deck. You know that you now expect the overall the market to quote unquote approach 30% year-over-year growth. I think last quarter you talked about growth meaningfully exceeding that 30% level. I know you guys are talking about north of 40% growth in your capacity shipments.","But what's changed over the last quarter, is there have been a bit of a softening in terms of your expectation. I guess, going into the December quarter. What's really driving that change of growth expectations?","Mike Cordano","So, Aaron I think for us, we actually updated our performance on the year. We originally had stated last quarter, we'd be north of 30% for us. We updated that guidance north of 40. We're actually seeing strength in exabyte consumption across the capacity enterprise segment.","Now the other thing that's happening for us is more unique is the power of the 14 terabyte product is doing quite well. And obviously we are gaining market share in that segment that's showing up on an exabyte basis.","Aaron Rakers","It is under constraints in the market, which is tempering the overall market, the industry expectation?","Steve Milligan","No, I think we would suggest the industry will grow at north of 30, we will grow at north of 40 and again that's all up from our last outlook on both numbers.","Aaron Rakers","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thank you. And Steve good luck with your next endeavor and was very nice working with you. Moving on to questions. Just to follow up. It's very helpful when you talk about exabyte shipment guide, especially for the near-line and as you look into the next year, how do you see that exabyte shipment target changing and again this is for 2020 versus 2019 and how should we think about the mix of the near line exabyte as a percentage of the overall exabyte shipment for Western Digital.","Mike Cordano","Yeah, so let me just comment specifically capacity enterprise. We would expect for 2020, our current outlook is about 35% year-over-year growth. So continued strength year-over-year and so we don't split out total HDD exabyte growth, we don't specify them.","Steve Milligan","And by the way many then 35% is consistent with our longer term expectations.","Mike Cordano","Sure. You kind of pre-into my prepared question as by saying that you didn't participate in the mobile segment as it relates to your NAND shipment and there is a debate as to what happens to that inventory in the channel reserved mobiles segment, as you look into the March quarter.","So with that as the background, how do you see the supply and demand in NAND looking into the March quarter and I'm not asking for a guide. I just want to better understand your view you didn't participate in the market and in that context, how do you see your prices trending into March quarter.","Steve Milligan","Yeah. So we'll take that maybe we first off, as we indicated, we believe that we passed the trough in terms of the flash cycle. In the overall inventory situation is improving and other words supply is getting much more aligned to demand, and we would expect that largely for ourselves and for the industry as we exit the December quarter that things will be fairly imbalanced now when you move into the March quarter.","And let me actually broaden that question a bit, when you move into the first half of the year. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that we will see a typical seasonal decline in terms of from a demand perspective. Supply is relatively linear.","And so we will have to just like we do largely every year in terms of the calendar cyclicality, we'll have to manage through that, but then as we move to the back half of the year where we will see.","And this is the back half of calendar year a calendar year 20, we will see that begin to flip demand will begin to improve and we will see rather than modest improvement in our financial results that we've been saying, we should see an accelerating improvement in our performance from a financial perspective, as we move into the back half of calendar 2020.","Mike Cordano","Mehdi, I will just give you some numbers to work with there. We talked about low '30s on supply bit growth. We would expect demand for the calendar year to be slightly above that.","Mike Cordano","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. And Steve again congrats on your retirement and best of luck in your future endeavors. Two questions if I may. Taking mobile for a moment, you referenced that mobile margins have not been attractive for the last two quarters but is that because you don't have captive DRAM.","I guess, how important is that, is it for you to have either captive DRAM or a new long-term supply agreement for DRAM and you contemplate your competitive position in smart phones over time.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, let me answer that. So let me delineate mobile. So there is the discrete and component part of mobile and then there is the MCP which includes DRAM. I think, strategically, we do not see MCP is a long-term strategic place for us to operate. We're focusing our\u2026","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Speaker?","Steve Milligan","Yes. Sorry, can you hear us now?","Operator","Yes, we can.","Steve Milligan","Okay, let me back up and repeat that. I don't know where we dropped off. Our mobile market participation let me break into two components. One is the MCP business that includes DRAM, the second is discrete and component participation in mobile end-use applications.","Strategically we've moved away from product investment in MCP and over the longer horizon. It's not an area of product focus for us. So when we talk about participation is that, for us the discrete business which we chose for economic reasons to minimize our participation as we had higher value places to put our bets. So we see that sequentially improving and the economics in mobile improving along with other segments of the market.","Karl Ackerman","That's helpful, Mike. As my follow-up shifting gears to gross margins for a moment. Clearly you and your peers are operating well below normalized run rates in NAND. At the same time so I think your outlook for hard drive gross margins are good. But still a little bit below where we were roughly a year ago.","I guess we'll be exit of the systems business or areas of the systems business be the primary driver for gross margin improvement in hard drives, and I guess how do we think about the margin implications from the incremental disk and heads on those higher capacity drives. Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so I'll address that. And then Bob and Mike can join in and add any additional color. So the first thing is the exiting in the system business will have no material impact one way or the other on our gross margins. So if you look at our hard drive gross margins. I mean, let's be clear about that. Our hard drive gross margins, although good levels are not where we want them to be.","We want those hard drive gross margins to be north of 30% in the low 30% range. We are still dealing with some of the cost overhang of exiting our [indiscernible] manufacturing facility. That is now behind us. And so we should see our drive margins improve into that low 30% range as we exit this the December quarter and then obviously, our intent is to sustain and possibly improve that over a period of time.","Flash, gross margins are clearly not where we want them to be. They are improving albeit at a slow rate. We would continue to expect as we see this sort of ripple through the market because different customers started at different levels, different market started at different levels.","The pace of that improvement is not linear for all of those aspects. But we'll continue to see steady improvement in our flash margins this quarter and then into subsequent quarters. And as I indicated earlier, we expect that improvement to improve at a improved rate at a better rate as we move into the second half of calendar 2020.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I have follow ups around gross margins and maybe versus to better understand the outlook for NAND and that it get the guiding for margins to improve somewhat, next quarter. You sort of understand around ASPs on a like-for-like basis, if you can give more color on what you're assuming there given the comments about a cyclical bottom?","Steve Milligan","Yeah, I can start. And first of all, I want to remind you on the NAND side. We do have a headwind with the K1 startup costs and bringing up that fab and we are beginning production there. But there is probably in the neighborhood of 3.0 headwinds that we're faced with on the NAND side. And as we've ramped volume, then obviously the margins will improve everything else being equal.","So in terms of a flash overall as we get to equilibrium between supply and demand, we're definitely expecting that the pricing will get better as we move through 20. Mike or Steve was saying. So I think it will take a little bit of time to work through that, but I think we're going to be a good price.","Mark Delaney","Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then my follow-up was on the hard drive gross margin again along the lines of the prior questioning. I have been under the impression that for the December quarter, hard drive gross margins could hit 30% especially given the upside that the company has seen the near line business, which I think typically runs at least 30%, if not higher.","Is there anything in terms of increased headwinds around gross margins of the company has seen in the December quarter. This maybe keeping hard drive gross margins under 30% or was kind of the wrong impression about the ability to hit 30% with my previous expectations for the December.","Steve Milligan","Let me, because I get kind of this one I feel strongly about. We will -- we are intent is to have gross margins north of 30% for our hard drive business this quarter, the December quarter. And so there is no headwind at present, of course, there can be things that will happen. But there's nothing at present that indicates that we won't hit that level.","Mike Cordano","And the other thing I would add, Marc is, if you look out over time we expect more and more growth in terms of capacity enterprise will become a bigger percentage of our overall mix and that will help the margins go up as well.","Mark Delaney","Got it. That's it, thank you very much. And Steve good luck with your future endeavors.","Steve Milligan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I think on the folks a, just on the gross margin kind of the NAND inflection. I think a lot of people looking for kind of like $0.80 or even $1 for in December quarter guide you the improving memory environment.","So I guess maybe can you help us at least understand how you guys think at the inflection in terms of how much leverage, you're going to get on the gross margin side, if we look out, let's say 3 or 4 quarters. And I'm trying to understand the comment about how you're going to see a more material inflection in the back half for calendar '20?","Steve Milligan","So a couple of things. Let me talk about the dynamics in the current period. We talked about. So when we look at where we started from all end markets in flash were not created equal relative to pricing and margin. We also noted that mobile was a inferior performing segment for us. We are taking more of that on this quarter, as a percentage of the total. So that is having a bit of a headwind, relative to the flash margin in the current quarter.","To Steve's comments earlier on 2020 we see supply demand in pretty good shape as we come into 2020. But the normal seasonality of the year we got to make sure we're managing through that in a cautious way and we expect that is a year moves on. As we head towards the middle of the year in the back end that will continue to improve in the rate of margin improvement in flash will accelerate in the back half of the year.","Mitch Steves","Okay. And then in terms of the NAND gross margin is that go back to like '30s in the back half of 20. I mean, just any sort of rough metric would be helpful?","Steve Milligan","Well, we are, I mean, let me be clear on this we're not providing guidance beyond what we've done in terms of flash gross margins. But I'll tell you where we need to get to and where we want to get to is back to where flash gross margins are in that 40% range.","That that's a margin level that we view as attainable over a period of time and it's also a margin level that we believe is required to get sufficient return on the capital that we are investing in this business. So that's where we want to head to.","Mitch Steves","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.","CJ Muse","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins. Specific to the NAND side, can you quantify the K1 fab costs in the September quarter. I think you said $75 million in the December quarter and how we should think about that progressing into 2020. And then I guess as a second question there on the flash bit side, it looks like implied in there. Given these costs roughly bit growth of only 10% or so in the quarter.","So it looks like you're really growing about 19%, 20% for the year versus many of your competitors who are suggesting low '30s for the industry and so I guess is that a function of just deciding not to want to play in the mobility side, is it a function of not having the right bids or is there something else. Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Now, let me, let me address the last question first. In terms of us growing and first off, the big growth that we're seeing from a demand of revenue perspective is consistent with previous expectations. It hasn't changed and by the way, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that we took a meaningful amount of production offline starting earlier this year. Independent of the power outage because we saw the oversupply conditions well, we saw it coming.","And we saw that situation being let's just call it untenable and so we were reducing our bit output from a supply perspective to help offset that growth that unnecessary growth from a supply perspective that created the substantial price decline that we in the industry realized in the back half of ' 18 and also into 2019.","Mike Cordano","So I ask Bob to address. So CJ in terms of the September quarter that we just finished the K1 costs were at $64 million and what I said in the guidance as we expect in the December quarter. That will be in the neighborhood of $75 million. We think they will start to come down from that point in time. But this is, I mean this is new production capacity we're putting in place, it becomes a part of our fixed cost over time.","Bob Eulau","Yeah C.J one other comment I'll make is when you think about this on a bit share comparative basis when you think about it from a bit capacity output basis. Obviously, we continue to remain in the same proximity a ratio to others. So this was simply us choosing to not produce very low margin product for the as reasons [indiscernible]","CJ Muse","It makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Excuse me. Good afternoon and sorry for another gross margin question, but maybe\u2026","Steve Milligan","We have to start banning gross margin question.","Steven Fox","Yeah, I know last one. Let me get this in. So in terms of just the mix impact on NAND gross margins, can you maybe talk a little bit about what's going on, how mix is affecting the gross margin guidance for the current quarter versus what you just reported NAND gross margins and then along similar lines, you mentioned some incremental growth next year from things like next generation gaming and industrial.","Can you talk about their mix impact on gross margins? And if I did I get it in one more given what you said about the first half of the calendar year, are you able to at least hold gross margins around current levels or based on what you do with where you choose to put your bids or do we backtrack a little? Thank you.","Bob Eulau","Well I'm going to address the last question first. We would expect that our profitability levels certainly from a margin percentage standpoint will continue to modestly improve as we move into the first half of the year.","Mike Cordano","Okay. And back to the mix. Let me just reiterate within the flash business, we're taking on a greater proportion mobile business this quarter, which is a margin drag and is dampening our sequential margin performance, to some degree. On the flash side and then Bob also talked about the fact startup. So those two things are affecting the flash margin in this quarter.","When we go into 2020 certainly a number of the new markets are good bit consumers the gaming business, we think that that is going to be not only a good consumer of bits but at reasonably attractive margins and industrial and automotive are even better yet relative to margins and more stable non-cyclical.","Steve Milligan","And yeah -- Bob already indicated that the K1 costs are kind of a 3-point drag and then if you neutralize for mix. I think that we would all be seeing a much more satisfying increase in our flash margins when you neutralize for those two items. And I think that's important for all of us to keep that in mind, the trajectory is in the right direction. It's just that there are other moving parts that tend to mask those improving trends.","Steven Fox","Got it. And Steve congrats on all your accomplishments at Western Digital. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great, thanks. Maybe one more question on this, on the flash side, I know you talk about few times about strategically walking away from the mobile mix, can you remind us your mix within the NAND flash business today and how do you think that will change a year from now. Is there more tailwinds coming from this mix change in mix, and what are the areas that have better margins of worth more than the average for the business?","Steve Milligan","So we don't specifically disclose the ratio of flash participation. But I can give you some color on relative performance, certainly the areas a big investment for us that we emphasize our own where we want to grow our participation. So enterprise SSD fast growing higher overall margins than the average over time. Industrial embedded both similarly situation in the higher margins.","Good growth rates and then ultimately certain segments of mobile over time are attractive and we're focused on those. Hence our UFS product investment, so the higher end higher performance part of that marketplace. So we put a big emphasis on quality of revenue and seeking out those higher margin more stable end markets and those will be examples that we're focused on.","Sidney Ho","Great. My follow-up question; I'm sure you welcome a hard drive question. The last earnings call, you talked about introducing 16 terabyte CMR and as 18 terabyte SMR. But you ended up launching a higher capacity about two months later, can you talk about why you made that change in the roadmap and what kind of feedback are you getting from your customers so far?","Steve Milligan","Yeah. So the reason that we made that decision and it's actually quite simple is that we, we made faster progress in terms of our 9 platter platform than what we had previously anticipated. And so the advancements that we were making from a mechanical perspective allowed us to pull in that platform sooner than what we anticipated, which was favorably received by our customers from a market place perspective, which I'll ask Mike to elaborate on.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And I think a number of dimensions of this. Obviously, it gets them to 18 and 20 terabyte sooner than they would have otherwise. So the TCO benefit when you combine cost per bit with the other elements like slot tax because you know you eliminate some slots required and also the quality that we deliver with our products, the whole economic equation is better and then we talked about, we get a multi platform qualification.","So for them their ability to qualify a single platform that covers all of those configurations is both a simplifying of their efforts on cost reduction of their efforts and it gets us to market earlier. So all positive trends from the customers' perspective and getting to that new 18 terabyte CMR in 20 terabyte SMR capacity earlier is a big value.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, thanks guys for taking the questions. And Steve, congrats as well for me, I know we have a little more time with you, but it's certainly been, I do have a gross margin question guys. But I'm going to start with the hyperscale question just provide some the leaf here. So first a clarification, the comment earlier in the Q&A about 35% growth for calendar ' 20 year-over-year was that your hyperscale outlook for calendar ' 20 or was that another.","Steve Milligan","No, that's -- yeah that's total capacity enterprise. So hyperscale and OEM consumption of that class together.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks for that. And could you update for us. You have an updated view on what this cycle might look like this hyperscale cycle might look like. Now, I think you made some comments the last couple of quarters.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, I think the only thing we can say as we continue to see strength of the cycle. End of the first half of 20. I don't think we want to go any beyond that that supported in the 35% year over year growth parameters. So we don't see enrolling over yet. No.","Ananda Baruah","And the, any sense, if the incremental strength is pro in for this year it's been a little bit stronger than we thought is pull into this year your -- point to sustainability as we move kind of move into the March quarter.","Steve Milligan","So it would point to sustainability end of the first half of the calendar year '20.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, that's great. And then just quickly on the flash gross margin. So as we think about the different layers of the headwind that could roll off, it sounds like there is the mobile and that 300, sorry the K1 doing the basically spread, but it sounds like as you participate more mobile of the headwinds will diminish sort of incoming quarters before we get the inflection in few quarters, will the K1 cost with the 300 basis points headwind. Will that also kind of gradually roll off until we get into September quarter?","And then whether the other levers that will also contribute to the gradual expansion in margin before we get into the second half of next year. I just don't want to miss anything. I want to make sure I'm understanding it appropriately. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","Yeah. So I'll start with the K1 question. So right now I mean we're just beginning production in that fab and so it will be a gradual improvement in absorption over the next few quarters and eventually it will be fully absorbed and have a cost structure. Similar to what we experienced elsewhere.","Mike Cordano","Yeah, I think the other drivers are really looking at the individual segments. And as I talked about, we are continuing to expand the product portfolio and increased participation and let's call it higher quality revenue segments like enterprise SSD and other sort of high-end mobile marketplaces as we progress into 2020. So think of it is customer and product mix improvements as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Yeah, hi, thanks guys, congrats Steven, and good luck with your next endeavors. Just on the flash side. I was wondering going back on the gross margin, and that's the last question here, if you could look at, you said you're trying to exit the mobile segments but wondering as you look at first half, do you expect to step up as exit some of this mobile segments in what kind of margin improvement should expect on the flash side with as you move more into the SSD, or less price sensitive markets and same question is on that, sorry go ahead.","Steve Milligan","Well, I was going to respond to that. I'm sorry. But, so let me clarify. We have not exited from the mobile market, we chose not to participate in segments of that market for a period of time because the margins, it was not, it made and made no economic sense. Okay. As we see the pricing environment in that market. Begin to stabilize and improve consistent with improving supply and demand dynamics, we will be increasing our participation in that market starting this quarter.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the hard to strive side you've got talked about 16 and trade, but can you give us some color of how, when you expect to ramp some of those products as you go through 2020. Thanks.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. So obviously we said we're sampling those in the current quarter and we expect to ramp that in the first half of calendar ' 20 so that's in the not too distant future.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.","Nehal Chokshi","Thank you. Just for verification purposes here or education purposes. What is the NAND flash industry typically seasonally peak in terms of bit demand from a monthly perspective?","Steve Milligan","Well, I mean this selling a answer. It's the old adage that the best quarter of the year is October, November and December, it's around that time but I don't know, literally which month.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. And so, Mike, I think you made a comment that the exabyte loss from the power outage turned out to be 4 exabyte, 6 exabytes but you still expect that the excess inventory industry wide would be flushed out by the end of this year. So given that lower exabyte loss, have you seen better demand and expected over the past three months.","Steve Milligan","So I think in general, our bit consumption of demand has been at or a well above what we thought. So our comments were we thought. By the end of the year the industry inventories would be substantially improved and we stand by that.","Nehal Chokshi","And what's been the driver of that better-than-expected demand for the NAND Flash bits?","Steve Milligan","I think we've seen generally speaking, some a little bit better mix in terms of capacity per unit. And I think some of the end markets are a little more robust than maybe we originally expected, including mobile.","Nehal Chokshi","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Speakers I'm showing no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Peter Andrew","All right. Thank you for joining us today. I would also like to extend a thank you to all of our employees, customers and business partners. We look forward to a successful year together. Have a great rest of the day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21899":["Western Digital Corp.

Welcome to the Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, our acquisitions, integration activities, and achievement of synergy goals; demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, deleveraging plans, our joint ventures with Toshiba and the outcome of related legal proceedings, investments in Fab 6, and supply of NAND flash memory.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2017.

I thank you in advance for your cooperation.","And now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.","We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver, as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader.","For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.","I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So, as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.","From the beginning, our number one priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy into finding a resolution, one that respects our partnership, and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship.","Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders, such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ-KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management.","It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders. While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with the consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.","There are two potential paths for resolution. The stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future, or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum, following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the three-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion.","SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018 in advance of Toshiba's announced timeframe to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious. And it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.","With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that, over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment.","This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions, associated with the first tranche, are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good-faith commercially reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed. Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either.","As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly-owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly-owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.","In closing, I want to emphasize the following; first, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process. Second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief.","Third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently, as we did with the recently filed FAQ, and through public forums like this call.","And finally, I want to reiterate that our number one priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day one, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders.","I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion.","With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results were better than expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technologies.","In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products, such as iNAND, gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications.","Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs' product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets.","Our Client Solutions revenue grew strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched two new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand Base and My Cloud Home, as well as the world's highest-capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with a broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.","In Data Center Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter, as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.","In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth with reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities such as our 12-terabyte offering to handle the growth of varied workloads, and as the component shortages ease.","In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation helium offering. Customer qualification activities in our fourth-generation helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive, remained on track and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter.","We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012. Just over two weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.","Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market in years ahead.","In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center applications. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our active scale products addressing big data, the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers.","In our flash joint ventures, during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the uses of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer base products in calendar 2017.","From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018. Furthermore, as we previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.","In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position with our capacity enterprise helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets, as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.","It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets.","Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion; Client Devices was $2.7 billion; and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives.","Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products.","Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply\/demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.","Turning to operating expense, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently-acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making investments in our future capabilities.","Or non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Or non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.","In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously-declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and will continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure, while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.","We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions.","I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter. Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million.","We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.","We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the details related to Toshiba. My only question here is really around the guidance here for 2018. Can you give us a sense here in terms of how you expect the mix of SSD versus HDD to play out? Will there be any sort of outsized change there? And do you actually get a benefit as NAND pricing does come down? Do you actually see the potential for pent-up demand for more NAND-based or SSD-based products for WD? Thank you.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","So, Mark, let me give you some color on that. So, I think as we see ourselves progressing through this fiscal year, we feel fully comfortable with placement of our bit output in the various market segments. So, the demand is there sufficient to consume our bit output. Relative to the mix and penetration of SSD, I think that is somewhat slowed based upon NAND constraints at an industry basis. We would expect though the long-term penetration to kind of continue as planned, nothing sort of untoward.","Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess the first question maybe to start with, on the Toshiba dynamic, if they do go forward with the transaction that they've proposed, I'm curious, and you don't need to give me the exact details, but do you think you have a viable plan B, C and D to secure bit capacity beyond the calendar 2019 you've talked about?","And broadly, the cross-licensing agreement you guys both have mentioned, the SanDisk IP, does that apply for Toshiba, even if they decide to ramp up production unilaterally without Western Digital? Or does that cross-licensing only get held up while it's done together?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Amit, this is Steve. I'll take the second question first. I would prefer not to comment on that in terms of how the technology licensing arrangements work. And then the second thing is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the joint venture agreements require bit output to be provided to us over a period of time, out to 2029.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. I guess if I could just maybe follow up on one thing, Intel, on their call, is just talking about signing a long-term NAND agreement and getting $2 billion of prepayment for that in 2017 and 2018. I'm curious, given the fact that NAND demand keeps outpacing the supply based on even what you guys are talking about, is there a potential for you guys to enter into strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers? And are you perhaps already doing that?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes. I think those sort of long-term arrangements are can be part of our ongoing practice. So, yes, we do those sorts of things, and from time-to-time, prepayments would be one of the elements of those agreements.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is the open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. In terms of NAND availability, how are you dealing with allocation? Right now, we are going through ramp-up by some of the smartphone OEM customers that you have. And, in that context, given the tightness, how should we think about allocation mix between enterprise SSD and embedded application? Do any of these customers have a long-term agreement, which would require you to fulfill? Or should we think about economics of each driving the allocation? And I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes. So, our allocation philosophy has two dimensions. Obviously, one of them you referenced, which is economic. The other is strategic. So we're looking at our goals of, sort of, optimizing between our current and mid-term financial results and our long-term objectives of growing and diversifying our customer base across multiple product segments. So, it's a complex formula, and it really is based on those two things. Obviously, based upon our results, we are growing in basically all of those segments and you can see the results of some of that activity.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yes. And I think just to add to that, the diversity from a market, product, and customer perspective that we have, oh, by the way, is by design. And the other thing is that, it allows us \u2013 it provides more resilience from a financial perspective to our model. So I think that diversification concept is something that is very central to the way that we run and manage the business.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Got it. And then looking longer term, especially with the nearline and higher density products, when should we expect MAMR samples to be out there? And I'm assuming that both HAMR and MAMR products are going to be out there. And for us from outside, we're trying to figure out when is the earliest that we could look into the market and figure out the differences and the cost benefit for each technology?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","So, we said in our announcement that we would have samples out late in 2018 and production in 2019, which I just commented on. Relative to sort of our reasons for picking it, I stated in my comments obviously our view is the economic or commercial competitiveness of the technology made it a pretty obvious choice for us. Obviously, we needed to get some technology breakthroughs to get confident around our ability to achieve the areal density results required, but once that was done, it was a clear choice for us. One of the things I will point you to is really our internal manufacturing processes, and the ability for us to leverage the current perpendicular or PMR based manufacturing technologies and tooling we have in place.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","So, by late 2018, we should see field data that would help us compare the difference between the two?","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","No, we will ship customer samples in 2018, we will ramp production in 2019.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Mike, you talked about the high-cap capacity growth reaccelerating or picking back up in 2018, after being muted in part by DRAM in 2017. I mean, is that just a sort of a DRAM availability thing? Or is there also an indication in terms of you talking to customers, cloud builders, service providers? I mean are you seeing their demand looking better irrespective of component availability? Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Let me back up a little bit. I think the demand has been there all along, right? So, what's happening in 2017 is not a reflection of the true demand environment, it's certainly been muted by external or temporary factors. And yes, our view of 2018 is based upon close planning work with our customer base both in hyperscale and outside of that.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And do you find from your OEM customers \u2013 I mean are they more traditional OEMs? Are they taking enough high cap to offset declines in mission critical? Or is it really just now at this stage, it depends on what the cloud service guys do? Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Well, yeah, so for us certainly the big consumers of capacity enterprise are the cloud providers, or hyperscalers. But the traditional storage OEMs still buy at a substantial rate relative to its impact on performance enterprise hard drives, it's really not capacity enterprise eroding that, it's SSD's and the new architectures and better cost performance you can get, displacing a new system design and new architectures that performance tier with flash based products.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you. Just curious, as you roll up your forecast for fiscal 2018 \u2013 I'm sorry, looking into calendar 2018 I should say, I'm just curious what assumptions \u2013 I know you talked about long-term supply growth in that 35% to 45% range. What assumption are you making in terms of your own capacity, ability to supply capacity growth? And in that context, what are you assuming as far as your cost, the price erosion and your ability to take cost down as you ramp 3D 64-layer and beyond?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Mike can take the first part, and then Mark can take the second part.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. Aaron, we talk about our expectation for bit growth rate, which is 35% to 45%. We would expect we will be growing in that same range, and we expect to be able to maintain the expected cost reductions that we've talked about, which are in that longer-range models 15% to 25%, as we continue to convert from 2D to 3D, it's sort of at the 15% to 20% at an industry level.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And kind of in that same context, as you look at the overall industry supply\/demand dynamics, I know you talked about more or less a reiteration of favorable trends through the first half of the year, have you seen any indications at all, either positive or negative, as far as that potential even extending further or shortening?","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, I think at this point it's really too early to tell. Certainly, we don't have any indication strongly to one side or the other, at this point.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Steve, it sounds like you're pretty confident in supply here in 2018, 2019 and beyond, but can you give us some sense of confidence that these JVs will keep up with future NAND development, so future output as the technology sort of progresses? And will you still have the supply, if arbitration proceedings potentially go against you? And I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, it's in both of our best interest that we continue to advance the capabilities of the joint ventures from a technology and from a manufacturing perspective. And so, we're confident that ourselves and our joint venture partner will continue to invest appropriately in that capability going forward. And that's independent, frankly speaking, of how the arbitration proceedings turn out.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And can you comment on expectation sort of NAND pricing? How much was that up relative to your expectations of flat in September quarter? And what is sort of embedded in expectations in your December quarter guide? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I think we talked about last quarter that ASPs had flattened. That was our expectation coming into this quarter, and that's really our expectation as we sit today. So we don't see continued movement in a substantial way up, but it's being sustained at the current level.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Great quarter, and thanks for the discussion on the JV. Just one for Mark, on gross margin over the midterm, so obviously you expect supply demand fundamentals in NAND to stay favorable through the first half. Can you just address and even qualitatively, how you expect the GM line to trend after that point? And I ask mostly because the Street is still north of 40%, which is obviously solidly above the high end of your range. So any forward-looking GM commentary would be helpful.","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. And I think, certainly, as we look more near term, we are getting some benefit from the ramp of our BiCS3 technology, so that will give us some gross margin benefit, and that will continue into the first part of calendar 2018, which is a positive margin benefit. As we look out through and into 2018, that is our seasonally slower period in the first half for HDD, so we're going to have some offsetting declines in gross margin there. And I think net-net, we would expect still healthy gross margin through the rest of the fiscal year, but we wouldn't expect it to continue at the exact same level due to those seasonal factors and the mix with HDD.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to circle back on the NAND technology roadmap questions that were addressed earlier today. I understand that the Bain-led consortium must fulfill your supply agreements in place through 2029, but do the master agreements stipulate that Toshiba and the Bain-led consortium must invest in 3D NAND technology for your existing fabs? Because if not, it would appear that your lack of a supply agreement with Fab 6 today, where I think the current plan is to build 96 layer 3D NAND, limits your technology roadmap beyond the 3D NAND tools that are installed in Fab 3, Fab 4 and Fab 5 today? Thank you.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","As I indicated, we provided a lot of details in terms of my prepared remarks in addition to the 8-K. And as I noted, that our number one priority is the continued longevity and success of the joint venture, and some of the details that you're asking, I'd prefer not to get lost in the weeds in terms of some of those questions at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. When do you see data center solutions returning to growth? Could that happened as early as the calendar first quarter? And then, maybe, Mark, can you comment on where you see OpEx levels exiting the fiscal year?","Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.","Sure. I will take the OpEx question, and then Mike can talk about the Data Center Devices and Solutions. In terms of OpEx, one of the things we should keep in mind is that we tend to have, or we annually have, a small spike in calendar Q1 that has to do with the reset of payroll taxes. So we would otherwise expect OpEx to be relatively consistent through the rest of the fiscal year, other than this slight increase in calendar Q1.","And I think the key point is we will be exiting the year roughly in a position that's consistent with our long-term model, plus or minus, and I think we're currently operating within our long-term model much earlier than we had anticipated. The long-term model being 14% to 16% of revenue. And so I think our continued efficiencies that we're gaining from our achieving the synergy targets and from other transformational projects that we have ongoing should allow us to continue operating in a healthy range consistent with our long-term model.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Relative to the Data Center Devices and Systems \u2013 or Solutions growth, I think two things, two factors, I talked about Exabyte (44:58) growth rate relative to capacity enterprise expected to reaccelerate as well as our continued and planned progress around enterprise SSD product offerings puts us in a good position, as we progress through 2018 calendar year to have growth as we go.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just on the hard disk drive side, I was wondering if you could give us some color on 10-terabyte, how it grew sequentially and how do you see the December quarter and looking out.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah, the color we'll give you is we did see significant quarter-to-quarter growth on 10 terabytes. We also saw the initial ramp on 12 terabytes, and we would expect that will accelerate into the current quarter. So, the continued movements of the market to the highest capacities in this case 10 terabytes and 12 terabytes is progressing very well. And we're very pleased with how that's moving in our business.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And on the NAND side, when you look at the 64-layer NAND, where do you expect the mix of 64-layer by bit exiting this year? And let's say middle of next year, how do you see that? And with the Toshiba spat going on, do you see any disruption in that 64-layer ramp? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","I don't think we provided any numbers for calendar 2018 at this point. But we are getting more fixed re-output (46:38) than the 2D NAND at this point, so we've realized that crossover point. And we've seen no impact of the situation with Toshiba that's changed that. No disruption to what our expectations and plans were previously, and we do not expect that into calendar 2018 either.","Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.","We'll wrap up with this next questioner. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. I just wanted to continue the discussion about the outlook. As we think about the beginning of next year, clearly the PC market has held up a little bit better this year. What's your thinking about the first half of the year? You mentioned some seasonality in your business, is that the area where we should see the most seasonality? And implicitly with gross margins staying in that low 40% range, the seasonality in the first half, presumably when volumes return into maybe the second half of 2018, does that imply that we get some strength back in margins as well? Thanks very much.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","Yes, I think your perspective \u2013 one of the drivers for seasonality is PC, so, yes, you're on it. Also the consumer segments of our business also see a seasonal trends, that would include gaming, as an example. And yes, obviously, when we move into the second half of the calendar year, we do see some absorption benefits that help us on the margin.","Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.","Yeah. From an HDD standpoint, we'll see that. And then for the remainder of the calendar year, the flash margins will depend on the supply\/demand environment.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","All right. So you've got a follow-up question quickly, please? I think we're done. Okay.","Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.","All right.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016, our market positioning, expectations regarding our transformation, growth opportunities, near-term priorities, long-term business model, and strategy execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts, and customer acceptance of our products, data growth and its drivers and our wafer capacity.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC on May 9, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.","Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures.

The definitions of these three end market categories can be found in the quarterly fact sheet.","In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their questions. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights. Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials, and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.","Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79.","Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets. Given unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the","marketplace.","We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees.","With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution. I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity, focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers.","Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet. We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology roadmaps involving legacy WD, HGST, and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the New Fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership.","We announced our next generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, with an industry leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced, and we expect meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017.","And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition. We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile and addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.","I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device, and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.","Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product roadmaps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees.","Coupled with a series of restructuring actions, we have taken over the last two years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of two facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore. Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facilities footprint by almost one fifth and our head count by almost one quarter over the last two fiscal years.","Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results, in HDDs we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year on year basis, primarily driven by shipments of our capacity enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth in our capacity enterprise product line was 47% on a year on year basis, faster than the market growth rate thanks to the ongoing success of our Helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10 terabyte product to high volume, our third generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum.","In enterprise SSDs, we saw strength in sales in both enterprise and cloud customers. From a client devices perspective, we are benefiting from the growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HDD unit shipments decline year-over-year.","In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry leading 15 nanometer technology remained the workhorse and that accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 15 nanometer technologies set another record and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve.","Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our three bit per cell, or X3 architecture, delivering the industry's smallest 256 gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost reduction capabilities beyond our 15 nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2. And this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail, as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.","From a wafer fab standpoint, in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies, for the rest of the year we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for total industry bit supply growth, as we had previously indicated.","However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable a mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.","Switching to the near term, we believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following, new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business along with seasonality. Additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs, even as PC unit volumes shrink. We are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology. And we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash markets such as mobile, and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business.","Offsetting these factors, we have seen share driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5 inch HDD market and the 8 terabyte capacity point in capacity enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas. Our fiscal Q4 performance and forwarded guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.","To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is very unique in our industry. A combination of WD, HGST, and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.","With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q4 financial results.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mike. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.5 billion. Including the partial payout of SanDisk ownership, our non-GAAP gross margin was 31% and operating expenses totaled $691 million. Interest and other expense for the quarter included $181 million of interest expense related to the debt for the SanDisk acquisition.","Non-GAAP tax benefit for the June quarter was $24 million due to the impact of interest expense related to the SanDisk acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $208 million or $0.79 per share. In the June quarter, we generated $355 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $114 million.","Our net CapEx totaled $241 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $8.2 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion was held in the US. After the close of the June quarter and, as Steve mentioned earlier, we utilized $3 billion to pay off the bridge loan.","Finally, I would like to thank Steve and the rest of the leadership team at Western Digital, our employees, and the investment community for your partnership and support over the last two years during my tenure as CFO. As I leave Western Digital to pursue other opportunities, I am confident in Mark's leadership to guide the finance and strategy organization and the company through the transformation that we have undertaken. Mark?","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Thank you, Olivier. It is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I have been with the company and in the industry for many years. Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward.","With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies.","Today we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of three primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these three end markets.","Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value including revenue and exabytes shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mix-up strategies for our NAND and HDD products respectively.","We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top ten customers, enterprise SSDs, and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today.","In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market for value creation drivers and our historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for a transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year.","At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business.","I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance costs over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next five years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make.","Second, due to purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges","With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. And our first question comes from the line of Sherry Scribner with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I just was a little confused about the yen commentary that you made about the hedges. Can you maybe explain where that's going to sit and why that changed? And can you also help us understand what the impact of the yen will be going forward and how we should think about that for earnings. Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Sure, Sherry. So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instruments. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gains. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would have had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for the change in reporting due to purchase accounting.","With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Sherry, just this is Steve. Just to add one comment to that. I think that it's important to note, and we've gone through this in terms of our legacy hard drive business. There is always a number of different areas that create potential volatility in our business. It's our job from a management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet, and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact, I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results. And I think it's important to emphasize that fact.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple questions. I guess first when it comes to the OpEx, I assume that going forward you're just going to give a combined number for OpEx. Is there any sense you could give us today on the breakdown between the two business lines? And should we assume that from $875 million that it declines at some pace over the balance of fiscal 2017? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Rich, this is Steve. So the first thing is, is that we will only be providing total OpEx guidance going forward. We will not be providing, if you want to call it, separate legacy WDC or legacy SanDisk. As we move through the integration process, it will become kind of impossible to do that because we'll be combining \u2013 we're in the process of combining the companies. And then your assumption is correct that as we move through, one, through the tail end of calendar 2016 and into 2017 as we begin to realize synergies, we will see our OpEx begin to decline absent other investments that we need to make to continue to innovate in our business.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Then maybe this is best for Mike. Can you give us any sense on the high cap demand environment, in particular what the hyperscale build-out plans are over the next call it three to six months? Are you confident that the share, the overall share you've got should improve with the 10 terabyte as an example?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think that trend relative to overall share should be favorable with the adoption of the 10 terabyte. We also see the trend of petabyte growth moving to the high end of the range. So we would see the general demand situation in that group of customers as being steady and running at a slightly to the high end of the petabyte growth range, so approaching 40% is what you got to think about.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, and thank you, Olivier, and congratulations, Mark.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. How should we think about the trajectory of gross margins from here, in not just the September quarter as the purchase accounting hit rolls off? It's a better pricing environment given the tighter NAND supply. And then how negative is the impact of ramping 3D NAND when you take those factors together? How should we just think from a high level about the trajectory of gross margins? Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Katy. So to make a few comments. One thing just to, I'll call it, remind everybody is when we do the December 6 Investor Day, we'll obviously be providing updated margin range. We'll also be talking more qualitatively about the hierarchy of our margins between the three different, the slices of revenue that we're providing, data center as well as client devices, et cetera. And so we will be providing additional color going forward. Relative to the trajectory of our margins, it's a little bit early to make a call on that because there's obviously a lot of variables going on, which we sort of alluded to in Mike's commentary. So I don't want to get too over my skis in terms of forecasting of where we think our margins are going to trend. So I'll leave it at that.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. The first question, and I have a follow-up real quick, you talked about the progression of the synergies and moving forward favorably on that front. I'm curious as you look specifically at the Hitachi integration and I think the target was exiting this year at $475 million of realized synergies, where did you come out this quarter with regard to realizing that level of synergies? And how do we think about the progression as we look through fiscal 2017?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll take that and then Olivier or Mark can comment. First off, we are on track to achieving the synergy targets that we set for ourselves as well as outlined externally. We were not specific when we did that as to how that would reflect itself from a quarterly basis. We talked about where we would end up in terms of calendar 2016 as well as in calendar 2017. I believe that we suggested to the investment community that you use some sort of I'll call it straight-line projection in that regard. And I would say that generally speaking,","that's about where we're at. But we're on track to our calendar year-end synergy targets.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then a real quick follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the variables we should consider with regard to free cash flow generation as we move out over the next several quarters? What specifically CapEx trends we should think about?","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","So for the CapEx considerations, I think it's important to remember what the CapEx requirements were for each of the separate businesses and then we can think about them on a combined basis. So we were looking at 5% to 7% of revenue from the HDD business, although we were running a little below that. And then for cash CapEx for the SanDisk business, they were running in the 8% to 10% range. On a combined basis, I think it would be safe to look at something in the 6% to 8% range for planning purposes.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then I would just add in terms of free cash flow, one of the things that we will be doing again in conjunction with the December Investor Day is resetting what we see as our cash conversion targets. We've got a bit more work to do on that as we increase our understanding and also look for optimization opportunities in terms of the combined business. And obviously with the profit ranges and in terms of margin, OpEx, et cetera, that will allow for a better modeling of where we think our free \u2013 operations cash flow will turn out. And then you would back off the CapEx from that to be able to estimate what our free cash flow would be going forward.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Right. And we tried to provide you with visibility into our cash interest expense by highlighting what we were amortizing in terms of the debt discount and issuance expenses. So I think you have the drivers of our free cash flow laid out.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Congrats on a solid quarter. Olivier, we'll miss working with you. And, Mark, welcome. Two if I could, guys. I guess a little bit of an old school question. Steve, what's your TAM view for the second half of the year, calendar year now that the TAM was a little bit firmer than we all thought or at least you guys thought it might be entering the quarter? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so, Ananda, I would say that in terms of \u2013 I'm not going to make a call on the back half in terms of quantitatively, obviously. I'm going to give you a very dissatisfying answer. We would expect that the TAM will be higher in the second half than it was in the first half as a general statement. But more specifically as it relates to calendar Q3, our fiscal Q1, I would say that we would expect the hard drive TAM to be in the range of about 110 million units.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Okay. Okay. Great. No, that's actually very helpful in both regards. So and then the follow-up for me is just with regards to the near line commentary that you made, it sounds like you're expecting pretty solid near line demand in the second half of the year. I think the comment with regards to the 10 terabyte Helium ramping was you expect to, was it gain share as you go through that process? If you could clarify that.","And then I guess a follow-on to that was I'd love your view on sort of where normalized share is on 8 terabyte since Seagate obviously seemed to get some meaningful volume back in the June quarter. Thanks.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, first is seasonality. We see it slightly higher, sort of a 48\/52 on across the calendar year relative to petabyte linearity in the year. So heavier in the back half than the first. Yeah, I think my statements around 10 terabyte were interpreted correctly. I think we have ceded, as you might expect, some 8 terabyte share as our major competitor ramped. We think we're in a leading position on 10 terabyte, which will benefit us in the back half of the year.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the other thing that I would add is we are not expecting to cede any more share.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your guide and your commentary about a tight NAND supply, how should we think about the NAND ASP assumption that is dialed in? And is that a realistic assumption? Or if the tightness were to sustain, would there be a upside from a NAND ASP side? And I have a follow-up.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I'll comment a little bit. Well, two things. One is we see the tightness through the end of the year, so that will have a benefit relative to bit price. We won't comment on the specifics of that. The way we also see it a little longer term, and this really relates to a new industry model, if you will, is the rate of bit cost decline is going to move into a regime that will center around a 20% or so per year we think. Barring supply\/demand dynamics, that's the way the broader market should begin to look at the industry as we proceed into the 3D NAND era.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. Great. And since you mentioned next year and the mix of BiCS3 BIX 3, I'm just trying to better understand your strategy. And I do realize you're going to have an Analyst Day in December, but if the mix of BiCS3 is going to exceed your product expectation or going to have a higher mix of the 64 layer, do you foresee a scenario where you would better able to price your SSDs, or is that going to better help your raw NAND customer? How should we think about these mix shift and its impact to your product offering?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, my comment on part of this, but let me make one thing clear. Part of the strategy that SanDisk had and accordingly our strategy, which oh by the way, we concurred with, is that we want to manage technology transitions when it makes sense from a cost standpoint. So it, right now, we have the leading 2D planar technology from a cost standpoint. So we want to intersect 3D NAND technology when we think it is cost competitive to the incumbent 2D NAND technology. We believe that that will occur with our BiCS3 technology.","And so, and we're pleased with the progress. We've still got a lot of work that we've got to do to go make that happen. And, but that's where we believe with 64 layers, that's where we believe that that cost crossover point will begin to occur, and we'll be ramping accordingly when that takes place through 2017. So I'll have Mike comment from kind of a product perspective.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so in addition to sort of the general base of cost advantage that Steve just described, it really allows us to allocate sooner and a larger amount of 3D NAND into our broad product base. So we're going to apply it where it gives us most value first, which are our higher density applications or products. So you can imagine what those are, both classes of SSD and certain classes of off-embedded will benefit directly from that. So our ability to bring those products into the market sooner and at higher volume is the general way to think about that.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Great. And I just wanted congratulate Olivier and best of luck in his next endeavor.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mehdi.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Steve and Mike, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the underlying business patterns for both SSD and HDD. Especially, Steve, given your comment around the 110 million TAM for September. Can you talk about the puts and takes in terms of where maybe you're seeing some signs of life and renewal of the TAM (40:32) versus maybe some areas of challenge? And the same thing for the SSD piece.","And then, Mark, I do appreciate the direction in the message in terms of around a more holistic reporting down the road, so we all look forward to that. I had a question though in terms of the gross margin. Could you talk a little about how we should think about the gross margin in the near to midterm? Is there any business that's going to be underperforming or out-earning before we get to the December Analyst Meeting on the margin side?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So you want to take it?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Mike can take the color on the 110 million TAM.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so just thinking about it, I think the things to think about by segment, PC growth has moderated in terms of the declines. We've seen that flatten out. That's helpful as we enter into the second half as we see normal seasonality give us a little bit of a boost. I talked already about what our thoughts are around capacity enterprise. That will continue to be an area of growth within the hard drive segment. The other area to comment on is performance enterprise. We do see that continuing to have pressure from SSD. So there's been a downward trend in that market. We expect on a year over year basis something in the 25% range.","And then lastly, gaming is up seasonally given the traditional holiday seasons, the current quarter is a high volume quarter for gaming. So that's a way to kind of dimension the HDD world. Within the broader solid state markets, I think I made reference to this in my comments. We're really seeing strong demand across all segments: embedded, client SSD, and ESSD or enterprise SSD. It's sort of as expected, but growth continues.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and just a comment on our margins, then I'll ask Mark to add a comment about a little bit about the hierarchy of our margins. But I want to impress one point, that all of our margins by product continue to perform consistent with our expectations and what we would consider to be our own internal margin ranges. So no issues in terms of that, but I'll ask Mark to talk about kind of the hierarchy of our margins.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. Mark. So basically when we look at the hierarchy of gross margin, the highest performing area for us is in the data center devices and solutions. Then that's followed by our client solutions, and then the third kind of level in the hierarchy is client devices. And as Steve pointed out, we are seeing the expected performance in each of those categories.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two for me as well.","Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hey, we can't hear you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can't hear you.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hopefully this is better.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's better.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess two questions. One, Mike, you talked about this 20% cost per bit decline as you go forward. Could you achieve that on the planer NAND side as well and would you have to go down half a node to get there in the next few quarters essentially or was that more a long-term comment you were making?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","That's a long-term commentary and it's enabled by the 3D NAND transition in both initially and then subsequent generations.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then I guess can you guys talk about the Samsung licensing revenues? Is the expectation that \u2013 SanDisk was getting that obviously \u2013 but is your expectation that that holds firm as you go forward and it gets renewed, or do you think that rolls off to a lower number at some point?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, a few clarifying comments. I mean first off, we nor SanDisk have historically disclosed the amount of the royalty from Samsung. The additional thing is, is that the current royalty arrangement is up for renewal and we're in discussions with Samsung regarding the terms of that renewal. I have nothing to report in terms of the status of that other than we're currently discussions with them. And then the additional point that I will make, which we talked about as part of the acquisition, is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were I will call it relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought, so we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from a future financial modeling perspective.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Hey, something a little mundane. Tax rate going forward, I know you guided to 20% to 25% for fiscal 2017 and 10% to 15% for fiscal 2018. Is that still what your thinking is, or can you narrow that range a little for us?","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","Well, as we pointed out, we will be providing a much more fulsome financial model at our Analyst Day in December. But I think it's safe to assume that the ranges we provided for the guidance will actually be slightly lower. And for fiscal 2017, we think it will be something in the range of 15% to 20%.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about your plans for production capacity going forward, especially in light of the TAM going up again next quarter. How should we think about where the industry capacity and specifically your capacity needs go particularly as we exit 2017 if there could be more pressure on PC units in particular? Are we thinking that may be going down to a 45 million sort of capacity level for you is something that could be additive to the cost synergies out there as well?","And then again a related cost question, but on the SanDisk side. If we got the OpEx numbers right for WD standalone, it seems like the guidance for next quarter implies that the SanDisk OpEx is going up. I just wanted to see if you can provide a little bit more color on that. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so one of the things that \u2013 the first question has to do with HDD capacity, so just to comment on that. One of the things that Mike said, we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out both in the form of brick and mortar as well as in terms of head count to react to the decline that we have seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our head count over the course of the last two years. We also have, we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to one third and when you look at from two years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can.","Obviously our margins in terms of what we reported on the hard drive sides shows that we have done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx, but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior for fiscal Q4. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. Is there anything you can offer on free cash expectations for 2017 after doing a little over $100 million last quarter? And with that, anything to offer as far as your thoughts behind the projected debt paydown schedule? Even qualitatively would be great. Thanks.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","So in terms of free cash flow, we're going to provide updated guidance in December. So I think that's the soonest we'll give you more granularity.","But in terms of our debt paydown schedule, I think it's safe to assume we're going to be aggressive where we can be to pay that down as quickly as we can. Our long-term commitment remains the three to five-year horizon getting to 1.5 times leverage. And as I mentioned, as we can find ways, whether it's our cash conversion cycle or other operational improvements that generate more free cash flow, we will look to use that to delever the balance sheet.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then quickly on the legacy hard drive business, apologize if this was covered already, but the gap up in consumer units during the quarter, what drove that?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The gap up. What do you mean by gap up?","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","I think it went from 7 million units to 10 million sequentially, big sequential move. I must have the wrong numbers.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure what you're referring to.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Consumer HDD is 7.3 million in the March quarter, 10 million in the June quarter.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So that would be gaming.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Gaming. It's all gaming.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ana Goshko with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks very much. First I wanted to clarify, on the CapEx guidance ranges that you gave, that includes incremental contributions into the flash JVs. Is that true?","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Yes, it does. That's our cash CapEx range that we provided.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then in the quarter, it looks like there was a $90 million contribution. What's the expectation on the SanDisk side for the CapEx that's at SanDisk proper? And how much do you expect to contribute into the JV going forward?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would be implied in that 6% to 8%. Beyond that, we won't be providing specifics.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then secondly, I think the largest piece of the synergy case between the SanDisk\/Western combination was the vertical integration on the NAND supply side. And I wanted to get an update on when you think you'll be able to start realizing that.","Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think as we stated, we're going to do that through product life cycle adjustments. So we are not going to retroactively go back to existing products shipping to customers. So that's going to happen over the course of time. And really largely sort of 18 months and beyond we'll start to see that take more effect.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then this may be mundane, but I don't know if I caught a depreciation and amort projection for this coming quarter.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't believe that we provided one.","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","We did not.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Can I get one?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. Thank you, then.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is now open.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Anything on the long awaited transition to energy assisted magnetic recording? Is that 2017, or that keeps on getting pushed out?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say it's 2018, 2019 kind of dynamic.","Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Okay. So it's fallen out. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please check your mute button, Vijay.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hey. Sorry about that. Just on the OpEx level, where do you see the long-term OpEx level? I know it's $875 million here. Where do you see it longer term?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's an additional item that we'll be providing more color on in December. We're still scrubbing through the details.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And on the gross margin line, what are the puts and takes as you look out? What drives it? Where do you see upside coming from as we look out couple of quarters here?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well that's a very general question. And so, again, we'll be providing more information in December in terms of our gross margin range. But obviously the puts and takes, it's going to be dependent upon the usual things, what happens with mix, what happens with pricing, what happens with demand. Obviously right now in terms of what Mike was alluding to, we've got a favorable supply\/demand situation in terms of NAND. That's helping our margin profile from an overall perspective. And hard drive market is relatively stable, certainly from a demand perspective.","But as Mike alluded to, we continue to see some share-based pricing behavior in certain parts of the market that's kind of offsetting maybe some of the more positive things that we're seeing in terms of mix and demand on the hard drive side. So there's various different puts and takes. But on balance, we see at least in the near term an upward trajectory from 31% to 32% in terms of our gross margin percentage.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","All right. And just last question here on the yen. I might have missed the first part of that, but were you mentioning the unrealized hedging gains in the yen? Do you expect that to \u2013 does that flow through the EPS line in coming quarters or how do you see that $35 million (sic) [$26 million] (56:01) and $17 million in [indiscernible] (56:07)?","Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer","So first of all, let me clarify. That is just purchase accounting. So it will not flow through the P&L for Q1 and Q2 and beyond for the instruments that we had at the time of the closing of the transaction. So all our new hedging instruments will flow through in the customary manner. Now, we still get the cash benefit of those instruments, but you will see effectively it's what would otherwise have been a decrease in the next few quarters as a result of that purchase accounting requirement.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Best of luck. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask you about the operating expenses in the fourth quarter? Because combined, those were about $484 million. In the coming quarter, you've guided to $875 million. So what were the unusual charges or if any, within those two line items.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing unusual. And again, the complexity with the guide is you compare a full quarter with a quarter not including obviously SanDisk for the full period. And as we indicated earlier, the incentive compensation now will be fully funded, which wasn't the case before. So the reconciliation is a bit tricky. But nothing out of the ordinary.","David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So the current quarter was $484 million of op expenses including $70 million of stock comp. And so the next quarter will be $875 million, and I guess we'll have a lower component of stock comp.","Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So stock-based compensation is excluded from all the numbers we are communicated.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's included. You'll have a full quarter, so it will actually be higher stock comp. We'll repeat the answer. The primary difference between F Q4 and F Q1 OpEx is having a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx plus a higher level of incentive compensation funding. That's the primary difference.","David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","But wouldn't that be \u2013 so that should be a bigger number than a smaller number. Isn't that? What am I missing?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll have to take this offline, okay?","David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. The exabytes shipped, does that include the NAND flash component now?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Repeat that. I'm sorry.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","The exabytes shipped, the 66.1 in the June quarter, does that include the NAND flash shipments as well?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","It does. Okay. So there was an acceleration on a year over year growth, so is that primarily attributable to the inclusion of NAND flash?","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It would be primarily driven by capacity enterprise shipments.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is that you had about $100 million upside relative to the original midpoint guidance. And given the ASP uptick, which I think is due to the mix shift to the capacity enterprise, it sounds like it was largely capacity enterprise that drove all this. And could you give some additional color as far as where that demand from capacity enterprise was? It sounds like it's hyperscale, but just want to make sure it's just hyperscale and there's no upside from the enterprise storage OEMs as well.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, just to make an overall comment, because remember we provided guidance prior to the acquisition of the SanDisk, which SanDisk which was obviously legacy WDC. Our financial results for F Q4 for legacy WDC came in largely consistent with our expectations. So primarily the upside that we saw was driven by if you want to call it legacy SanDisk or our new flash-based business over that stub period.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","I see. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. All right. So I want to thank you for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank Olivier Leonetti for his contributions as our Chief Financial Officer over the last two years. We greatly appreciate Olivier's dedication during this transformative time and wish him the best in the future. We look forward to staying in touch with our investors in the analyst community in the weeks and months ahead.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.","Peter Andrew","Thank you and good afternoon. Before we begin, I would like to everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook, based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.","Steve Milligan","Thank you, Peter and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.","We ended fiscal 2019 with a significantly expanded market presence in both capacity enterprise and client SSDs and began building momentum for our enterprise SSDs. The Western Digital team maintained its focus on execution, further improved operational efficiency and delivered the strongest product portfolio in the company's history. We accomplished all of this in the midst of various challenges on both the market and geopolitical fronts.","In hard drives, we continue to focus on the higher growth, higher margin portion of the market, namely capacity enterprise. Our technology leadership demonstrated by our 14-terabyte drive combined with the breadth of our portfolio across a range of capacities enabled us to gain market share. In flash, we doubled our client SSD exabyte shipments due to the strength of our portfolio.","I'm also pleased that our latest enterprise NVMe product is commencing its revenue ramp in the current quarter at both major hyper scale and OEM customers, positioning us for strong growth in this area in fiscal 2020 and beyond. In May, we announced a formal agreement with our flash JV partner, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to jointly invest in the K1 fab. This new facility will provide needed space for the continued transition to future 3D flash technologies.","On the cost front, we accelerated the streamlining of our hard drive manufacturing footprint. We also made significant progress in lowering our operating expenses, and Bob will provide additional details. In terms of our June quarter performance, overall results were within the expectations we provided in April. In hard drives, the ongoing customer transition to our 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive drove meaningful sequential revenue growth.","In flash, revenue declined sequentially as an improved product mix was more than offset by weak pricing. Our expectation for a stronger demand environment for the second half of calendar year 2019 remains intact for both our flash and hard drive products.","Before I hand the call over to Mike, I want to provide some comments on three additional topics, Huawei, the Yokkaichi JV fabs and flash inventory. Effective May 16, the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security or BIS added Huawei to its entity list. Western Digital stopped shipments to Huawei at that time. After discussions with the Commerce Department on the relevant laws and regulations, we determined that the entity list regulations do not apply to products that were previously qualified for Huawei and we started resuming shipments of those products to Huawei in mid-June. Western Digital's business activities that are subject to the entity list restrictions remain on hold. But we have applied for the BIS for a license to resume those activities.","Turning to the Yokkaichi fabs, an unexpected power outage occurred on June 15, affecting production operations at the flash fabrication facilities operated by TMC. Since that event, the Western Digital and TMC teams have worked diligently on recovery activities. And as of now, nearly all of the equipment in the fabs has returned to normal operations. Consistent with our prior comments, the disruption to fab operations caused a loss of approximately 6 exabytes of wafer output for Western Digital, with most of the wafer output impact expected to be contained in the September quarter.","As Mike will explain, we anticipate we will be able to largely mitigate any revenue impact for the September and December quarters. With respect to flash inventory, based on recent industry announcements, and a stronger demand environment, we estimate that any excess inventory will be substantially reduced by the end of this calendar year. It's still too early to characterize it as a trend, but we are seeing a more stable pricing environment for our flash business.","In summary, we are successfully navigating dynamic market conditions. Our hard drive business is performing well and we believe that the flash market has reached a cyclical trough. The secular trends of data growth and its increasing value, key drivers of our business opportunities are strong. Our continued transformation into a data infrastructure company is on solid footing and we look forward to reporting on our progress. I want to thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support.","With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.","Mike Cordano","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. I'd like to begin by amplifying Steve's perspectives on fiscal 2019. We made significant strides in broadening and strengthening our product portfolio, particularly in capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, client SSDs and embedded products, while maintaining our strength in our retail offerings. ","In fiscal 2019, we expanded our lead in aerial density and established the 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive as an industry standard. We were the first to announce the 16 and 18 terabyte products based on our energy assisted recording technology. In flash, we\u2019re the first to successfully commercialize our 96 layer 3D technology across a range of products. And we will continue to implement it across the rest of our portfolio in the remainder of calendar 2019.","Moving to highlights for the June quarter. In Data Center Devices and Solutions, a broad adoption of our new capacity enterprise products drove a mid-single digit year-over-year exabyte shipment growth for the first half of calendar 2019, outpacing industry growth resulting in exabyte share gain. Coupled with our continuing expectation for stronger demand in the second half of calendar 2019, we have high confidence that our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth will meaningfully exceed 30% for this calendar year.","With this strong demand, we are seeing some signs of supply constraints within our capacity enterprise product portfolio. Our 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive qualification activities are complete at virtually all hyper scale and OEM customers. And the accelerating adoption of this higher capacity drive further extended our leadership in this category. There have been some market rumors suggesting that customers are skipping the 14 terabyte generation to adopt the 16 terabyte capacity point, but our demonstrated performance with our 14 terabyte offering should invalidate those claims.","In addition, we're on track to introduce our first energy assisted recording 16 terabyte CMR and 18 terabyte SMR hard drives later this calendar year. In enterprise SSDs, I'm pleased that our internally developed NVMe platform is commencing revenue ramp at hyperscale and OEM customers in the current quarter. Next week at the Flash Memory Summit, we will be announcing additional enterprise NVMe products, implemented with BiCS4. We expect a significant acceleration of our enterprise NVMe product revenues over the course of fiscal 2020 and beyond.","Within Client Devices, surveillance continues to be a long term driver for client HDDs. We are leading the transition in this area to drive managed SMR. In the September quarter, we expect to see a strong revenue ramp of our drive managed SMR products, allowing us to meaningfully participate with compelling surveillance portfolio. For client SSDs, shipments of our NVMe based products grew significantly, representing nearly 50% of our client SSD revenue. As price points have declined, we are seeing customers migrating to higher capacity points and the average capacity per unit of our client SSDs increased 50% on a year-over-year basis. ","In Client Solutions, we are very pleased with our continuing success in the external SSD category with further expansion in our market share. Average capacity per unit for flash devices -- I'm sorry. In mobile and embedded, we continue to strengthen our product portfolio, including the announcement of a 3D NAND grade product, broadening our automotive offering with unique capacities and capabilities. Due to market conditions and geopolitical dynamics, we reduced our participation in mobile during the June quarter and expect to see immediate recovery of our participation in mobile in the September quarter.","I would now like to make a comment on Huawei. As Steve described previously, we stopped shipments to Huawei for about a month, having subsequently resumed shipments. As a result of the stoppage, we estimate there was approximately $100 million revenue impact in the June quarter. In addition, given the ongoing uncertainties, our near term opportunities at Huawei have been reduced.","In Client Solutions, we were very pleased with our continuing success in the external SSD category with further expansion in our market share. Average capacity per unit for flash devices grew 36% year-over-year. The power of our brand and our customers\u2019 preference for their performance and reliability of our solution allowed us to maintain our leadership position.","From a flash supply perspective, as Steve mentioned, the JV fabs have essentially resumed normal operations. I will share a few additional details on the impact of the fab power outage and Bob will provide the financial implications. ","We anticipate the incident will result in a reduction of Western Digital's flash wafer availability of approximately 6 exabytes, consistent with our prior estimates. For the balance of calendar 2019, given constrained supply, we're working closely with our customers to align to their increasing demand. For calendar 2019, we estimate industry flash supply growth in the, low 20% range.","Turning to flash technology, the ramp of BiCS4, our 96 layer 3D flash technology is progressing well and we expect bit crossover exiting the September quarter. We expect to ship BiCS4 technology offerings in each of our product lines before the end of calendar 2019. Looking beyond the normal course of business, we're driving an important industry level initiative called Zoned Storage. This approach is an open source standards based initiative, which was formally announced in June and will be further discussed and demonstrated with the flash memory summit next week.","From a customer perspective, the key benefits of Zoned Storage include lower total cost of ownership, intelligent data placement, and greater economies of scale for applications such as video, artificial intelligence, machine learning and IoT. Zoned Storage will utilize a combination of SMR hard drives and NVMe SSDs, including QLC offerings. The Zoned Storage initiative brings together our deep expertise in both the underlying storage and system level technologies and is a great example of what the power of our portfolio can deliver for our customers.","In summary, we are entering the new fiscal year with a significantly enhanced product portfolio, leaner cost and expense structure and a persistent drive to address and capture the opportunities presented by the growth in and increasing value of data. The Western Digital platform continues to strengthen and combined with our ongoing focus on execution, we're positioned to perform well in a variety of market conditions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob for the financial discussion.","Bob Eulau","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that results for the June quarter were in line with our expectations provided in April. Revenue for the June quarter was $3.6 billion, down slightly from the March quarter. On a sequential basis, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 2%, as we experienced continued strength in capacity enterprise drives. Client Devices revenue declined slightly, as growth in the client SSD market was offset by declines in the client HDD and flash mobile applications.","Client Solutions revenue decreased 6% primarily due to lower flash pricing. In the June quarter, flash revenue was $1.5 billion, with a 1% sequential decline in bits and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte decline of 6%. Hard drive revenue of $2.1 billion was up 3% sequentially, led by strong demand for capacity enterprise drives.","Moving on to costs and expenses. All of my comments will be related to the non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the June quarter was 24.2%, with a flash gross margin of 19%, and a hard drive gross margin of 28%. Hard drive gross margins were slightly below expectations due to surveillance and desktop margin declines offsetting improved margin in capacity enterprise drives. Hard drive gross margins will show the full benefits in the December quarter from our previously discussed closure of the Kuala Lumpur facility. ","Excluded from the cost of revenue was a final $67 million charge related to the planned underutilization of our portion of the flash joint venture fab, bringing an end to this program that we announced in late calendar 2018. This quarter, we took a GAAP only charge of $145 million to cost of revenue for the unexpected power outage that impacted equipment and operations in the Yokkaichi flash manufacturing facility. We expect to incur an additional charge in the range of $170 million to $190 million in the September quarter related to this event.","We and our partner will be vigorously pursuing recovery of our losses associated with this event. Operating expenses were $722 million, at the low end of our guidance as a result of continued progress on our expense reduction targets. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $169 million and free cash flow was negative $179 million. In the June quarter, we paid $146 million in dividends to our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and our gross debt outstanding was $10.7 billion.","Our liquidity position continues to be very strong with the cash and cash equivalents I just mentioned and the $2.25 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. I have no concern regarding our debt covenants, especially given the amendments made to the credit agreement in April. As we generate free cash flow going forward, our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long term shareholder value. After paying our dividend, our next priority with our free cash flow will be to reduce our gross leverage.","Inventory dollars were down approximately $160 million sequentially to $3.3 billion. Hard drive inventory decreased due to the drawdown of inventory built to enable the Kuala Lumpur facility closure. Flash inventory also decreased, primarily due to scrap of work-in process inventory at the fab as a result of the power outage. We expect both flash and hard drive inventories to decline further in the September quarter.","Now, I will provide our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a non-GAAP basis. Please note that the September quarter will be a 14 week period. We expect revenues to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 24% to 25%. Please note that this range includes approximately $50 million of startup costs associated with our investment in the K1 fab.","We're on track with our previously announced difference to lower cost of revenue by $100 million per quarter by the end of the December quarter. Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million on a 14 week basis. We're on track with our original target to reach $740 million in the September quarter on a 13 week basis. The 14th week will add approximately $45 million of operating expenses in the September quarter. ","We expect interest and other expense of approximately $95 million and we expect the tax rate to be 27% plus or minus two points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share of between $0.15 and $0.35, assuming approximately 300 million in fully diluted shares. For those of you who've worked with me in the past, you know that prudent cash management has all always been one of my key areas of focus. ","Total cash, capital expenditures at Western Digital include the cash CapEx on our balance sheet, along with the net change in notes receivable for our flash joint ventures. For fiscal 2020, our preliminary estimate for total cash capital expenditures is less than $500 million, which is a significant reduction from the $1.36 billion spent in fiscal 2019. The key drivers for the reduction in total cash capital expenditures are the previously announced planned slowdown in our capital deployment, the timing on the payment for capital equipment and an anticipated increase in lease financing for the flash JVs.","Before I turn over the call to the operator, I would like to note that I'm very excited about the company's position as we enter the new fiscal year. For me, personally, it is a great time to be at Western Digital. We clearly have momentum in the capacity enterprise part of our HDD business. And in Flash, we are successfully ramping our NVMe platforms for client and enterprise applications, while maintaining our strong retail presence. There are signs that market conditions in Flash have reached the cyclical trough, and we are now entering the seasonally stronger part of the calendar year. My goal is to ensure that we maintain financial discipline to deliver the best business results as we look into the future.","With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Two if I can, real quick. So first of all, underpinning your gross margin assumption for the current quarter, I'm just hoping that you can provide us with a little bit more granularity of how we should think about the trajectory of the hard disc drive gross margin given that that was relatively weak, I think versus expectations in this last quarter. And then how do we think about the gross margin on the flash business, not just for this current quarter, but as we start to see kind of the cyclical trough story play out, how we think about the gross margin, moving higher over the next couple of quarters?","And then I do have a follow up.","Steve Milligan","Yeah. So Aaron, I'll address that and then Mike and Bob can add a little bit of color. In terms of HDD gross margins, if you go back historically, I know you're well familiar with us, Aaron, that we would normally expect our gross margins to be in the low kind of 30% range, say 31%, 32%. So we're operating below where we'd like to be. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of this year, and certainly into 2020, we would see our gross margins begin to move more back into that range. And so that's kind of our expectation from that standpoint.","Flash, I would say that, will be similar performance, maybe slightly down to -- it kind of hard. But range, let's say roughly similar to where we're at right now, a lot of that's going to depend upon the pricing environment. And we're seeing a more stable pricing environment from what we've seen over the last several quarters. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of fiscal 2020, we will see an improving gross margin profile on our flash business as well.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And Aaron, let me just add, and Bob mentioned this. So in our desktop category, so the so the drag in the quarter just reported is really we're in the midst of a product transition on desktop and surveillance. So that was a drag to HDD margin. And just to reiterate what Steve said, we expect to see trending up sequential HD margin in the back half of this year and beyond. ","Steve Milligan","I\u2019d just add one thing. The other thing I mentioned is on the flash side, we are expecting improvement, but we do have a headwind of the K1 startup costs, which we saw some in the fourth quarter, will see again in the first quarter and throughout this fiscal year.","Aaron Rakers","Very helpful. And then just as a real quick follow-up on the flash business, I think, one of the notable things that differs in your results here tonight is kind of the capacity shipment number down 1% on a sequential basis. First, I think Hynix and Samsung were like 30% or 40%. So I'm curious of how you think about that differential. Is it Huawei driven? Is it your lack of participating in kind of the discrete market? And what is your expectation as far as bit growth into the September quarter? Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so as I talked about in my script, Aaron, this has really impacted the mobile category. And it's both some impact to the geopolitical activity, but also some choices around business that we didn't see was favorable from a profitability standpoint or lower ASP. So the two of those drove the bit shipment delta on our side. And obviously, we think we've got more interesting places to spend our bits as we progress through the calendar year.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And Aaron, I mean, you can -- you'll notice this as well, our sequential ASP decline in the flash area was meaningfully lower than other\u2019s reported numbers which there's a direct correlation in terms of that data point, and our participation in the mobile segment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","A quick one for Bob, the tax rate that you're forecasting here in Q1 is quite high. How should we be -- what is driving that tax rate for the quarter, and how should we think about modeling that for the rest of the year? And I have a follow up.","Bob Eulau","Yeah. Thanks Wamsi for the question. So actually, at the beginning of year, what we do is we forecast the tax rate that we're going to experience for the fiscal year. And we actually have a very good setup here as our profit improves. But right now, given where our profitability is at, we have certain minimum tax payments that we have to make in some jurisdictions around the world, so that's why the rate is somewhat inflated as our profitability improves, as we move forward, we're expecting the rate to come down.","Wamsi Mohan","And then more broadly, you've noted this on a more positive tone around the demand environment. Can you address a little bit more specifically, what specific areas you're seeing signs of demand for EU. And just a follow up quick one on Huawei as well. You said there might have been about 100 million of lost sales here for the stoppage of shipments for a month, but as you resume shipments, it sounded like you're not doing that at your flow rate. So at what rate are you expecting to be shipping in the September quarter, relative to maybe the anticipated reduction that you\u2019re foreseeing here?","Steve Milligan","Okay, on an overall basis, I think the way we look at end market growth, certainly we see strength in data center across both HDD and flash, as we get into the back half of the year. We think there's growth possibilities, both at the market level and specifically for us. We also see continued resilience and normal, cyclical demand flowing through the historical PC category. So we see that trend continuing to be good, both in terms of unit demand, but also in terms of capacity mix of that demand. And generally speaking, mobile is on a relative basis, stronger in the second half than it was in the first half. So I think that's the general theme. So we do see normal seasonality across markets that tend to behave that way. And then obviously, the data center is continuing to show robust capital spending expectations moving forward.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And the relative the Huawei, we have resumed shipment, as we noted in the prepared remarks. But during the time when we see shipment to Huawei, they moved their sourcing requirements to some of our international competitors that were not impacted by the entity list and so when we subsequently resumed shipment, it was at a reduced rate that contemplated them, sourcing components from other competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","If I'm doing the math correctly, so your full year industry outlook for capacity, enterprise HDD, exabytes shipment growth of 30%. That implies about 60% year-over-year -- 60% petabyte consumption in the second half versus the first half. That's very strong acceleration in the second half. First of all, is this about right. And this implies strong capacity enterprise shipments in the second half. Secondly is, the cloud data center, strong uptake, pretty broad based across most of the large US cloud and hyperscale guys or limited just to few.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so I think you're about right. And that's really reflective of our growth. We do see general strength in the market, but I think we're growing at a faster rate than the rest of the market.","Bob Eulau","Yeah. So the 30% that we were talking about was our growth, not necessarily industry.","Steve Milligan","Correct. But your math is on, if you look at half to half comparison.","Bob Eulau","60-40 is consistent with our math.","Harlan Sur","Got it. Okay. And I appreciate that good traction in the 14 terabyte. On enterprise NVMe commencing revenue ramp this quarter, good to see the initial design win traction, when will the higher margin profile of these products start to show up as a mix related gross margin impact, is it December quarter you think? Is it more first half of next calendar year?","Steve Milligan","Yeah, I think there's some positive impact in the December quarter and it will sort of accelerate as we move forward.","Bob Eulau","Yeah. And the other thing is that, putting aside what it'll do to margins, it also allows us to diversify and de-risk our placement of bits going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","Thanks for letting me ask the question. Two if I may. First, Steve or Mike, you've made great progress on transitioning to 96 layer 3 NAND. And you indicated in your prepared remarks that client SSD capacity rose 50% year-over-year. I guess I'd like to ask how you think philosophically about your consumer hard disk drive businesses relative to your client SSD businesses, now that NAND prices have effectively been cut in half on a year-over-year basis and NAND demand electricity, as you called out is making SSDs much more economical today.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so I think -- the way we think about that, and I think it's essential to Huawei combine these assets, there will be reasonably long tail on client HD assets, both 2.5 and 3.5. But what we've seen as we move back into this pricing regime is this sort of continued predicted penetration of SSDs into what was historically the HD part of the PC market. So that continues sort of as planned. Obviously, with the adjustment we made in our manufacturing footprint, was in recognition of that. So I think from our standpoint, things are generally progressing as planned. And we're well situated to take advantage of that shift from one to the other, maintaining sort of the profit delivery of the HDD business as it moves into its later stages within the PC segment, but grow within the SSD transition on the other side.","Karl Ackerman","I guess, as my follow-up question, regarding your NAND industry bit supply assumption of low-20s, I assume that's a production number. But how should we think about your own bit supply number, which I guess I would imagine would be mid-30s or higher? And as in relation to that, I'm curious how we think about idling wafer capacity and going after receiving market share in certain areas, mobile, as we described earlier, when some of the South Korean peers appear to be going after share near term? I guess, how should we think about the longer term implications of that in regards to our cost structure?","Steve Milligan","Yeah. So I think one of the things to think about is we focus very carefully on relative capacity share. I think we remain in a quite competitive position. The short term decisions we\u2019ll make based upon sort of economic and current market conditions we see is more tertiary. Right. So ultimately, we were comfortable with the decision we made several quarters ago to run underutilized that brought us into the middle of the year with a better overall inventory position than we would have otherwise had. And ultimately, we're able to place our bets in a way that gives us a better overall economic outcome.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And I would just -- to quibble a little bit with your choice of wording, I would not say that we seeded market share in the mobile market, we determine that at the prices that were in effect, it did not make economic sense to take that business. And so it was an economic decision that went into that as opposed to the seeding of market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess a bit of a follow-up question. Not sure I completely understood. I believe on the NAND bit growth outlook for calendar \u201819 across the board, we've heard 30 plus percent from your three major competitors. And you guys are talking low-20. So is the low-20s what you expect to ship this year that's production. And as part of that, if in fact, you are growing less than the industry, can you speak to how you're going to focus those bits? And what are the implications we should be thinking about due to NAND gross margins?","Bob Eulau","Yeah, so let me clarify both, the 20% and the 30%. If we look at the consumption of bits by our customers, and this is an industry statement, it would be in that 30% range. Well, we're talking about the 20%. That is our estimate of industry growth and supply. The difference between the 30% and the 20% is consumption of industry inventory, which we estimate will be largely back in balance, as we exit this calendar year.","C.J. Muse","And you're talking industry inventory downstream or on bit maker books?","Bob Eulau","Industry in the supply chain, whether it's inventory on ours and our competitors\u2019 books, or if inventory that was built up either in the channel or at our customers.","C.J. Muse","So I guess as we model you guys through the second half of the year, we should be thinking about your bit shipments to revenue in the low 30s range of the low 20s range.","Mike Cordano","Yeah, so you should think about us in the low-30s range.","C.J. Muse","And then I guess as my follow up, as you think about just short term for the Q3 guide, I'm coming to roughly 60% of the incremental revenue growth coming from NAND, is that fairly accurate?","Steve Milligan","We're going to see growth in both hard drive and in NAND. I don't know if we\u2019re going to get too specific on the markets, but it's going to show good growth in both areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","I have a couple of follow ups. It\u2019s actually encouraging to hear cycle bottoming. And I think demand for -- is going to be volatile. But it seems to me that you have a better control of the cost. So if I were to hypothesize and assume that, ASPs would just be flat, NAND ASPs flat, how should I think about your ability to expand NAND margin, and I'm not asking for a specific margin target, I'm just trying to understand, a, the mix of business that you're pursuing, especially given your preference on high margin business, and b, how the 96 layer 3D NAND is going to impact your cost. So any color on margin expansion, assuming the prices will be flat in \u201820 will be great.","And I have a follow up?","Steve Milligan","This is Steve. Let me address that in a broader sense. We expect, as we move through fiscal 2020 that our gross margins for both hard drives and flash will improve, resulting in increasing earnings as we move through fiscal 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","We just have to wait and see how the supply and demand dynamics would impact pricing to have a better sense of gross margin, would that be fair?","Steve Milligan","Yes, in a literal sense. But asset with a specific dynamics are, we expect that our gross margins will continue to improve for both hard drives and flash as we move through fiscal 2020. Also, with the expense reductions and other things that we would see an increasing and improving EPS performance as we move through fiscal 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And just a follow-up question for Bob. We've had two consecutive quarter of negative free cash flow, how does it evolve into the second half of the calendar year and given your conservative CapEx and improving margin profile, should we expect free cash flow growth accelerate into the new calendar year?","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so good question and we're very focused on cash generation right now. And I do expect we'll see improvement. We're not going to give a forecast for free cash flow for next year. But we're definitely expecting to generate cash. And as I mentioned, there are some timing benefits for us with respect to CapEx next year. So I think it'll be a pretty good cash generation year.","Unidentified Analyst","Would it be kind of breakeven at the worst case into the second half of the year?","Steve Milligan","I would say definitely a worst case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Two questions from me as well. First of all, just getting back to the mix issue. Is it reasonable to assume, given some of the positive product developments you talked about on the opening that you start to see gross margin benefits from mix, as you get maybe into the second or third fiscal quarter of this year? And where we might see that in HDDs and NAND. So, then I had a quick follow up.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. So let me talk about flash. So I think it is reasonable to assume that on every -- on a normalized basis, our flash margin mix will help us on the margin rate. Obviously, to the comment Steve made, we expect the overall margin rate on flash and HDD to continue to migrate in a positive direction through the year. Same goes for HDD, as the capacity enterprise becomes an increasingly large part of our output, we see an upward trend on mix as it affects market.","Steven Fox","And then just following on that answer on the HDD side with the 14 TB ramp now going pretty strong, do we think about average capacity per drive, maybe reaccelerating, especially as you get into \u201816 and \u201918 TBs or do we look back at how it's been over the last 18 to 24 months as a guide for going forward?","Mike Cordano","I think we're going to see sort of, our long term sort of rate is 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We obviously have seen a down year this year, but we expect to return over time to roughly that 40% annualized growth.","Steve Milligan","And that's capacity enterprise, Steven.","Steven Fox","And that's including, based on what you're seeing in terms of your own product development, say which is beyond a year.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. Now, yes, and that is a industry number. And obviously, our performance at least in the short term, we're out performing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Just wondering on your NAND side, what\u2019s the split of 64 to 96 layer and, especially exiting the year?","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so we talked about that in my prepared remarks. Big crossover happens as we exit this quarter in September. That\u2019s the 96 layer. So the total bit output crossover point happens in n September.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And just to clarify, I think you mentioned CapEx, cash CapEx goes to 500 million for fiscal \u201820 from 1.5 billion in fiscal \u201819. Is that correct and do you think that will impact any of your bit supply or transitions as you go into fiscal \u201820?","Mike Cordano","Yeah, I don't think it's going to impact our production volumes at all. As I mentioned, we are going to benefit from the timing of the capital deployment next year. So we'll have the capital deployed, and we're not expecting to pay for all of it within the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Munjal Shah with UBS.","Munjal Shah","Just two go real quick. First, on the Data Center Solutions business. If you look at it sequentially, revenues were up only 2%, while capacity enterprise was really strong. I was just wondering if there were any offsets in that business where revenue could be stronger.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. So I think the offset is to some modest degree, enterprise SSD, which as we discussed, will resume growth in the back half of the calendar year, first half of the fiscal year.","Munjal Shah","And then the second question on the NAND side, as your supply comes on from the Yokkaichi fab and it comes back fully, do you think you'll be equally -- you'll be able to place this everywhere or would you still be?","Steve Milligan","We expect that we will have sufficient demand for the bits that we will be generating this quarter and beyond in the near term. We expect to be fully sold out in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Two if I could, Steve and Mike. Just would love to get your updated thoughts on how you're viewing the potential for this hyperscale cycle? I think on the last call, Steve, you said you thought where you guys made remarks that you thought it would go until at least the June quarter of fiscal \u201820. But that potentially could go through the calendar year. So I would love to get your thoughts there.","And then also thoughts on maybe potentially strength of it as well, and then I have a quick follow up.","Steve Milligan","Yeah, so I think what we've talked about was, we see core strength through the end of this year, and as best we can tell into the second half of our fiscal year, so first half of calendar year. So anything beyond that is a little outside of our normal visibility.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, great. And then any context on how I guess on degree of strength?","Steve Milligan","Yeah, I think degree of strength, we sort of talked to in our guide. So we think we're going to be above the 30% growth rate this year. So it's been strengthening as the year has progressed. And I really think it's heading back towards that average of 40% year-on-year sort of growth.","Mike Cordano","Yeah. And then I don't know if that helps a little bit. But, we had been talking about second half strength in terms of hyperscale demand. I mean, frankly, since the beginning of the year, I would say that our level of conviction regarding that has remained pretty constant as we've moved through this calendar year and remains at a high level. So, we've got pretty good confidence that previous comments that we've made in that regard remain in effect.","Operator","The last question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital, before we end with a short statement by our CEO.","Mitch Steves","Very good color on the NAND bottoming here. But I just had a quick question just in terms of you cost controls, I think that one of the big questions I have is, if you have a demand environment that\u2019s similar to let's say, about a year and a half ago, do you think that you have the ability to reduce OpEx even further, meaning that the operating margin could actually exceed the prior levels when NAND pricing improves?","Bob Eulau ","Well, the team has done a lot of work in terms of getting the cost structure in place this year. And, we're, as I mentioned, going to have the cost structure we want from an OpEx standpoint in the December quarter, probably would have had it in September, had it not been for the 14th week, I don't know that we're going to see a lot of opportunity to reduce from there and continue to execute the roadmap, which we're pretty pleased with.","Mike Cordano","And one of the things I'll add a little bit of color on that, I've been around a little bit longer than Bob. So I can probably add a little bit more. But, I think, one of the things that we learned having gone through the up and down cycle of the flash cycle is that because we're expecting that things are going to improve, we talked about a cyclical trough in terms of the flash market, what we want to do is we want to drive for efficiency, as we are going through an up cycle, and not add back expenses that were previously taken out through the down cycle. That's not necessarily a promise that we will drive below this $740 million. But we're going to continue to drive for efficiency as the demand and pricing environment improves.","Mitch Steves","And then just one quick follow up related to kind of the hard disk drive business. So one of the things I understood is that the larger 16 terabyte drives take a little bit longer to build essentially, maybe an extra 30 to 60 days. So your comment about no change to kind of your data center expectations, do you guys have better visibility than you had when you were selling, let's say, 8 terabyte drives or smaller size drives or is that incorrect?","Steve Milligan","Well, in general, we have increasingly good visibility because of the evolving sort of maturity of the cloud providers. So often, just the sort of operational engagement with them gives us a better view into their plans. And of course, in some instances, we've even got commercial arrangements that give us a very good feel for their intentions. We have one particular case where we actually are paid to carry some inventory for continuity supply reasons. And that gives us a very good feel for their deployment plans. And so it's really that that allows us to do it. And as you say, as capacities grow, there isn\u2019t a lengthening lead time. So that's important for us to have, but obviously over time, we want to counter that lead time lengthening with best time improvements that help shorten our cycle time.","Steve Milligan","Alright, well, thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing our dialog. Have a great rest of the day.","Mike Cordano","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to Western Digital\u2019s First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2015. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers\u2019 responses to those offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results or expectations for the December quarter.","These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 15, 2014.","We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation\u2019s of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","The guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, sTec, VeloBit and Virident implied termination asset impairment and other charges and charges related to litigation. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","We ask participants to limit themselves today to a single question and one follow-up question during our Q&A section of the call. I also want to note the copies of remarks from this call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital\u2019s website immediately following the conclusion of the call.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter.","Olivier joined Western Digital in early September as Chief Financial Officer. He is a welcome addition to our team, with many years of global finance experience, both at Amgen and Dell. I want to thank and acknowledge our former CFO, Tim Leyden for his 24 years of leadership and served us at Western Digital and we wish him the best and his retirement starting the first of the year.","As anticipated market demand improved in the September quarter and we achieved strong revenue EPS and gross margin performance. We also continued to generate healthy cash flow. The diversified nature of our business, coupled with the ongoing secular growth in data, and our crisp execution continue to allow us to demonstrate strong and consistent financial performance, we expect this trend will continue.","For the September quarter the industry CAM came in at the higher end of expectations. This reflected quarter-over-quarter growth and capacity enterprise, client, branded and consumer electronics and stable demand in performance enterprise.","We saw the same trends in our own business, with notable strength in our client, capacity enterprise and flash platform solutions businesses. The ladder of which includes our expanding line up of enterprise class SSDs. The industry demand outlook for the December quarter reflects a modest sequential decline with moderation in client and CE partially offset by continued strength in capacity enterprise, and branded and steady demand in performance enterprise.","We believe industry supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced. Looking at our business for the December quarter, we see the same trends. Moderation in client and CE, strong momentum in branded in capacity enterprise as well as in our flash related business, and continued steadiness in performance enterprise.","As a company at the center of the storage industry, this is an exciting time for Western Digital. There is tremendous change underway and how and where value will be created. All around as the storage ecosystem is transforming with ongoing focus on how data is stored, accessed, protected and how it has been used and monetized.","All of these changes are driving a diverse set of needs for our customers, and opportunities for our company. We are working with our customers and partners to help extract more and more value from data in an innovative and cost effective manner, across our full spectrum of products.","I continue to be encouraged by our broad-based strategy both in terms of our financial results, and customer feedback. For instance, our flash platform solutions group resumed, as faster than an industry growth trajectory with revenue of $156 million for the September quarter. We remain on track to achieve accretive earnings for this business, early in calendar 2015.","Our broad lineup of high capacity hard drives, based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform, has been very well received by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale datacenter customers, including the new 8 terabyte and 10 terabyte models announced last month.","We recently shipped our one millionth WD Purple hard drive architected to address the high-growth space of security surveillance video applications. Governments\u2019 and other large organizations\u2019 increasing use of video and digital network cameras is driving a huge need for a high resolution recording.","Our enterprise customers have responded very positively to our newly announced Active Archive offering from our newly formed Elastic Storage\u00a0Group. And in the personal cloud, we continue to grow our My Cloud business with expansion in all geographies addressing consumer and prosumer markets.","Olivier will now review our first quarter results and cover our outlook for the December quarter.","Olivier Leonetti","Thank you, Steve and delighted to be part of the team. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the September quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in July.","In our business, we saw the anticipated seasonal increase in demand for client and branded products as well as strength in capacity enterprise and continued steady demand in performance enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our four to six week range.","Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $156 million in revenue related to our Flash Platforms group, which includes enterprise SSDs. As a reminder, we continue to expect that our flash related revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the industry.","We shipped a total of $64.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the seasonal improvement in client, branded and the strength in capacity enterprise. Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1% which was better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $39 million of amortization of intangibles.","Operating expenses totaled $680 million. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $638 million, excluding $42 million of amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and employee termination costs. The additional expenses to our guidance primarily relates to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights. Our net income totaled $423 million or $1.76 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $504 million or $2.10 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet, in our fourteen week quarter we generated $827 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $667 million. Our CapEx totaled $160 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $223 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.","We closed Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion of which approximately $1.2 billion was held in the U.S. I\u2019ll now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. Gross margin to be flat with the December quarter level of 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles.","R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles. A tax rate of approximately 8%, and a share count of approximately $238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.00 and $2.10 for the December quarter.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could just go through the puts and takes on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter. I would think that the client business being may be at the softer you have better mix in the quarter. So I was just trying to understand that a bit better. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan","So if you look at Sherri. This is Steve. We\u2019re going to take a small absorption had in terms of lower volumes that will be offset by favorable mix in terms of capacity enterprise and certainly we will see a little bit, client margins tend to be a little bit lower than the corporate as a general statement, but on balance things that net out to the extent that we think that our margins will be flat, quarter-on-quarter.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","Okay, thanks Steve. That\u2019s helpful. And then, it\u2019s been a while since your last Analyst Day. I wanted to see if you could provide an update on your, on priorities for cash, in terms of how much you expect to use for buybacks and your plans to increase the dividend. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan","So, we continue to be committed to the capital allocation plan that we announced back in September 2012, in terms of 50% of our free cash-flow been returned to shareholders and the rest to be \u2013 I will call it held in reserve for potential strategic opportunities, as we look at the changes that we see in the storage ecosystem, we continue to think that there are opportunities for us to \u2013 I\u2019ll say expand our footprint, in terms of the storage industry and ways that not only add value for our customers, but also add value for our shareholders.","So at present, we are sticking with that capital allocation plan; of course we periodically review that, as a part of our overall review of our strategic priorities, but at this point there is no intend to change in our capital allocation plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the early solid quarter and Olivier welcome. I guess yes two if I could I guess both on kind of datacenter and cloud, so the SSD revenue was quite strong sequentially this quarter. Could you talk to \u2013 to what degree that was related to hyper scale build out, which you guys had talked to expecting and to what degree they\u2019re related, I guess, OEM product refraction? And then I have a follow-up in that regard as well. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan","","So let me kind of opine in a broader picture. We are seeing broad based strength in terms of the broader enterprise business, both in terms of traditional customers as well as the hyperscale data center customers, both in terms of our capacity enterprise business, which we saw a nice pickup this past quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the December quarter and correspondingly we\u2019re also seeing, as you indicated, strong strength in our enterprise SSD business.","That is really, I\u2019ll call it, across the board and really speaks to the strength of our product line both in terms of \u2013 well, really across the board, performance enterprise, capacity enterprise as well as in terms of enterprise SSD. We clearly have the broadest product line in the industry and not only that. We have the broadest products that we arguably believe that we got very strong performance from a product standpoint as well. So that\u2019s being reflected in our performance as well as the build out that we\u2019re continuing to see from the customer perspective.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital","","Steve, that\u2019s really helpful context. I appreciate. And I guess just in that regard how are you guys thinking about the cadence of hyperscale deployments as we get into the first half of the year given there\u2019s a lot of, I guess, call it lack of pent-up demand coming in the second half of year? And then also, how are you guys thinking about, I don\u2019t know, the adoption kind of curve just in the enterprise, [tried and true] (ph) enterprise given that second half of the year is a heavy product cycle, second half with the OEM? Thanks.","","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. I mean we have, I\u2019ll call it, increasing visibility. Obviously, we had good visibility till the December quarter probably in terms of what we see from a demand perspective. We got increasing visibility on what\u2019s going to happen in the first part of 2015 and we believe that strength will continue from an industry perspective as well as from our perspective in the broader enterprise space through the first half of calendar 2015.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital","","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple as well. So, first of all, I want to go a little bit deeper in terms of the portfolio difference between you and Seagate. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve started this year is a pretty good adoption of your Helium drive. I think Seagate though had a very strong growth in their high capacity drives as well. Can you talk a little about the competitive landscape? What do you feel your share position is within these cloud and hyperscale guides? And then with that how you\u2019re seeing the adoption rate pickup with regard to the Helium drives?","Stephen D. Milligan","We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in terms of adoption of our Helium based drives not only in terms of 6 terabyte, but substantial interest in adoption of the 8 terabyte as well. And so, we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned particularly with the hyperscale guide, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to know exactly what our share position is? But we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re at from a customer and from a competitive product perspective recognizing the fact that Seagate is a formidable competitor, but we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned right now.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up, well, there is not a lot of questions right now with regard to MOFCOM. I think it\u2019s still obviously an important variable to consider in the model. So maybe if you can give us an update where you stand with regard to the dialogue with MOFCOM and is there any kind of updated views on expectations with regard to the timing of a decision on MOFCOM and as you\u2019re opinions or views change on a potential synergy opportunities being able to integrate Apache. Thank you.","Stephen D. Milligan","And so Aaron, no specific update that\u2019s any different than what I provided last quarter, our dialogue with MOFCOM continues. It continues to be constructive and it continues to be active. And so I was in China a couple of weeks ago and met with MOFCOM. And as I indicated, we continue to have a discussion about our situation, the process that they will use from a review perspective. I\u2019ll call parameters that they will use to evaluate our application. And so we although maybe a bit discouraged I guess you might say in terms of the timing. We are positive about our ongoing dialogue with China with the monopoly bureau.","They have not provided any indication as to specific timing. I think one of the things that we have to recognize is that the whole separate remedy that was imposed was a new remedy. It was not something that they had done before. The reapplication to have it lifted is therefore by definition also a new process and an undefined process. And the Chinese are being very deliberate with that review. We respect that. And like I said, we may be a bit frustrated in terms of we certainly would like them to move faster, but at present we continue to be encouraged by the constructive nature of our dialogue.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Helium, just wanted to understand if you had any capacity constraints and all were you able to meet all the demands for Helium drives?","Stephen D. Milligan","No capacity constraints related to our Helium-based drives.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research","Great and just separately just mathematically there seems like you may be losing a little bit of share near-term on notebooks. Just could you comment on that as skepticism you\u2019re seeing is this just a quarter-to-quarter duration or what you think?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, if you look at our share over the last several quarters, we have had the \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of been up and down maybe a point or two. If you recall last quarter or two quarters ago, so the June quarter, we gained two points in market share, this quarter we lost, I believe, about 170 basis points. So this tends to be the normal ebb and flow that occurs in our business from a share perspective.","And as was indicated yesterday on our largest competitors call, they took some incremental business or were provided some incremental business in the gaming segment that drove a reasonable amount from what we can gather of their share increase and correspondingly drove the Lion\u2019s share of our market share decline. And also you can see that that was lower margins business and perpetuated itself and our respective financial performance.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Richard Kugele with Needham Company. Your line is open","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company","Thank you and good afternoon, just a couple of questions. I guess first is close the loop on the settlement with Seagate. I assume that that payment came from offshore cash right and is there any change to how you\u2019re viewing your own capital deployment strategy to shareholders?","Stephen D. Milligan","So let me take this one. You\u2019re right; the settlement was paid out of offshore cash. And as a clarification also we distributed 50% of our free cash flow this quarter which is consistent with what we have done over the last two years. Now in the short run, exiting the recent arbitration payment from our calculation, we reserved to not exceeding our capital allocation target. And we expect our board to view this matter next week during its regular meeting and we will update you at that time.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay. And then actually in that vein, Olivier, how do you view the balance sheet and what do you think is the right type of cash balance to run the two operations as you move forward?","Olivier Leonetti","","It\u2019s a question we\u2019re asked a lot. As you can see in our balance sheet, our cash balances are strong with about $1.2 billion of cash in our U.S. bank accounts and also a leverage ratio, which is pretty low at 4.7%. As Steve indicated earlier, we believe that the current allocation, 50% of free cash flow is a good balance to reward our shareholders today, but to reward our shareholders tomorrow by keep investing in the business. So we believe where we\u2019re today \u2013 we\u2019re looking at that, but we believe it\u2019s a balanced situation.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay. And then just lastly geographically. The Americas took up nicely while Asia was down at a percentage of the total. And I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s tied into your enterprise strength as the U.S. data centers deploying a lot of high capital. Is that how we should view it?","Olivier Leonetti","That would be part of it and also it\u2019s also a brand with strong \u2013 with a lot of that business being in the U.S. So in that regard there\u2019s a bit of seasonality playing into it.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Next is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. Your flash business obviously showed some nice acceleration here, up I think almost 40% sequentially, came in number one in SAS SSD. You\u2019ve got a competitive PCIe offering. From a product perspective what\u2019s driving the pickup series? Is it both staff and PCIe? Any color here would be appreciated. And maybe just a quick update on your SATA flash strategy.","Stephen D. Milligan","","Sure. So the primary momentum that we saw in our business was related to our SAS business, and primarily driven by a refreshed product line and we\u2019re going to continue to see that momentum continue over the next few quarters. Relative to PCIe, we continue to be encouraged by that business. We have, as we indicated, had the HGST press event in September. We will have some refreshed products come out that we believe will be more competitive on the PCIe front and that will began to impact our financial results in the middle of next year.","And then, right now on the SATA front, we do not have a competitive offering in that space. We\u2019re looking at it closely and there it is primarily an economic issue. We clearly could address it from a technical capability and customer perspective, but we also want to do it in a way that generates direct kind of returns for ourselves and our shareholders.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks for that, Steve. And then as a follow-up the enterprise flash is a big market $4 billion. So obviously a lot of room for the team to go from here and as you scale this business higher, do you feel comfortable in being able to cost effectively secure NAND flash supply because it does look like suppliers are going to be fairly tight as we move through next year and potentially through 2016.","Stephen D. Milligan","At present we do. We continue to have a very strong relationship with Intel through our joint development arrangements. We\u2019ve recently talked about how that development arrangement has been extended. I believe probably for \u2013 I may have my number here wrong, but I think it\u2019s third time that we\u2019ve extended that since. We originally entered into that arrangement back in 2008. We also announced back in September again at the HGST press event that we have expanded our NAND relationship to include Toshiba as well. So we\u2019re working with them on a strategic basis as well. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the nature of our relationships in that regard, but right now we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re at.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan","Great, thanks Steve.","Operator","Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. If we look at even your Exabyte growth and even Seagate, but industry Exabyte is very strong in Q-over-Q. If we see similar trend in the disk drive industry, do you think industry could see tight situation over the next three to four quarters? And what will be the criteria if you were look at \u2013 if you\u2019re willing add any new capacity?","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure, that\u2019s something that we continue to watch closely. At present, we do not believe \u2013 well, I need to say this way, we believe that we will have adequate supply from a component perspective to meet anticipated demand, but you raised a very good point when you\u2019re talking about these high capacity enterprise drives particularly our 7 Platters Helium-filled drive. We used a lot of components, I mean 14 heads and 7 in Platter.","And so that is something that we\u2019re watching very closely. But right now, we do not anticipate that there will be a problem in meeting customer demand and nor that we believe that there will be any meaningful need to add capacity that will materially impact our stated CapEx plans. Reminding you that relative to CapEx, we have indicated that as of right now we\u2019re about 4% of revenue, we expect that that will continue at that level through the balance of this fiscal year.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Then a question on the hybrid side, Seagate kind of had a good \u2013 they shipped around three million hybrid client mainly in the quarter. Would you kind of consider the hybrid strategy at some point?","Stephen D. Milligan","No. We have a hybrid strategy, we continue to review it consistently. We are seeing some encouraging signs in that business, particularly in the client space. We are not from our perspective seeing much interest for hybrid based drives in the enterprise space. We think customers are interested in a disaggregated solution as supposed to an aggregated solution. And we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate what we\u2019re doing from a hybrid perspective, but don\u2019t from a product perspective, from a performance perspective and from an economic perspective. We are bit more muted with regards to our enthusiasm as it relates to hybrid offerings.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Okay, okay, great, thank you. I wanted to ask about join technology partnerships, Seagate announced one recently with a cloud service provider in China, recognized you guys probably have these. But just have an announcement formally, how popular are these Steve and should we expect to see more of them going forward.","Stephen D. Milligan","The answer is yes. We should expect to see more partnership kind of activity. I don\u2019t quite know how to dimension how popular they are. But with the ecosystem changing so much and it\u2019s changing in some cases in ways that are harder to predict. I mean there\u2019s a lot of evolving technologies. You\u2019ve seen us make some, and these are smaller dollars within the whole grand scheme of things. Make some investments in some storage technology related companies, enter into other kinds of partnership arrangements.","And so that kind of activity will undoubtedly increase. As we look to expand our footprint, expand the way that we can add value and clearly many of these companies given where we sit within the storage world the view us as attractive partners to work with as well.","So I think that we will continue to see that kind of activity expanding for ourselves and for others in the industry.","Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Okay. A follow-up there on the financial model. As you head down that path expanding your footprint in the systems business, should that drive gross margin up and investment on the OpEx line up over time?","Stephen D. Milligan","","We are not specifically indicating that from a model perspective. I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to keep an eye on that. We have been incrementally investing as well as reinvesting in terms of OpEx and shifting things around. But generally speaking, our OpEx levels have stayed relatively consistent from a percentage of revenue perspective.","And then, in terms of gross margin, the opportunities that we are looking at pursuing, whether they be accretive on the gross margin line or accretive on the operating income line, I mean that\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re trying to do is figure out how we can add more value from a customer perspective and if we do our jobs right best to translate to improve the economics on our income statement as well.","Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Steve, you talked about the enterprise demand strengthening in the first half of 2015. How about traditional notebook and the consumer desktop? Any comment there and to that extent if you could also discuss the pricing trend that you see beyond the December quarter. Thank you.","","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. Relative to the PC market, both in terms of notebook and desktop, and I\u2019ll address them together rather than individually. We see the PC market as I would characterize it as stable. We\u2019ve seen in terms of IDC numbers that have been published or industry forecast that have been published is PC market declining in the low single-digits. We see that continuing. We don\u2019t see either an acceleration or a deceleration from that perspective. So I would characterize the PC market as stable, which means that it\u2019s certainly much better than it has been. And there\u2019s certainly no slowdown or it\u2019s not worsening and that\u2019s a good thing from our perspective.","Relative to the March quarter or the first half of 2015, I would indicate that our visibility there is not as great as it is in the enterprise market. And so, at this point, we would simply expect that we would see the normal seasonal decline that we traditionally see for a December quarter going into March, end of the first half of the year. So that\u2019s the way we see it right now.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Great. And then any color on the pricing\u2026","Stephen D. Milligan","Pricing has been within our expectation, nothing nearly notable to call out.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Got it, thank you.","Operator","","Rob Cihra with Evercore. Your line is open.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Hi, thank you very much. I guess one \u2013 my question is a follow-up. On the enterprise SSD obviously a nice growth there. Do you had \u2013 I think Steve you\u2019d reiterated the plan to be \u2013 or the goal to be accretive following sTec and the Virident acquisitions in early calendar 2015. That would imply I would assume that business moving to become meaningfully more of a contributor to the business given the fact that the HGST, Intel SaaS, SSD is still the bulk. I mean is that the case or is that more of a cost cut gets you to the equation. What gets you the equation, I assuming it\u2019s\u2026","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, so the primary dependency is ongoing revenue growth. We are investing a certain sum of money from an OpEx perspective to make sure that we have the product \u2013 the products out there from an industry perspective but the primary dependency is to that accretive statement is ongoing momentum from a customer acceptance and revenue perspective. And we are comfortable that we\u2019re on the path that we need to be on to make the statement that we expect to be accretive on the first part of 2015.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, great. And if I guess a quick follow-up on the Helium drives. I mean are they enough contributor yet to actually make a sort of meaningful impact on your ASPs on the blended ASP in enterprise. I am assuming so, but are they big enough yet to do that? Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan","I mean that really I would paint in the context that our capacity enterprise business was a meaningful contributor to our ASP lift in this past quarter. I don\u2019t know if I want to call out the helium filled drives specifically, but it\u2019s beginning to make certainly a much more meaningful impact. I mean we\u2019re very pleased with where we\u2019re at with the adoption of our helium platform. And not only that I\u2019m very encouraged by customer reaction or anticipation to volume production in the 8 terabyte as well.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","Mark Miller with Noble financial Capital. Your line is open.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","","Well, thank you for taking my question. We talked earlier about the tightening NAND Flash environment possibility. And I\u2019m just wondering at one point there was a big campaign for relative to competitors who have internal Flash supply as Flash prices increase?","Olivier Leonetti","I\u2019m not sure I didn\u2019t follow your question Mark.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","Well, if the flash prices go up, I mean that\u2019s a percent that you build materials for your drive and I\u2019m just wondering what \u2013 how sensitive are you in terms of flash price increases, in term of your margins or your ability to transfer that to your customers?","Olivier Leonetti","Yes, I\u2019m not that concerned about that market at this point. I mean we\u2019ve been in the Enterprise SST business for a while, we\u2019ve gone through some ups and down from a pricing perspective, we certainly have a history of dealing with that in terms of variability and in terms of component cost on our base drive business historically. There\u2019s something that we have to watch and keep our eye on, but I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to deal with whatever variability exists from a component pricing perspective as it related to flash.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","And just wondering it appears that you\u2019re kind of projecting flat overall drag kind of for next year is that same reason of all?","Olivier Leonetti","We haven\u2019t provided a specific forecast for next year stand. What we have indicated is that we expect the TAM for rotating magnetic storage to increase at a low-single digits level from an unit perspective.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","And I apologize for this extra but just a housekeeping question, what was your forecast for SG&A and R&D for next quarter spending?","Olivier Leonetti","As we said \u2013 as I said in my remarks about $600 million.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","$600 million so that\u2019s down significantly from this current quarter, is that correct?","Olivier Leonetti","Correct for two reasons we had one addition week of OpEx last quarter, we had 14 week. And then the other one off incentive payment as well.","Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets","Okay. I\u2019ve Mr. \u2013 the incentive payment. Thank you.","Olivier Leonetti","No problem.","Operator","Ben Reitzes with Barclay\u2019s. Your line is open.","Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Hi, thanks a lot. Steve I wanted to ask you kind of a little more new arms around two things, you already touched on it. In terms of the December quarter guidance with the loss of the extra week, your guidance looks pretty flat up actually if I were to assume that its probably impossible to know what the extra week gave you in the quarter but if you take something off it looks pretty flattish and you were saying down. So I just wanted to see what the extra week was in your guidance and then I just had a quick follow-up?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes Ben you are right it\u2019s a little bit difficult to calibrate exactly what the impact of the extra week was last quarter. Also not to further confuse things, the December quarter is always a little bit tricky. In the sense that you have Christmas and how much activity actually takes place in the last week. So you could argue that at the 12-week quarter in the sense in terms of the December quarter. The reality of things is that most of our business is reliance shares, OEM based on and such not as transactional.","So I don\u2019t really think that the 14th week had a material impact for us we do believe that is probably slightly accretive if we were to guesstimate, but talking about December quarter I mean there will be some moderations from an overall demand perspective that we think that the demand environment as on balance. It\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s not great, certainly not bad. But it continues to be generally relatively steady.","Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay, great. And then I just open you could clarify one other thing that you said around 50% of free cash flow billing to shareholders and the other 50% joining reserve for potential opportunities. I was just wondering if you could hold that comment around potential opportunities. Did you mean more on the enterprise and flat side or do you if there is a way to holding that I mean it\u2019s really hard to say what you are going to go out and buy into, but if you are the specific, do you see it more in consumer enterprise or however you want to specify that would be great. Thanks.","Stephen D. Milligan","There are two principle opportunities that we think where we our position from a product and customer perspective to expand our footprint. One, I\u2019m clearly as in the enterprise space. If you want to call that moving us to stock and a way that is complementary to what many of our \u2013 what much of our customers are doing. And also, we do think that we have incremental opportunity in the consumer or prosumer or smaller, medium business opportunities from a storage perspective as well. So that\u2019s would be the two principle areas that we would be focusing on.","Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","","Great, thanks so much.","","Stephen D. Milligan","","So thank you again for joining us today.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in both our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers' responses to our product offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the September quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 5, 2014.","We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during the call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident, asset impairment and other charges and charges related to litigation. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","[Operator Instructions] I also want to note the copies of remarks from today's call by Steve Milligan and Tim Leyden will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter.","Western Digital achieved strong financial results in the June quarter, with better-than-anticipated revenue, healthy gross margin performance and continued strong cash flow generation. We achieved these results by addressing continued robust demand in gaming and better-than-anticipated demand in notebook PCs, demonstrating our flexibility and capability in high-volume businesses. We also saw strength in our performance enterprise business. We anticipate better demand in the second half of the calendar year as we benefit from an improving demand profile for PCs, as well as from growth in the capacity enterprise space. Our recent dialog with leading PC makers has been uniformly positive, and we are also encouraged by our ongoing interactions with data center customers.","Longer term, we remain excited about Western Digital's strong strategic position at the center of the storage ecosystem, which continues to expand, evolve and transform. The creation of digital data continues unabated, and the strategic value of that content is increasing. With our deep insight and experience, we will continue to play a vital role in unlocking the value of data with innovative and industry-leading storage devices and solutions.","We will continue to focus our investments in the highest growth areas: the public cloud and enterprise data centers, mobility and the personal cloud. Along those lines, I am pleased to note several recent achievements by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, including the expansion of our industry-leading Enterprise SAS SSD portfolio with our next-generation Ultrastar drives with capacities up to 1.6 terabytes; a new converged enterprise PCIe product roadmap following the integration of our sTec, Virident and VeloBit acquisitions; shipment of our next-generation 10K and 15K 2.5-inch performance enterprise hard drives; shipment of our third-generation WD Red product at 6 terabytes to address continued strong demand in the home and small business mass space; continued global success of our WD Purple drives in addressing the high-growth demand for security surveillance in homes and offices; and the introduction of My Book Live Duo, the newest member of our award-winning line of desktop storage solutions for the home and office, with software that provides secure local cloud and system-level backups for complete data protection. Collectively, these developments highlight our broad-based participation in the growth of data. Combined with our ongoing investments, I'm confident of Western Digital's future as a leading technology company and storage solution provider.","Tim?","Timothy M. Leyden","Thank you, Steve. Strong demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the June quarter. Continued strength in the gaming space, better-than-expected demand in notebook PCs and strength in performance enterprise countered the anticipated softness in capacity enterprise. Revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $15.1 billion, including $509 million from Enterprise SSD, which represented a 43% increase from fiscal year 2013. We continued to make progress on our journey towards a more diversified revenue mix, with 53% of our revenue coming from our branded consumer electronics and Enterprise HDD and SSD businesses.","Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion, including $113 million from Enterprise SSDs. Over the long term, we continue to expect that our SSD revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the total Enterprise SSD space. We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $56. The quarter-over-quarter decline in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the robust gaming and better-than-expected notebook volumes. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.5%, in line with our implied guidance and excluding $39 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $10 million of other charges. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $317 million or $1.32 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $445 million or $1.85 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $713 million in cash from operations in the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $552 million. For fiscal year 2014, we generated $2.8 billion in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. Our CapEx for the June quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. For the full fiscal year, our CapEx totaled $628 million, again, 4% of revenue. We expect that CapEx for the 2015 fiscal year will be at or below the low end of our 5% to 7% model.","We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $272 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 10.3 million shares for $816 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share. In total, we paid dividends of $259 million during fiscal year 2014.","We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was in the U.S.","I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion; gross margin marginally above the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of around $625 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the 14th week adds about $28 million of OpEx; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 241 million.","Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. In closing, I want to remind investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 would consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks and the second and third and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So first question for me would be just as we look at the 14-week period in the current quarter, I know you talked about operating expenses. So maybe you can help us understand what's your total TAM assumption for the industry and then also, what are you assuming as far as the contribution for your shipment numbers for that extra week in the current quarter. And I do have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Aaron, it's Steve. We -- our TAM expectation for calendar Q3 or fiscal Q1 for us is around 145 million units, kind of in that range. And we would expect that the 14th week, when you look at it on a net basis or an operating income basis, it will be modestly positive from an earnings perspective from our standpoint.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-on, I know that -- I don't know if you're going to say much at all, but just any kind of update of where we stand as far as the refiling with MOFCOM? Any kind of clarity or any expectations or any color that you can give would be helpful there.","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. Just to comment on where we're at and to refresh everybody's memory, in March of this year, we were able to reapply to MOFCOM to request that they lift the whole separate restriction on our business. That application process and review process, which MOFCOM is ongoing and continues, I don't have anything specific to comment on in terms of the status other than to comment that our dialog remains frequent with them and is constructive. And in that regard, we feel good about the direction that we're headed in terms of the dialog we're having.","Operator","Next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I also had 2 questions. Tim, perhaps if I could start with you though. If you could talk a little bit about the cash cycle. The DSOs were up quite a bit, and so your cash conversion cycle weakened significantly relative to past June quarters. If you could just talk a little bit about what drove that and where you see that going here in the current quarter. And then I have a follow-up please.","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes. I'm not sure that we can significantly -- on a cash conversion cycle basis, it was up 1 day.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Yes, sorry, the DSO is what I was referring to, excuse me.","Timothy M. Leyden","We made some progress on inventory, particularly in [indiscernible] -- we funded finished goods a bit. As far as the DSOs are concerned, that was mainly due to customer and channel mix. As you know, in the fourth quarter, it's historically been our weakest quarter, particularly for consumer and distribution and retail. So consequently, it's mainly due to just customer mix.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, okay. If I could ask my follow-up then. As it relates to pricing, could you talk about like-for-like pricing? And particularly, how you see how it was this quarter and how you see it unfolding in the September quarter please.","Timothy M. Leyden","Just a bit of background, the -- as you know, our -- the TAM was quite a bit up from where we had anticipated in our April call. And mostly, it was up in notebook and in gaming, which we've indicated historically that those are among our weakest ASPs and our weakest margins. And so pricing continues to be competitive, and there was about 60% of the delta between the 2 quarters in ASP, which was a $2 delta came from the mix and the rest of it came from price and from like-for-like pricing.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Well, I would assume to follow that the pricing mix would be favorable as we looked at the September quarter.","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes. In the September quarter, again, there's a more favorable consumer mix as we head into the holiday season. So consequently, we're expecting that it will be modestly -- there will be modestly upward momentum in the pricing in the September quarter.","Operator","Next question is from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Two if I could. The first one -- both bigger picture. The first one is with more hybrid drives being qualified as we head into the second half of the year, what is your thinking around '15 and '16 in the potential to maybe gain back or claw back some of the share that SSDs has gained in notebooks over the last few years? Love to get your thoughts there and then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. This is Steve, I'll take that question. Relative to hybrids, first thing is, is that it remains a relatively small piece of our business or low volumes from our perspective. We began to see some encouraging signs from our perspective in terms of the acceptance or utilization of hybrid drives, albeit small, still remaining small volumes. So we should see increasing volumes as we move through the back half of the year. I think it's a little bit too early to say how much that will stem the acceptance of pure -- of SSDs in the PC space. I think it's just a little bit too early to call that. We'll have to see how some of these new products that our customers are introducing, how they are received in the end-user market.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful, Steve. And as a follow-up, just with regard to the CapEx model and the comments, you said in fiscal '15, you plan to be below the low end of the 5% to 7%. What -- how should we think about your thinking with regards to moving back up into that model over the next handful of years, next couple of years and the timing of needing to add add on capacity, save TAM space stays flattish to slightly up? And how might you go about looking to finance the capacity add-ons?","Stephen D. Milligan","Right now, we continue to expect that we'll stay kind of at or below that, the 5% to 7% range. The one wildcard, frankly, that we have is what happens relative to the hold separate situation. If the hold separate gets lifted, we will then be able to rationalize our capacity across both subsidiaries, which undoubtedly would allow us to minimize capital expenditures going forward, at least for some period of rationalization. Now if that doesn't happen, we'll have to evaluate. But right now, we feel pretty good about where we're at from an overall capacity perspective. Really, the only thing that we're adding from a pure capacity perspective relates to either test capacity or some SSD activity. So I think right now, for the near future, we're going to continue to stay at that, the low end of that range or low end or below.","Operator","The next question that I'm showing comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A question on visibility. Steve, you mentioned expectations for better capacity enterprise into the second half. How has that conversation changed over the last few months?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, it's getting increasingly more positive, I guess is maybe the way to say it. I mean, one, order rates are improving, and also, the signaling that we're getting from our customers continues to be increasing or improving. So it's not -- I wouldn't characterize it as a step-function improvement in terms of volume, but we're seeing a nice steady gradual improvement in demand both in terms of actual orders booked as well as in sentiment as we move to the back half of the year.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then a similar question on visibility from PC OEMs. Has that firmed up a bit also?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, definitely. I would say that the visibility that we're seeing from a PC manufacturing perspective arguably is the best we've seen in quite a while. I would anticipate that we will continue to see strength in the PC market through the balance of 2014, and we are increasingly optimistic that, that will carry in at least in terms of the first half of 2015.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. I wanted to dive a little deeper on the SSD front. I saw you launched a new version of the Enterprise SSD that you had acquired from sTec. Can you just talk about the road map there now that you seem to be progressing with some of the products they have? Is that considered the next generation controller, for example? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Rich, just to clarify, the product that we recently announced is actually a Ultrastar product that is related to the -- our joint development arrangement with Intel. What we have done is unified our road map or rationalized the combined road map between sTec, Virident and HGST. We have a single road map going forward. You will continue to see new product introductions coming out from us on that front, again, as we move to the back half of the year, and we are getting -- we continue to be increasingly optimistic about the road map and the products that we'll be introducing in that space. One other thing to add to that, you saw that this past quarter, our revenue was lower in the SSD space versus prior quarters. If you recall, for the last 2 quarters, we had indicated that we were in a sole-source situation. That customer has now multi-sourced that product so we're seeing our revenue, if you want to call it, normalized, as a result of that. We will -- we expect to see revenue expansion on a quarter-on-quarter basis as we move through the back half of this year and obviously, into 2015 as well.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So this is the trough for the SSD side?","Stephen D. Milligan","That's right, Rich.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the drive side, you also announced the 6 terabyte that was non-Helium so presumably, that's shingle. But can you just talk about your view of areal density and if you think we can get consistently back above 20% over the next 12 to 18 months?","Stephen D. Milligan","Areal density advances will continue to be modest, whether it's in that 20% kind of a range. Until we get to some advanced technologies, and that's really an industry statement, we feel comfortable with where we're at as a company from a competitive technology perspective. And the 6 terabyte product that was recently introduced, 5-Platter, which is clearly leading areal density point, is oriented towards the NAS market. So it's not -- just to clarify, and it's not oriented towards the enterprise market, but more towards the NAS market.","Operator","Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the performance enterprise? What was behind that strength that you saw? And I do have a follow-up as well.","Stephen D. Milligan","Relative to performance enterprise, just 2 things really to comment on. One, we saw a bit of improved demand from a overall sort of industry perspective. I don't think that there's anything specific to call out that was driving that, just in general, a little bit more strength from an overall industry TAM perspective. More importantly, as it relates to our numbers, is that we saw particular strength as we continued to refresh and build out our product line in the performance enterprise space, and I think that customer acceptance of those products and the capabilities of those products is reflected in our -- in the numbers that we published today.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","Okay. And then I want to revisit lots of color on the PC OEM conversations, which is really great. But can you actually get into what is behind that uniformly positive discussion? Is it more than just temporal enterprise tailwind from the XT end of service?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, there's certainly 2 things, in particular, that we're seeing. One is, is that the commercial PC market on a relative basis continues to be stronger than consumer. Albeit, I mean let's be frank, PCs were still flat to slightly down. But we're seeing an improving demand profile in the commercial space, which undoubtedly have to do with a Windows refresh cycle there. The thing that, frankly from my perspective, was probably the most encouraging is that we're beginning to see, let's call it, initial signs of strength in the consumer space or maybe the beginnings of some strength. If you look at the latest data that was published, the rate of decline in the consumer PC space is declining. And now certainly, it's coming off of more favorable compares, but we are beginning to see some initial encouraging signs in terms of commercial PC demand. Now why that's the case? I'm not sure that we know for sure. Arguably, there may be -- there's a lot of PCs out there that haven't been upgraded for a while. And people, rather than, let's say, call it tablets fatigue or what have you, they're diverting dollars that may have previously gone to other devices to finally upgrading their PCs. And so maybe some encouraging news, and we're optimistic that it will continue certainly through 2014, and we're getting more encouraged it will carry into 2015 as well.","Operator","Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions for me. First of all, if we look at the revenue growth for the year, it was obviously down slightly. Your markets had been tough, but seems to be turning. I'm thinking back to 2 years ago when you had an Analyst Meeting and talked about sort of like a 4% type of growth for the company as a whole, top line. I was curious if we can revisit that and maybe talk about your comfort level around that as a secular trend if some of these markets do show some more modest recovery. And then I had a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure. I think that the major change that we've seen since -- jeez, when was that when we had the Analyst Day, a couple of years ago, is that we've seen -- we saw a more severe contraction in terms of the PC market. It's probably the principal thing that we saw. Maybe some other changes in terms of other markets, but I think the biggest driver of that was PCs. I mean, right now, if we were to call the TAM, we would say that we'd be looking at maybe flattish to slightly small single-digits increases. With -- given that we're moving to a richer mix underneath those numbers, maybe modest single-digit revenue increase. That is still with pretty, if you want to call it, conservative. I mean, we still have to continue to see how sustainable the PC market is from a longer-term perspective. And so -- but as we see more encouraging signs in the PC market, we may adjust that, but I think that's kind of where we're at right now.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","I appreciate that color. And then just, Steve, one follow-up on what you mentioned with the PCIe roadmap. Can you sort of qualitatively talk about how all these acquisitions are coming together and sort of time frame for maybe seeing something public that we could start to understand how far along you are?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. I mean I think it's certainly, this quarter, we'll have some things that we'll talk about, and some things we'll continue into the end of the year in terms of new product introductions. We'll get more visibility on that. And not only that, I think that we'll begin to see some more meaningful, I'll call it, revenue accretion from the acquisitions. And again, as Tim indicated in his prepared remarks, we are on course to have those acquisitions be accretive in the first part of 2015. So I would say that on balance, the acquisitions are tracking to our expectations.","Operator","Next is Rob Cihra with Evercore.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could just get a little bit more into sort of the pricing and competitive dynamics in the market. And if you look at the quarter, you guys gained some shares sequentially, and I realize there's some mix elements in there, including gaming, of course, that's probably transient. But I just want to -- if you see market share shifts, in some sense it seems positive, but then sort of the pessimistic side of you says, \"Oh God, if market share is missing around, that means that pricing is more competitive or that there's any kind of competitive posturing going on.\" I mean, do you see any of that working its way into the market, given that we really haven't -- we've had awfully good market for the past couple of years? Or am I being too cautious, and is this simply just a quarter-to-quarter movement based on mix and that sort of thing?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. Rob, I can certainly appreciate the concern. I think that if you look at what happened -- I mean, that is not what happened. There was not any particular pricing dynamics that drove those share shifts. We've talked about this before. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, share can move around 1 point or 2 depending upon the circumstances. Clearly, the areas that -- we went into the quarter anticipating that we would gain share because, we, for frankly a number of years, have had a particular strength with the gaming customers, and seasonally, we knew that, that was going to be particularly strong in calendar Q2. Then -- so that was no surprise to us and was expected. I think the thing that, if you want to call it, surprised us was notebook PCs were stronger than what we expected. Through both of our subsidiaries, we have a strong position in that market, and given our model, and I would say that at some level, advantaged margin structure, we were able to take advantage of that maybe a little bit easier than other guys, but it wasn't because of any particular pricing dynamics.","Operator","Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","I think I wanted to ask on the guidance here. Just to clarify, does it include a full 14th week of sales? Because I guess, if it does, implied seasonality is down a few points, at least, at the midpoint. And within that, if you could address the seasonal trends by your different buckets on a sequential basis, that would help.","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes, it does include the 14th week of sales. Now it's pretty hard to identify how much of it is a difference versus what would normally be a 13-week because, as you know, with the way that the dynamics of the quarters go, generally, there's a fairly strong 13th week and then the first week of the following quarter, it tends to be driven by outside factors, by customer behavior, et cetera. So consequently, it's hard for us to figure out exactly how much we've taken a shot at it, obviously. We're up 7% to 8%. It does include the anticipated uplift that we would get as well. Coming after the weaker June quarter, we would anticipate in normal circumstances -- even in a 13th-week situation, we'd expect some low single-digit increase from the June quarter through the September quarter and then some element of full week that we've loaded in for the beginning of the 1st week of the new quarter, which now becomes our 14th week. And as Steve has indicated, I don't -- we're moving up from somewhere around $138 million or so to around $145 million, but we -- in those numbers, we have anticipated the 14th.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's really helpful. And can you just briefly address on a pure organic basis how you see the individual segments trending on a unit basis into September if excluding the additional week?","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes, we expect that gaming will stay strong. We expect that notebook will continue to retain its strength. We expect retail, in particular, to be seasonally strong, and we're also expecting some level of comeback in capacity enterprise, and we're expecting performance enterprise to continue its strength as well.","Stephen D. Milligan","Just to make it real simple, basically, we're expecting reasonable growth, which means that we're seeing reasonable strength in all segments, except for gaming. Not that we're not seeing strength in gaming, but gaming from a TAM perspective will would be roughly flat. Everything else should be up a bit.","Operator","Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for me. One, I was wondering, Tim, if you could just touch on the cash conversion cycle. It sort of crept up pretty steadily over the last several years. And I'm curious, I mean, you have this target of 4 to 8 days. What does it take for you guys to get there? Is it the approval of MOFCOM? Or can you get there the way the structure is today?","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes. Well, our 4 to 8 days is really pre-acquisition model, which is more for a client business rather than enterprise business. And we've held off from revising it because of the fact that since we're operating 2 separate businesses, it's -- it could be a wasted effort until we managed to get over the challenges on efficiency that we have from MOFCOM. So it's something that we're watching, something that we're really paying attention to. I think we've got opportunity in inventory in particular, although we are funding inventory, funding finished goods in order to improve our cost and also in order to buy capital expenditure because we're trying to operate linearly so that we don't have to deal with spikes and have equipment and all the needless spikes. And we're also trying to be cognizant of the challenges in the supply chain. So we're also trying to have a friendlier approach towards the DPOs as well. But we've got a high mix from an enterprise viewpoint, and from a regional viewpoint, we've got a high mix of OEM customers, and that does put a little bit of a cramp on the DSOs.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And as a follow-on, I was wondering if you'd touch on the 6 terabyte Helium-based drive that you guys have for enterprise market. I believe Seagate has a comparable 6 terabyte drive not based on Helium. But are you seeing a better adoption of these high-capacity drives, especially entering the back half, given the fact that customers now have a dual-source option in that space?","Stephen D. Milligan","The first thing is that I would say is that the introduction of our 6 terabyte Helium-filled drive really 2 things: One, it has been well received in the marketplace; and two, it is meeting our expectations from a volume perspective. The second thing that I would say, which we've talked about before, is that the 6 terabyte product that we introduced was principally, I will call it, a technology demonstration. And what -- not that it's not a real product. I don't want to imply that, but we -- from a customer perspective, we want to say, \"Look, this is a platform that we are introducing that we want you to get comfortable with.\" We will continue to introduce follow-on products from a Helium-filled perspective that we believe will be very competitive in the marketplace, and we also believe will drive further increases from a volume perspective. So the 6 terabyte product was not an end-all to be-all so to speak.","Operator","Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Given the incremental units in revenue in the September quarter from the 14th week, does that create a flat to down sequential trend in December? Do you think the industry can still grow sequentially even though your comp-ing that 14th week? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. Katy, I think that's a very good question. I think it's a little bit too early to call, but if we were to look at it today, we would probably see a decrease going into calendar Q4. If nothing else, really 2 things. One, seasonality has shifted over time. Q4 is not as strong as it used to be. People are putting things on boats to save in terms of transportation cost and those kind of things. And also, the 14th -- going from a 14th week to a 13th week will impact our volumes. And so at this point, we would expect that we would be down going into calendar Q4. The question is, is how much, and that -- it's too early to call that.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then given the strong outlook for the September quarter, better visibility among PC OEMs, why not step up the share buyback, given you're running at higher cash levels versus your peer?","Timothy M. Leyden","Yes. I mean, it's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. We're currently pursuing the plan that we outlined in the -- September 2012 at the Investor Day. And we recently -- actually twice in the past year, we increased the dividend, but we're continuing to execute on the plan for 50% of free cash flow. And we've fallen -- sometimes, it gone a little ahead of us, sometimes, we've fallen behind. And this last quarter, we did actually above 62% or so of free cash flow. But it's something we evaluate on an ongoing basis. It was a pretty big change for us as a company. So consequently, it's something that we'll do on a measured basis, but it's not -- but it's something that's on the radar screen all the time.","Operator","Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","The first question is if you look at the last quarter, you had talked about some inventive addition like at some of the cloud customers, and then rearchitecting of systems and enterprise customers. You just -- you have talked about that you expect kind of a strength in that quarter-to-quarter, but could you maybe talk more qualitatively the demand trends you're seeing from your cloud customers?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes. I think from a cloud customer perspective, we -- it ties in the comment I made earlier. We are continuing to see the order flow and the sentiment of our customers improve somewhat gradually. Again, it's not a step-function kind of an increase, but we believe that we're going to continue to see an improving demand profile as we move through the back half of the year. And so some of the issues that we talked about last quarter on our call, those have been resolved and sorted out, and we're looking at a more favorable demand environment.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And the last one for me, the Xyratex acquisition is -- kind of grows. So could you maybe talk about if you are seeing any impact on the share in the enterprise market because of that acquisition by the Seagate or regarding the test equipment support from Teradyne or from Xyratex?","Stephen D. Milligan","There's been no impact related to that.","Well, thank you very much for joining us today and for your interest in Western Digital.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected given a week PC market. In that context I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning coupled with solid execution. Our enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SaaS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering. It is been qualified with several leading customers and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016. We saw strong demand for our high-capacity helium and 15K RPM 2.5 inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose filed solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for enterprise storage business remains healthy and we believe we are well position to address this growing market space. Regarding PC market demand we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said we are seeing early signs of market stabilization. Leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up towards the end of this calendar year. On more stable PC market demand environment coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the mean time we will continue to be discipline to the management of our business while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes.","I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential time table for them to complete their work. We have submitted a comprehensive report on the current market which we believe shows that the storage eco-system has evolved significantly in the last three years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We have also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our view on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hol separate in the near future.","Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook.","Olivier Leonetti","Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.2 billion. We shipped a total of 48.5 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8% and operating expenses totaled $560 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 7% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis net income of $356 million or $1.51 per share. In the June quarter we generated $488 million in cash from operation and our free cash flow totaled $332 million. Our CapEx totaled $156 million of 5% of revenue we repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed year end with total cash and cash equivalent of $5 billion of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S.","I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, excluding the amortization of intangibles we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat with our June quarter.","Operating expenses of approximately $575 million and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60.","Operator we are now ready attend the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn Huberty","Yes, thanks. I believe coming into the June quarter, you had expected a fixed cost absorption hit on gross margins. It doesn't look like inventory on the balance sheet came down in June. So just curious if you could walk through the gross margin drivers in September, and particularly, given the high inventory, why don't we see a hit on gross margin as you go into the next quarter?","Olivier Leonetti","So we had to manage in the June quarter various variables. First of all to your point fixed cost absorption was an issue because of the lower TAM and we were able to mitigate -- more than mitigate this negative effect through two factors. First of all mix up improvement and also management of our cost based.","Kathryn Huberty","Yes just a quick follow up on OpEx, which was down $30 million again in the June quarter. Where are those cost savings coming from, in light of the restrictions around MOFCOM, and do you still see the same net savings, to the extent that you get that MOFCOM approval, over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.","Olivier Leonetti","So two parts in your question, on part number one, most of the saving in the quarter is due to lower executive compensation or lower executive compensation in total due to obviously the performance of the company. These are the MOFCOM, the synergies we have announced are still intact, as a reminder we have indicated that synergy in OpEx would be in the range of 400 million a year and that COGS synergies would be material and on top of that number.","Operator","And the next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks. One question, one follow-up, as well. Going back to Katy's question, when you look at the gross margin this quarter, which was quite impressive, considering a 120 down to a 111 million unit number for the industry, what is the impact to gross margin that you've seen, given the inability or given the deleverage from a fixed cost absorption perspective? If it weren't for the lower TAM, I'm asking what kind of gross margin could you have attained in this last quarter.","Olivier Leonetti","So the impact of lack of absorption is material right. We are not going to give any details of how much it was. But indeed it would have been a material increase in the margin rate.","Steve Milligan","The other thing Aaron to keep in mind which is that, obviously the part of the business that was weaker which is PC related, so our client business carries a lower margin. Yes there is absorption impact in terms of having less units. But the effect of having a lower amount of lower margin business naturally provides -- if you want to call it, accretion from a gross margin perspective. Because our software business whether it be from revenue or a unit or for that matter from an earnings perspective was entirely driven by a slower PC market.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And as a follow-up, when we look into the back half of the year, I think last quarter we talked about a 40-60 split in terms of enterprise demand, particularly from the hyperscale and cloud guys. What's your current outlook relative to that for the second half on the enterprise side, and is that not a positive factor to consider from a mix perspective on gross margin going forward?","Steve Milligan","So the 40-60 split that I believe was talked about last quarter I think was on the CA call that is consistently what it's run over the last several years. We would expect generally speaking for that pattern to hold plus or minus few percentage points for this calendar as well. And then I\u2019ll ask Olivier to comment on the puts and takes in terms of gross margin for our September quarter.","Olivier Leonetti","So the statement about 40-60 is mainly exabyte statement. So relative to our guidance we are guiding to roughly flat, meaning it could be slightly up or slightly down. Obviously, we have many puts and takes which could unfold during the quarter. Enterprise could be stronger, PC demand could be stronger, that could be negative to the margin rate and we think that\u2019s roughly flat is as good as we can guide at the stage.","Operator","And the next question is from Joseph Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joseph Wittine","I understand the PC market is rough, but your shipments are eroding faster than the industry. You're down about 30% year-over-year. PC units down about low double digits. So curious why you're decelerating so much faster. What chunk of it is inventories, is been taken down, therefore you get some sort of snapback, versus how much is just the ongoing secular decline in hard drive attach rates within PCs? Any color would be helpful.","Steve Milligan","Yes so two comments on that and you\u2019ve hit on them. We don\u2019t have entire visibility to this all by the way. But we believe that there has been a meaningful inventory draw down both on -- throughout the supply chain from a PC perspective. So and we certainly from our own company perspective have been very careful to not over drive the market in terms of shipping too much inventory into our customers. And so we've seen a sharper decline in our client business than what we've seen from a broader PC perspective because of what we believe to be a meaningful thinning of the overall inventory supply, that\u2019s one factor.","To what extent that\u2019s happen, that\u2019s difficult to determine. But clearly our customers do not want to have or do not want to run the risk of having, \u201cobsolete inventory\u201d in front of the Intel and the Microsoft transition. So that\u2019s clearly caused them to draw their inventory levels down. The second thing is that we naturally are going to decline faster than the broader PC market because of the increasing attach rate of solid state devices replacing hard drives, which is consistent of by the way with our expectations. So that helps explain at least some of the disconnect on our numbers versus the broader PC industry.","Joseph Wittine","That's helpful, Stephen. And I guess a follow-on would be what does guidance assume as far as PC inventories in the third quarter and what\u2019s the TAM baked in that as well?","Steve Milligan","If you look at -- let me give you some data points to contemplate. Obviously we have not seen Seagate\u2019s -- Toshiba's numbers published yet, so we don't know where they ended up. But we would expect that the TAM for last quarter to be somewhere between on 110 and 112 depending upon where Toshiba lands. The TAM that we are using for purposes of our guidance or assuming for purposes of guidance would approximate 115 million. The increase from -- let\u2019s just use 110 because it\u2019s round number, from 110 to 115, that increase is driven by two factors. Seasonal increase in gaming, seasonal increase in branded, that would imply that other segments of the market are flat from a unit perspective.","And when you get into the PC market we would expect that to be roughly flat at least as it relates to hard drive shipments into the market from an Enterprise perspective, we believe that units will be roughly flat. Keep in mind one of the comments that we made is that we believe that there will be meaningful increase in terms of exabyte shipments that as we are mixing up the higher capacities and shipping six terabytes and eight terabyte, obviously the unit consumption gets affected by that such that the unit increase is more muted.","Operator","And the next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. Your line is open.","Rich Kugele","Just my two questions will be, first and foremost on helium. Can you give us a sense on how much of your enterprise business today is based on helium and competitively when you do come up against another offering that is more traditional based. Presumably you're coming in at a premium because of the --. So just competitively when you go up against someone else with more traditional drive and air based drive with helium. Can you just talked about your win rates there? Just understand that dynamic as we move to higher and higher capacities that are exclusively helium based.","Steve Milligan","Sure the first thing Rich is that I'm not going to provide any additional color on the volume of our capacity enterprise drives that\u2019s helium versus traditional in-air drives at this point. But obviously as we have indicated overtime, we'll be transitioning particularly when we move to the 10 terrabyte and things like that, the 6 terra byte is intended to be our last in-air product. So as customers mix up, larger and larger percentage of our business is going to be helium based. Relative to head-to-head competition, a couple of things to keep in mind. First thing is that we -- the customers that we\u2019re dealing with have pretty sophisticated total cost of ownership algorithms that allow them to look at more than just simply the price of the hard drive.","And we recognize the fact that clearly the price of hard drive is one element. But when we factor in from a total cost of ownership perspective and we're going head-to-head at a similar capacity point we actually have pretty good win rates. And in some cases, obviously, we\u2019ve transitioned to the 8 terrabyte right now, we got a distinct advantage from that capacity perspective which sets us apart in terms of winning business.","Rich Kugele","And then in terms of the non-PC percentage of revenue. Do you have a sense for that might be exiting fiscal '16?","Steve Milligan","That\u2019s a good question Rich. And I dare to speculate, to tell you the truth because the lots of it will depend upon what happens with the PC business. So I don\u2019t think I want to try to forecast a number at this point. Because I would happily have it remain the same because that would mean that the PC business was actually looking a little bit better. But if we don\u2019t see the PC market pick-up than obviously our non-PC business is going to continue to increases as a percentage of the total. So that\u2019s a long non-answer to your question.","Operator","And the next question is from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","One for each Steve and Olivier, Steve just kind of following up on the last question just think out, kind of past this year into and even through '16. What is a prudent way for us to think about how you guys -- do you normalize exabyte growth? I know it might be -- there is a lot of moving part in the current environment. But every year your latest thought-process there would be helpful. Then I have a follow up, thanks.","Olivier Leonetti","So if you look at exabyte today, we see it to be easy, high single digit with some nuances as you go bilateral [ph] business, capacity enterprise was a big oversees focus. We would expect it to grow in the 50% range which is what we've observed on average for the last four quarters. Strong performance on that standpoint.","Ananda Baruah","And then Olivier for you just on the OpEx level to just sort of expect going forward. I believe last quarter before PC [indiscernible] that they did, that you are looking sort of at a like 590 plus or minus level depending on were in the year you are. You pulled that kind of cost this quarter. Although it sounds like maybe this was sort of a little on the prudent side. So would love to get your take on how we should think about OpEx level going forward.","Olivier Leonetti","So we guided to a lower number $575 million for the next quarter, it's probably a number we would stick to for the coming four quarter basic on the adjustment we have to do to our cost based on the time level.","Operator","The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","I just wanted to ask your view and what you're hearing from your cloud enterprise customers at this point given the fact that a number of the big cloud providers Twitter, Amazon Facebook are all cutting their CapEx plan. You guys sound on the call to be very bullish on capacity growth. I just wanted to get your sense of what those company\u2019s plans are given their cutting their CapEx thanks.","Steve Milligan","Yes so let me talk about kind of them in general terms. The first thing is, which may sound very much like an obvious statement. We have a number of customers and relative to anyone particular period we may see relative strength or relative weakness in particular accounts and by the way, obviously part of our job from the management perspective is to manage whatever either call it segment or customer volatility from a demand perspective that we might happen to see. And so there is always going to be noise in that regard that we have to deal with.","In general as an overall statement, we feel very good about our positioning from a product perspective from a technology perspective, from a customer perspective positioning standpoint and the numbers that we're looking at are relatively consistent. With our previous expectations and we continue to expect that in the back half of the year we're going to see pretty healthy pick up from an overall exabyte perspective and we'll see how that translate from a unit perspective as we ship higher capacity drives. But it should also drive a pretty healthy first half to back half revenue increase in terms of its contribution to our overall business.","Sherri Scribner","And just thinking about that exabyte growth accelerating in back half of the year. What is driving is that? Is that further builds by some of your customers is that something that you see sort of seasonally? I\u2019m just trying to understand that a bit better. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","Let me give you a little bit of context. So if you look over the last roughly three years particularly in that space about 40% of exabyte shipments are in the first half of the year about 60% and in the second half of the year. We're expecting roughly speaking that kind of a split to continue and I would suggest that\u2019s just due to normal seasonality in terms of the nature of that business. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there is an acceleration per say in that segment from a year-on-year perspective.","Operator","Next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Headcount is down 8% year-on-year. Can you talk a little bit about where those adjustments were made, how much was manufacturing related versus maybe G&A that can persist into the back half? And I have a follow up.","Steve Milligan","The majority of that is our manufacturing workers in Asia. All of it.","Wamsi Mohan","And on the MOFCOM side you sound more optimistic today versus 90 days ago, first, am I correct in assuming that? Clearly you\u2019ve been meeting them throughout this process. So what's giving you an increase confident of a speedy resolution? And if you don\u2019t have a resolution six months will you be like negatively surprise?","Steve Milligan","The comments that I made in my prepared remarks, frankly speaking, kind of stands on its own in terms of the commentary. And the reasons why we believe that or that we\u2019re hopeful for a decision in the near term. So I'd refer you back to my script for a detail in terms of that. Your question with regards to would I'd be surprise if we didn\u2019t have a decision before the end of the year is obviously a tricky question. I don\u2019t know if I would say surprise, but obviously I would be surely disappointed if we didn\u2019t have a decision by them.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your SSD business. It has some fantastic growth over the past year. What are the key drivers and how do you think your growth is comparing to the marketplace at this point?","Steve Milligan","Sure couple of comments on that, the first thing is that from an overall growth perspective we do believe that we are gaining market share in that market. And so we are exceeding industry growth averages. The lion\u2019s share -- this is consistent with the past, the lion\u2019s share of revenue continues to be related to our SaaS based SSD product. The one really encouraging thing from my perspective is that we're beginning to see a much more meaningful contribution from our PCIe NVM product. It's still relatively small compare to the 244 but we saw a nice pick up from counter in Q1 into counter Q2, we\u2019re gaining increasing momentum and we expect, as I indicated in my prepared remarks that the revenue contribution from those products will continue to increase as we move through fiscal 2016.","Steven Fox","And just as a quick follow up given where units are right now and some of the average capacities you\u2019ve talked about. What are the chances that you would consider writing down some capacity at certain parts of the production process in the near term?","Steve Milligan","So we are constantly evaluating and constantly looking that. And you can see that we have taken -- as the market has decline -- let's be clear, the market has decline significantly over the last two or three years. And we have consistently evaluated our investments and our capital levels as we've seen the market come to new and different level. We are going to continue to do that and continue to take actions to make sure we right-size not only our manufacturing capabilities, but also our investments from OpEx perspective to make sure that we do our best to provide appropriate financial performance for our shareholders.","Operator","And the next question is from Christian Schwab, Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.","Christian Schwab","I have a follow up similar to that line of thinking. Our non-PC revenue has been your revenue, I should say is been fairly consistent and about 2 billion to 2.2 billion a quarter for the last few years. When we look at your gross profit dollar generated, I would assume that it\u2019s higher than then the non-PC revenue. Meaning that 70% plus of your gross profit dollars are generated a non-PC product. Is that fair?","Steve Milligan","Without confirming the exact the number that you quoted. The non-PC areas of our business carry a higher gross profit than our traditional client business and so if 65% of our revenue contribution is non-PC, then obviously the profit contribution in that is greater.","Christian Schwab","Right, so I guess where I\u2019m going with that is if we get MOFCOM approval and we started to right down more capacity in notebooks and PCs. We're going to print cash for as long as that non-PC revenue doesn\u2019t dissipate, right?","Steve Milligan","Yes, we would believe that there will be significant synergies as a result of the lifting of the hold separate, which will not only benefit our company, our shareholders. But we'll also be able to benefit consumers in the form of more competitive pricing.","Christian Schwab","And if you look at the 76,000 people we got left working for us. Can you remind us the break out of those employees roughly?","Olivier Leonetti","There is nothing to remind you off, we've not broken that out.","Christian Schwab","You haven\u2019t broken that out?","Steve Milligan","No.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","Olivier, can you help with -- what was the charge for the -- there is a 104 million charges this quarter that was reversed out from GAAP to non-GAAP. What was that for?","Olivier Leonetti","The modernity of that, all of it was due to us resizing our business into [indiscernible] the current time level. So all of it is the adjustment of our supply chain, end-to-end to, face the new reality.","Keith Bachman","So was it a permanent reduction the fixed cost base, just trying to understand was it a onetime -- truly a onetime event or does that carry forward and reduce your fixed cost?","Olivier Leonetti","That will be one adjustment we have done among others in the past and this one will carry its impact going forward indeed.","Keith Bachman","Steve one for you then, in terms of MOFCOM is it a zero sum game and what I mean by that is, this has been puts and takes here. It feels like it ebbs and flows over the last year and change. What happens if the Chinese Government just doesn\u2019t say anything and this goes on for perpetuity? And what I mean by that is this does Western Digital have plans -- contingency plans whereby they could reduce cost even without the hold separate that would at least [Audio Gap] or do you need to get MOFCOM to really take your cost structure meaningfully lower from this juncture?","Steve Milligan","We're going to continue to evaluate all of our option. But I think it's very dangerous, Keith, for me to speculate as to what we would do if we have no response from MOFCOM.","Keith Bachman","Okay fair enough. Nice job on the gross margin guys.","Operator","The next question is from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Monika Garg","Could you maybe talk about what was like-for-like pricing in the quarter and what do you expect in the September quarter as well?","Olivier Leonetti","Monika nothing half of beyond entry [ph]. The market remains competitive and we wouldn\u2019t characterize this quarter, the one we closed very differently from the prior one. And we would expect that to prevail in the September quarter.","Monika Garg","As a follow your enterprise revenue has grown significantly this year. Is it fair to think in fiscal 2016 that could be greater than $1 billion business?","Steve Milligan","I don\u2019t know if we provided a specific estimate in terms of what our revenue level will be. But we continue to expect that we're going to see nice growth in our overall enterprise business.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Shope, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bill Shope","Could you give us some color on how we should think about margin transfer enterprise SSD business relative to the enterprise HDD business? I know you don\u2019t give the absolute levels, but if you could just give us some color on how we should think about the trends relative, particularly now that they\u2019re becoming much more significant part of the overall business.","Steve Milligan","What we said in the past and it continues to be true is that, the gross margin generally speaking for our SSD business is below the corporate average, I mean it\u2019s still very good margin, but below the corporate average. But it is clearly above the corporate average from a return on investment capital. Because we don\u2019t have the same form of, call it, vertical integration in investments.","Bill Shope","And then I guess looking at your capital allocation obviously you continue give back cash to shareholders each quarter. But do you see any incremental change to the capital allocation plans or near term activity given the recent fell off in the stock price and some of the concerns that have pressured the stock relative to the market recently?","Olivier Leonetti","So we look at capital allocation regularly. But we still believe that even at this point in time giving back 50% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buyback is a balance approach. To reward our shareholders today but also to keep rewarding our shareholders tomorrow, to keep investing in the business and we mentioned some attractive investments, helium, enterprise SSD and active cloud being a few examples.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Yoo with Citi Group. Your line is open.","Joe Yoo","Steve, I wanted to ask more general question about mission critical performance wise if I could. So I know you don\u2019t break out performance versus near-line. But if you look at industry data, mission critical has been fairly flat and actually it's been growing in the last couple of quarters. And you\u2019re in sort of an interesting position where you can -- you sell both the SaaS drives and SaaS SSDs and which are largely viewed as substitute. So can you help us understand why fast drives remains so resilient despite such strong adoption from SSD?","Steve Milligan","Are you telling relative to us or in general?","Joe Yoo","Either, I mean but may be you can start with WD.","Steve Milligan","Well if relative to us, if you remember we had a hole in our portfolio where we did not have a competitive 2.5 inch small form factor SaaS hard drive. We now have a competitive product and so in that space, which albeit a relatively small part of the performance enterprise market we've been able to pick up some share in that space just by having a competitive product. So that\u2019s help strengthen our relative performance, from a performance enterprise standpoint. From a standpoint of SaaS versus -- not SaaS, enterprise SSD versus a small form factor hard drive, right now we're not seeing much cannibalization per say, we do expect that there will be cannibalization overtime. And it tends to be work load driven in terms of the way the systems are configured. So there hasn\u2019t been cannibalization so far, but we do expect that that will happen in the future and that there will be some cross-over between 2.5 inch 15k drives and SSDs in the future.","Joe Yoo","And what is the critical factor in actually making that happens? Is it pricing, as in the cost of NAND?","Steve Milligan","Pricing and also work load driven, in terms of how the systems are configured.","Steve Milligan","Thank again for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today's conference.

Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2014. [Operator instructions.] Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair","Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and storage ecosystem, stabilization of demand in our business, demand trends in the enterprise space, our product offerings and our customers\u2019 responses to our product offerings, and our financial performance, including our financial results and expectations for the June quarter. ","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 31, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.","In addition, references will be made during the call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. ","The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident; asset impairment and other charges; charges related to litigation; and expense due to the writeoff of debt issuance costs.","Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor's section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.","I\u2019d now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital Steve Milligan.","Steve Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter.","We achieved solid financial results for the March quarter, with revenue in line with our expectations and gross margin and earnings per share exceeding our guidance. Cash generation remained strong. Our steady financial performance continues to demonstrate an ability to manage the business and deliver ongoing value to our customers and shareholders.","Both of our subsidiaries executed well in the March quarter, as we continue to participate in the ongoing growth of data with an intense focus on helping our customers succeed in a rapidly changing environment.","Our results reflect sustained strength in gaming, anticipated seasonality in client and branded products, and some softness in the enterprise space. The industry TAM was slightly higher than anticipated, driven by the strength in gaming.","We continue to see demand stabilizing in the commercial side of our client business as part of a PC refresh cycle, and we remain positive about the long term demand trends in the enterprise space. The continued strength in gaming is due to consumers\u2019 healthy demand for the newest game console designs, all of which have integrated hard drives. Overall, we believe industry supply and demand remain in balance. ","We continue to believe very excited about our unique position in the overall storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on the dramatic changes that are underway. Customers are responding positively to a number of new products and technologies we are bringing to market to help them to be successful.","Specifically, our enterprise class SSD business had another strong quarter. We will continue to expand our full range of enterprise SSD products, including SAS, PCIe, and SATA, in a range of form factors and capacity points, as well as grow our software and solution offerings.","Several strategic OEM customers have qualified our 6 TB helium filled drive, and we are shipping to them in volume. The product is generally available on a global basis, resulting in broad adoption in all geographies. It is important to note that our innovative helium technology platform is extendable to higher capacities and additional applications. ","We recently began shipping a new family of highest-performance, high capacity 2.5 inch 15K hard drives. Our customers continue to use 15K hard drives with SSDs in tiered pools of storage, and this new product addresses the industry\u2019s shift away from the 3.5 inch form factor to smaller 2.5 inch drives to help manage space requirements.","Customers have responded very positively to our Power of Choice lineup of hard drives, including the WD Red drives that ship primarily to value-added resellers who are configuring mass systems for small and medium businesses. Likewise, the new WD Purple series addresses security surveillance mass systems for the home and small businesses.","Both of these are high-growth segments where storage is a value-added means to an end for the customer, which makes them attractive opportunities for us. We continue to see opportunities with our My Cloud network attached storage solutions in the home and small office segment. Our My Cloud solution provides the opportunity to connect with billions of devices that create, store, and display massive amounts of data.","All of these products reflect our highly focused strategy of helping our customers succeed through collaboration and innovation and are contributing to the favorable mix shift underway in our business to higher growth and higher value-added segments of the market.","Before turning it over to Tim, I wanted to address the topic of our discussions with China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. Consistent with our prior commentary, we had the opportunity to submit a request in March for MofCom to lift the hold separate restrictions on our business. We have done so and we continue to work with MofCom as they review our submission.","In the meantime, we continue to operate our HGST and WD subsidiaries separately and we will keep you informed of any material developments. ","Tim?","Timothy Leyden","Thank you, Steve. Our March quarter performance reflected healthy unit demand and solid execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 137 million units during the March quarter, which was higher than the TAM implied in the guidance we provided in January.","In our business, we saw continued strength in gaming, anticipated seasonal declines in client and branded products, and some softness in enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our 4 to 6 week range.","Our revenue for the March quarter was $3.7 billion, including $134 million from enterprise SSDs. Our enterprise SSD revenue was slightly better than we had expected, and some of the single source strengths we saw in the December quarter carried into the March quarter.","We continue to expect that our SSD enterprise business will outpace the market\u2019s revenue growth rate over the long term. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 60.4 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter over quarter decline in overall ASP was primarily driven by business mix. ","Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Excluding $39 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, as well as $16 million of restructuring charges, our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 60 basis points, primarily due to operational efficiencies and better utilization.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $628 million for the March quarter. SG&A included the following items: $11 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, and $4 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $8 million of restructuring charges. We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the March quarter relating to the Seagate arbitration matter. ","Tax expense for the March quarter was $31 million or, or 8% of pretax income. Net interest expense for the March quarter was $13 million, and included $4 million of debt issuance costs that were expensed with the payoff of the prior credit facility.","Our net income for the March quarter totaled $375 million or $1.55 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $470 million or $1.94 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $697 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $536 million. Our capex for the March quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.8 million shares for $244 million during the March quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share.","We entered Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $5 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion was in the U.S.","I\u2019ll now provide our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down and in a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion; gross margin approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending around $600 million, also excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8%; a share count of approximately 242 million.","Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.65 and $1.75, for the June quarter, which includes the dilution impact of approximately $0.10 of the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit, and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. ","Overall, we continue to execute well, and we are well-positioned to succeed in the evolving storage market. In closing, I want to point out to investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 will consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks, and the second, third, and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each. ","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. ","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","First question would be on the enterprise relative weakness. Maybe you can help us understand how the quarter progressed, where maybe in particular you saw the weakness, be it between the traditional enterprise guys, relative to the cloud vendors, and then how we should anticipate that business looking into the current quarter. ","Stephen Milligan","The primary area where we saw a bit of weakness in terms of enterprise demand was in capacity enterprise. Not so much traditional performance enterprise in terms of our business. That more or less tracked to our expectations. I think just to kind of put a little bit of context on this, one of the things to keep in mind as a general statement is that one, the volumes for capacity enterprise on a relative basis are not that large in terms of relative to the total TAM. ","The other thing is that the number of customers, it tends to be dominated by a relatively few number of customers. So any changes in purchasing behavior on the part of some of those larger customers can have a relatively significant impact on the overall numbers. So that\u2019s just a little bit of context.","With that being said, basically what we saw was increased efficiency from the standpoint of some of our significant hyperscale buyers. And efficiency is coming in the form of really a few things. One, supply chain efficiencies and efficiencies in the way that they deploy capacity from their standpoint through their deployments, and also, in terms of improved utilization, in terms of the overall storage capacity. ","So they\u2019re basically working off inventory that they already had in place, because of, if you want to call it, inefficiencies in their deployments. We see that persisting through our current quarter that we\u2019re in, our fiscal Q4, and we expect that demand will pick up in the second half of the year, more in line with what we\u2019ve been seeing in the past. And so it\u2019s a short term dynamic in terms of the first and the second calendar quarter of this year, and we don\u2019t expect to persist longer term.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel ","And as a follow up real quickly, I know you\u2019re not giving any updated thoughts around MofCom, but as we look at your business model and look at the utilization rates of your manufacturing, can you help us understand where you stand utilization wise, be it internal versus external on heads and media, and maybe how much opportunity exists to driving more efficiency or utilization out of those key assets?","Stephen Milligan ","I\u2019ll take a stab at that and then Tim can add to that as appropriate. First off, we\u2019re very comfortable right now in terms of where we\u2019re at with our internal versus external component purchases, really, on both subs. And frankly, they\u2019re at relatively consistent levels, coincidentally, not through any inappropriate coordination. They just happened to be at very similar levels in terms of the percentage of internal versus external components for both heads and media.","And generally speaking, that\u2019s been fairly consistent over the last few quarters, so we haven\u2019t seen any material change in that. From an overall utilization perspective and expected synergies that we might happen to realize if we are able to combine, we have not provided a specific number on that in terms of cost synergies. We have provided an indication of what we thought it would be on the opex side, but needless to say, it will be meaningful in terms of the reduction in terms of cost that we\u2019ll see on our cost of goods sold if we\u2019re able to combine the two entities.","And so clearly we think that will be a benefit, not only to our shareholders, but in particular to our customers, and will allow us to continue to fund the required innovations that we need to deal with the changing storage ecosystem that we\u2019re dealing with.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. ","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Just geographically, Asia was up, EMEA was down. Can you just put any color around that? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up.","Timothy Leyden","It was at the noise level, really. There was some movement in there, but it was relatively insignificant. So there wasn\u2019t anything really that was significant that would cause us to call it out separately.","Stephen Milligan ","One thing that I would call out is that obviously we saw strength in the gaming side of our business. That is all attributable to Asia. Because it\u2019s shipped into location, as opposed to where those ultimate systems get deployed. And so that might have something to do with that increase in Asia.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company ","And as a follow up, would you have a similar level of optimism for the second half of the calendar year as your primary competitor, both the PC client side as well as the hyperscale guys, coming back in ordering? I think you commented a little bit about that, but any other color you might have?","Stephen Milligan ","In terms of the second half of the year, we are optimistic about the enterprise side of the business, and so in that regard, I would say that we would concur with what our largest competitor has said. ","On the PC side, and Rich, you know us well, we probably tend to be a little bit more cautious and a little bit more conservative. We have definitely seen a stabilization in the PC market. Now, it still is declining on a year on year basis. Certainly a lot of that has to do with commercial refresh. The question there is that we don\u2019t know how long the sustainability of that commercial refresh. ","We believe that we\u2019ll continue to see some of that activity through the June quarter. The question is, does it persist through the back half of the year. Consumer generally speaking, as far as we can tell, continues to be relatively weak, so we\u2019re not really seeing any particular strength there. ","So I would characterize that we\u2019re probably cautiously optimistic regarding PC demand trends, but I think the stabilization is meaningful in the sense that there\u2019s less volatility. And that decreased volatility just makes it a little bit easier for us to manage and plan around that as opposed to chasing the ball around on the pitch trying to figure out which way it\u2019s going to go next.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company ","And just lastly, on ASPs, given the gaming mix, which is presumably a much lower ASP, that going down here in this June quarter, would you expect ASPs to be more firm this quarter, maybe even increase? What should we be expecting here for June?","Timothy Leyden ","They\u2019ll be flattish.","Stephen Milligan ","Yeah, we\u2019re going to continue to see pretty strong gaming volumes here in the current quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. ","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Just another follow up on the PC side. So it looks like both notebooks and desktop units underperformed relative to Seagate this quarter. The results are still in line with your normal 10% decline in calendar Q1, so was there anything abnormal in those segments that you noticed regarding pricing or share shift?","Stephen Milligan ","I wouldn\u2019t call anything out specifically from our standpoint. The client business from our perspective - and this is kind of at the margins, so it\u2019s not a significant thing - was a little bit stronger than what we expected. Gaming was certainly stronger than what we expected, and then the enterprise side, which I talked about earlier in terms of capacity enterprise, was a bit weaker. ","But the stronger PC business that we saw, it was not that significant within the whole grand scheme of things. And competitive behavior was within the norm, I guess you might say. We didn\u2019t see any unusual competitive behavior that would be particularly alarming to us.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray ","And then if you look at it from a region perspective, were there any large differences between your mature markets and your emerging markets?","Timothy Leyden ","I think the consumer business is a bit more impacted by the macroeconomic issues, and as you know, the emerging markets have been challenged really because of the foreign exchange. And so that continues, and we\u2019re seeing that the more mature markets are the stronger ones, and the emerging markets are the weaker ones. And of course the dislocation in Russia didn\u2019t help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. ","Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners","On the enterprise SSD side, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re still looking to be accretive from the sTec and Virident acquisitions early calendar 2015. I guess can you just help map out at all - maybe not specifically map out, although it would be awesome - where that\u2019s revenue driven versus cost cutting driven or cost savings driven? Is it all revenue driven, or is it just hopefully like a smooth ramp from here? Or are there kind of milestones that we can be looking for more specifically?","Timothy Leyden ","I think it\u2019s a continuing plan. We\u2019re putting together the multiple roadmaps for sTec, Virident, VeloBit, and the JDA. And as we put those together, we will have some efficiencies that will come from cost. We\u2019ll obviously be building up our revenue. ","So from where we are right now going towards the end of the year, by the time that we\u2019re exiting December, we will be pretty much at breakeven, or maybe a little bit accretive. And then we\u2019ll be fully accretive in the first quarter. And it will taper between now and then going from the $0.10 to where we are right now, towards that breakeven point in the December quarter, as we exit December. ","Stephen Milligan ","Just to add to that, the primary driver is revenue and ramping the new businesses. And the new business being those products that relate to the sTec and Virident acquisition. There are some synergies or rationalization from an opex perspective, but the primary driver will be continuing to ramp from a product perspective, from a revenue perspective, from a customer perspective, those new businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ","You were pretty clear on the drivers of the enterprise weakness, particularly within the hyperscale customer base. But could you give us some color on the demand trends you\u2019re seeing within capacity enterprise for traditional server and array OEMs? And how are you thinking about that as we progress through the calendar year?","Stephen Milligan ","I don\u2019t know if I would really call anything out, frankly, in terms of that. I mean, it\u2019s a little bit of a challenging question in the sense that we have a number of customers that increasingly are coming more and more direct to the [drive] guys, which is obviously impacting some of the traditional customer base. ","And so I don\u2019t think we saw anything in particular that stands out with our traditional customer base in the capacity enterprise market that\u2019s worthy of calling out, other than just ongoing challenges of how to remain relevant with some of the changing purchasing behaviors on behalf of some of our customers. ","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ","And then you had mentioned that you would extend your helium platform to other product lines over time. Can you remind us of how we should think about what this does to your cost structure relative to the competition now and particularly over time as the technology matures?","Stephen Milligan ","You mean our cost structure? Or our customer\u2019s cost structure?","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ","Your cost structure.  ","Stephen Milligan ","Well, the primary impact to our cost structure, which has nothing to do per se with helium, the fact that it\u2019s helium sealed, is that as we are shipping higher and higher capacity drives, whether they be 6 or 8 or 10 or whatever it happens to be as the product extends itself over a period of time, is the test times for these products are significant. And so we\u2019re having to add, or will have to add, as volumes ramp, meaningful amounts of test capacity. But that is not unique per se to the helium platform. It just has to do with the amount of data these things are storing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monica Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ","The first question is on the enterprise SSD side. Could you maybe talk about do you think in the next quarter you\u2019ll see enterprise demand to be flattish or decline before you see it pick up, as you talked about, in the back half of the year?","Timothy Leyden ","Each of the different segments, other than gaming, is likely to be down as you look quarter on quarter.","Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ","And the other question I have is on the enterprise SSD. If I look at your June 2013 enterprise revenues, they were about $104 million. And if I add sTec, which was only at about $25 million a quarter, and then you add Virident, VeloBit, and kind of one-time benefit, it seems that revenue is still flattish. Maybe could you talk about kind of when do you expect the pickup in that segment?","Stephen Milligan ","I think you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that relative to the sTec side, the momentum there was not exactly positive. So I think you\u2019ve got to consider that really we bought a, I hate to call it this, but a little bit of a distressed asset.","Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ","And just a last one on the Xyratex, you were talking recently about the test times increasing on the enterprise side. So maybe can you talk about with Seagate buying Xyratex, does that impact your test strategy somewhat? And kind of how do you see the relationship with the test manufacturers?","Stephen Milligan ","We are generally comfortable with where we\u2019re at in terms of our relationship with our test equipment suppliers, including with Xyratex\/Seagate. There are contractual provisions that were put in place prior to the closing of that transaction that we believe sufficiently protect us, and will provide for a constructive relationship going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. ","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley","How were you able to keep gross margins flat in the March quarter given lower volume, lower ASP, and the mix shift away from enterprise to gaming? Was there anything one-time or are whatever positive benefits you saw continuing into the next few quarters?","Stephen Milligan ","You know, I want to remain appropriately humble in terms of answering this question, but the reality is that we have a really good team, particularly from a manufacturing perspective, from a cost perspective, on both sides, being WD and HGST, and they are constantly working on eking out every dollar of savings that we can. And so it\u2019s just a matter of sort of scratching and crawling every day, to make sure that we\u2019re realizing appropriate efficiencies and it shows up in our numbers.","That being said, overall, even though the volumes came in the form of, let\u2019s say, gaming primarily, in terms of upside, which didn\u2019t necessarily translate to higher ASPs and that sort of thing, we did get some additional efficiencies from higher volumes that provided some of that uplift as well. But frankly, I have to take my hat off to our operations team in terms of their ability to grind out cost savings all the time.","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley ","So that should continue?","Stephen Milligan ","I certainly hope so.","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley ","And then just lastly, do you need the $2.5 billion of net cash? And what\u2019s holding you back from stepping up on the buyback, given fairly constructive comments about second half of the calendar year?","Timothy Leyden ","We continue to pursue the plan that we outlined in September of 2012, at our analyst day, which is 50% of free cash flow. But obviously as we go forward, we\u2019re in the business of making sure that we maximize the value for the shareholders. So consequently, we are always looking to see what\u2019s best mix, and what\u2019s the best balance between investing in the business for future gain and also making sure that we meet our obligations that we have outlined to shareholders.","So it\u2019s an ongoing process that we\u2019re looking at, and we continue to look at it. But we\u2019re very pleased with the generation of the cash flow and obviously we keep looking at it.","Stephen Milligan ","I think another comment to make, and not to in any way message that we have anything planned, but one of the things that we think is important is that we continue to keep our powder dry in terms of looking at additional opportunities, whether that be M&A or otherwise. ","There are a lot of dramatic changes going on in the storage world, in the data world. We believe we\u2019ve got our eyes and ears to the ground in terms of trying to understand what\u2019s happening, where we\u2019 can add value from a customer perspective, what we can do from a technology perspective. And so we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got sufficient stock, so to speak, for any other opportunities that might be M&A related. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. ","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital ","I guess the first one is a question with part clarification. Did I hear correctly that the expectations for blended ASP is to be flat sequentially in the June quarter? And if that\u2019s the case, I guess in the context of the revenue guidance, which is down 5% quarter over quarter, that would sort of put it all on the TAM is the implication, that you\u2019re expecting TAM of $130 million in the June quarter? ","Timothy Leyden ","Yes, we did indicate that the ASP would be flattish, and in line with the seasonality that we\u2019ve historically seen, generally it\u2019s down somewhere in the region of about 4% or so from a quarter over quarter basis. So that\u2019s really where the expectation and the matching of the flat ASP and the revenue guidance is coming from.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital ","And then the follow up is with regard to gross margin. I guess given that there\u2019s sort of similar revenue decline in the June quarter relative to the December quarter, and the mix isn\u2019t tremendously changing, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to capture similar efficiencies? Steve, to your comment, hopefully they continue in the June quarter. And why couldn\u2019t margins be more flattish? Or is the volume, the down sequential TAM, really that big of an impact?","Timothy Leyden ","Yeah, there would be a little bit of a challenge as far as utilization is concerned, when you compare quarter on quarter. So that\u2019s really where the challenge is. From a viewpoint of component reductions, what we\u2019ve seen is that as the volumes stabilize, the component cost reductions have also flattened out a bit, and they\u2019re not as significant as they used to be historically. They\u2019re probably running somewhere in the region of about a half to a third of where they had been previously. So consequently, the utilization takes on a larger significance in that particular mix. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","Just getting back to the SSD business, I guess on a year over year basis, including inorganic activity, you were up 45%. Can you sort of flip that to what kind of organic growth the business is experiencing year on year, and maybe some more color around what was driving it in the most recent quarter? And then sort of expectations for the rest of the year? And then I have a quick follow up.","Timothy Leyden ","There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, and you\u2019ve got SAS and SATA and PCIe, all as [unintelligible]. From what we can glean out of it, it looks like on a year on year basis, that the growth is somewhere north of about 50% or so. So we\u2019re just slightly behind where the total market growth rate is. ","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","And in terms of your own success, is there anything you would point to that\u2019s having a better impact on the market than maybe some of your competitors? Because obviously that\u2019s a significant business for you guys.","Stephen Milligan ","I don\u2019t know if I would call anything out in particular. I think that in a lot of ways, we were, I\u2019ll call it an early investor in this business, going back to really 2008. And this is on the HGST side initially. And that also corresponds to a lot of the work that we did to improve our position in the broader enterprise market period, and have really developed what we\u2019d like to believe are very tight relationships with a number of enterprise customers, and have broad-based knowledge of the enterprise market and the interaction of storage devices with systems and so on.","And that\u2019s bearing fruit. And the added credibility that we happen to provide, it may not be entirely showing up in the numbers as of yet. There is some ramp, and not only that, ongoing product development that we need to do. But that credibility will translate to either legacy sTec products, which basically will go away. I mean, call it HGST products going forward, and then not only that, it will translate to PCIe or Virident related products as well. So I think it\u2019s really just a reflection of our ongoing investments in credibility in the broader enterprise market.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","And then just one real quick question. I know you\u2019re not providing guidance on the second half of the calendar year, but there has been some talk about a return to normal seasonality. If that was sort of a baseline, are there any markets where you feel like you could see that come back? I know you expressed some conservatism around PCs, but is there anything where you feel like you could get a seasonal lift at least, if we\u2019re looking at the model second half of the calendar year?","Stephen Milligan ","I think the one area that we would call out, and I don\u2019t know if it will necessarily be outside of seasonal norms, it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to call that, but obviously we\u2019re expecting a nice rebound in terms of capacity enterprise demand. So there might be a little bit more strength in that market than what we traditionally have seen. And so that\u2019s the indicators that we\u2019re getting \u201ctoday\u201d. We\u2019ll have to continue to validate that as we move through the balance of the quarter. And then we\u2019ll talk more about that when we have our earnings call in three months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ","First off, could you talk about the enterprise pricing trends, both with the web sale companies as well as your traditional enterprise companies? It seems like pricing\u2019s been a bit more aggressive as of late. And that would include the near lines. If you could talk about current pricing trends, and then talk about what you see pricing trends over the next couple of quarters.","Stephen Milligan ","The one thing that\u2019s tricky about the enterprise space as an overall comment, is that the margins are richer. And that\u2019s traditionally been the case for quite a long time. Therefore, there\u2019s more margin to give away, just by definition. These are indicative numbers as opposed to real numbers, but if you\u2019re running 20% gross margins, there\u2019s not as much profit to give away, and so people are going to be more cautious.","When you\u2019ve got higher margin products, and you think that there is an opportunity to drive elasticity, you might be compelled to lower those prices more than you otherwise would. And so as a general statement, I would say that probably in the enterprise space, as we begin to see weakness - this is an overall statement, it\u2019s not a statement about us. I\u2019m not pointing the finger. It\u2019s not anything like that. It\u2019s not intended that way. ","But, you know, people weren\u2019t entirely sure what was going on from a demand perspective. Maybe there was a little bit of a thought, well, maybe there\u2019s elasticity here. So we\u2019re going to maybe look a little bit more at the pricing lever and maybe things got a little bit more aggressive than what made sense. Because there was not the kind of elasticity that you normally would expect.","And so I think that\u2019s kind of maybe what\u2019s happened over the last few quarters. Going forward, the reality of it is that pricing is always difficult to predict. It just is. And obvious statement, but no one individual or no one individual company controls pricing. And there\u2019s a lot of factors that go into that. ","The market continues to be competitive, and we are working very closely with all of our customers to find different ways to continue to help them solve the issues that they\u2019re working on to help them create value, whether that be through innovative products, innovative technology, and also making sure that the products are at a cost point for them that makes sense depending upon the economics that they\u2019re trying to drive in their business. ","So there\u2019s a lot of dynamics that go into pricing, but I do think that given the larger margin pool, it\u2019s a little bit more tempting for guys who look at taking price down than maybe other segments of the market.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ","And my follow up is related to TAM. And I\u2019d like to follow up on Ananda\u2019s question. The seasonal guide for June is a little less than seasonal, and I think [unintelligible] Seagate and WD, that\u2019s what it would suggest. What is driving that? Is it the hangover from [SV], or is it the enterprise [near line drive] that\u2019s causing a little less seasonal in June? And [unintelligible] part of the question is, Seagate talked last night about 140 to 145 for the back half of the year. Is that kind of a range you\u2019re comfortable with in the September and December quarters? [unintelligible]","Stephen Milligan ","We\u2019re forecasting revenue generally down 4% on a quarter over quarter basis. That, from our perspective, is pretty consistent with normal seasonality. And so I would not intend that that\u2019s outside of the norms of what we\u2019ve seen historically. And overall, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re really seeing any particular dynamics in a given market, other than the gaming market continues to be healthy. That\u2019s just a good thing in terms of volume absorption and that kind of thing. So that\u2019s kind of helping us a bit.","So I wouldn\u2019t really call [anything out] there. And then what was the second part of your question? I\u2019m sorry.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ","The 140 to 145 range in the second half of the year for the TAM. Does that feel reasonable?","Stephen Milligan ","I\u2019d prefer not to go there, honestly. I think it\u2019s a little bit too early. We\u2019re certainly expecting a seasonal uptick in our business in the back half of the year. There\u2019s still a fair amount of uncertainty out there, and I don\u2019t want that to come across as an overly negative statement. ","It\u2019s more just to be cautious, and that\u2019s kind of the way that we manage our business. There is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty out there. What\u2019s really happening in the PC market? How long is this refresh cycle going to have? ","And I\u2019m afraid of saying all this, because I\u2019ll scare everybody. You know, there\u2019s a fair amount of geopolitical things out there. China is still kind of soft overall. Russia provides a little bit of uncertainty, how\u2019s that going to play out. ","And I think it\u2019s just a little bit too early to call exactly how calendar Q3 and Q4 are going to look, other than we think we\u2019re reasonably comfortable that it\u2019s going to be seasonally up, pretty much along the lines of what we typically see.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. ","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","One, maybe if you could just touch on the inventory side. A healthy spike in the finished goods inventory on a sequential basis. Could you talk about what\u2019s driving that given the fact that you\u2019re actually looking for a downtick in TAM in the June quarter?","Timothy Leyden ","So if you look at our business, and look at the cash flow, we had very good linearity during the course of the quarter. And we used that linearity in order to be able to avoid capital expenditure. Because it means that we\u2019re able to avoid spikes. So that\u2019s one thing.","The second thing is, we\u2019re putting quite a lot of product on the ocean, and from a funding viewpoint, and from an investing viewpoint, and from a return on investment, that is proving to be a very good ROI. We did take something in the region of about $60 million in absolute terms out of the work in process, and our [raw] was almost flat. ","So when we look at how we\u2019re executing the business, it\u2019s a mix of making sure that, as we kind of bypass an expenditure through linearity, we can then avoid costs through putting product on the ocean. And as we put it on the ocean, it means that we carry that inventory for something in the region of six to eight weeks or so. So it does have an impact on our finished goods. ","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets ","And then a second question, I guess when I look at the total exabytes shipped on a capacity basis, it looks like that number is about 10% both year over year and also on a rolling four quarter basis. That seems to be below kind of what the expectation is, at least I would have had on that number. So how do we think about that as we go into the back half, especially when you\u2019re expecting this enterprise pick up. Does it remain here? Or do you think it gets back to this 20% to 30% range.","Stephen Milligan ","So there\u2019s a few things that are impacting that. The first thing that I think is important is that overall growth in data, which is a little bit difficult to get exact numbers on it, but [unintelligible] the analysis that we\u2019ve got is tracking to our expectations. So it\u2019s not an issue, the exabyte growth issue is not reflective of overall content creation, if you want to call it that.","The other thing is that some of the numbers that we have been talking about historically, let\u2019s call it a 25% growth, rounding off to 25% growth, in exabyte volumes. That had certain assumptions related to the PC market, both from a volume perspective as well as from a capacity mix perspective. ","What we\u2019re seeing is one, volumes have generally speaking been less than what we had previously assumed. The other thing is that our PC customers are not mixing up to higher capacity points as much as we normally have seen. Really, one, because they\u2019re trying to hit certain cost points, and also, aerial density growth is not progressing as much as what we have historically seen. So that, because of the large volume that the PC market tends to have, has an oversized impact on that 25%, reconciling it back to the 10% number that you\u2019re talking about. ","And then on the last factor that I will cite, is that some of these recent changes that we\u2019ve seen in terms of the capacity enterprise market, where we\u2019re seeing more softness than what we previously expected, because of efficiencies that they\u2019re realizing, that\u2019s also had an impact. And we would expect to see that that will begin to improve in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. ","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","I just wanted to get some of your thoughts on M&A. You mentioned M&A as a possible use of cash going forward. Obviously you\u2019ve been doing a lot of stuff on the SSD side, but would you look at things like moving up the stack into the storage stack, like Seagate has done with the Xyratex acquisition? ","Stephen Milligan ","As a general statement, not necessarily speculating on would we do something exactly like what Seagate\u2019s done, but we will continue to look at ways that we can add value throughout the enterprise stack. So it may or may not perpetuate itself potentially as exactly with Xyratex\u2019s acquisition, but yes, that is certainly an area where we\u2019re working with our customers and have active dialog in terms of well, what are different ways that we could add value? And there\u2019s nothing conclusive there. But that is a meaningful opportunity for us from a business perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First, on the hybrid side, you\u2019ve talked about that as being a 2014 story for WD. Can you maybe give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about that market develop? And then secondly, I\u2019m sorry to keep hitting on the enterprise side, but how much visibility do you have when the capacity guys are coming to you with forecasts? How comfortable are you with looking out with that. You know, I\u2019m asking that around the context of you\u2019re expecting a second half increase, but it\u2019s been a pretty disappointing segment all in all over a few quarters, or some would even argue a year. So just wondering if you could sort of help us understand that dynamic.","Stephen Milligan ","On the hybrid side, frankly it hasn\u2019t been as compelling of a product, or has not tracked to our original expectations. And I think that is not only a WD statement, but is also frankly largely an industry statement. One of the things that we\u2019re continuing to focus on is trying to figure out how that value equation translates or sells, not only with our customers, who in this case would be traditional PC OEMs, but also to the end customer. ","And so we\u2019re going to continue to work on that. There are different alternatives that we\u2019re looking at, including what should the pricing be, or what does the cost point need to be, what capabilities, etc., and also talking to our customers about how can they package it in such a way that it translates to compelling value from a customer perspective.  But the reality is that the sales level, the revenue level, have been disappointing versus our original expectations. And it\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate.","Now, to be honest, our revenue expectations were not that significant anyway, and so it doesn\u2019t have that significant of an impact on our financial results, but it is something that we need to continue to focus on and make decisions on going forward, particularly in terms of investment otherwise.","On the enterprise side, what\u2019s actually happening, to address your question in terms of visibility, what was going on before is that our enterprise customers, or capacity enterprise customers, particularly the hyperscale ones, were either carrying more inventory than they needed, or we were carrying inventory for them, because they didn\u2019t have as much visibility, and so their supply lines or deployment schedules were kind of inefficient. ","What\u2019s happened is that they\u2019ve become more efficient, which is actually, other than the short term demand driver that we\u2019ve seen, good for our business in the sense that we believe, and this is something that needs to be tested out as we move forward, that there\u2019s going to be improved visibility, less inventory carried through the entire supply line, and that will be good for our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. ","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird ","Just a follow up to that last topic, Steve. How much does new product, 6 TB and helium, play into elongated test and [unintelligible] cycle? Does that create a pause at all? I wasn\u2019t sure if that was included in your remarks about efficiency. ","Stephen Milligan ","Are you talking about a pause in terms of demand?","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird ","That\u2019s right, a quarter or two of delay as those buyers get their arms around how to deploy the product.","Stephen Milligan ","Not so much. I mean, maybe at the margins, but not that significantly. It\u2019s still relatively low volume within the whole grand scheme of things. And it\u2019s being worked in in terms of a normal deployment schedule. And frankly, we\u2019ve been talking to our customers about the 6 TB and when it was going to come out for a while, so it\u2019s been worked into their planning cycle. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s anything particularly unusual related to that that\u2019s impacting the number of units that our customers are pulling from us in the capacity enterprise space.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird ","And as a follow up, on the branded, down with seasonality, as expected. I think there\u2019s a media push there. Are you happy so far with what you see in the network attached personal cloud market?","Stephen Milligan ","Yes, we are.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird ","Any additional color on the opportunity?","Stephen Milligan ","Well, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. We\u2019re going to have to continue to invest. We\u2019re going to have to continue to make the product more and more compelling, I\u2019ll call it from a software perspective. And so it has been a good product for us. We\u2019ve had some service issues. We\u2019ve addressed those. We\u2019re investing in that. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we deliver on the product offering that we\u2019re putting out there. But the initial reactions to it have been very positive. It\u2019s serving a purpose, filling a market need. And so we\u2019re very excited about it, but we\u2019ve also got more work to do in terms of continuing to make the product compelling as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. ","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","I\u2019d like to follow up a little bit more on the branded side. It looks like the revenue and units were both down year over year, as well as ASPs. Can you walk through why you\u2019re seeing this trend, especially in the context of the My Cloud seems to be getting good traction here?","Timothy Leyden ","As we\u2019ve gone through the years, there\u2019s been more of a concentration on 2.5 inch versus 3.5 inch, and 3.5 inch does have higher price. So from a mix viewpoint, there is an increasing percentage of the total is 2.5 versus 3.5, and that contributes to the dampening of the price. That\u2019s mainly what causes that.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research ","And can you talk about why you actually saw the year over year declines on the revenue and units?","Timothy Leyden ","I don\u2019t think that the growth numbers have been as we would have expected, and I\u2019m talking about total TAM. So consequently, we participated in that. And Toshiba has taken a bit more market share in some parts of the world, primarily through aggressive pricing. And we\u2019re selective in how we compete in there, but the market growth we expect is going to get back as the products become more compelling. What we\u2019ve done is participated selectively and tried to keep the market share that we\u2019ve had.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research ","Taking into account Toshiba\u2019s aggressiveness, then do you see that the TAM for branded has been expanding for the March quarter? Or was that flat, or could that still contract?","Timothy Leyden ","We think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for external drive attachment as we go forward, particularly as handheld devices and other devices don\u2019t have that much storage integrated into them. So it\u2019s a changing market, but there are lots of opportunities there, and together with direct attach, NAS, and also wireless, I think there\u2019s big opportunity for us to be able to capitalize on the continuing trend towards mobility. But so far, I think it\u2019s been more anemic that we would have expected or liked it to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","I wanted to ask about gaming. How long does the cycle go? Initially, I think you\u2019d assume you get an initial uptick with the early adopters, then kind of ease. And I think at one point, we said September would be the peak, and December held up, March held up. It sounds like June will be okay. So going forward, does the cycle play out with a long runway, or can this market potentially change on a dime and see orders pulled abruptly if things slow quickly?","Stephen Milligan ","That\u2019s a very good question, and the reality is, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. And part of the reason I don\u2019t know the answer to that is because our customers don\u2019t know at this point. I mean, the demand has been very strong. There\u2019s a lot of bullishness there. And so we don\u2019t know exactly how long the cycle is going to go. Now, that being said, just as an example, the models will last for quite a while. It\u2019s just units will continue to be produced. It\u2019s just a matter of at what volume.","And so we\u2019re going to have to continue to monitor that and keep you abreast of how we\u2019re seeing the gaming volumes play out. But right now, there is a fair amount of bullishness on behalf of our customers regarding the new gaming consoles.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research ","And then finally, on the My Cloud, you kind of talked around this, Steve, but the service outages. Do you think you kind of nipped it in the bud quick enough where there\u2019s no near term market dynamics that shake out because of it?","Stephen Milligan ","We haven\u2019t seen anything regarding that. It has apparently not had any impact on our sales. That being said, we take these things very seriously, and certainly did our best to respond as quickly as we can, and have attempted to take preventative actions to minimize the risk of that happening again. But so far, knock on wood, we have not seen any direct impact on the units that we\u2019re selling.","Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward.

Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.","Robert Blair","I want to mention at the outset that we'll be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the December quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the December quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.","In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to insurance proceeds related to the Thailand flooding and expenses related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.","[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of today's call.","I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.","Stephen D. Milligan","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our September quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter.","The Western Digital team performed well in the September quarter. Outstanding linearity again helped drive great operating results, including strong free cash flow generation. We posted gross margins above the midpoint of our model range and our earnings per share were well above the high end of our guidance. These results reflect continued strong execution by both our HGST and WD subsidiaries. We expect the TAM in the December quarter to be roughly flat with the September quarter. Longer term, we remain excited about the opportunity to address the 34% annual growth in data that we are forecasting through 2020.","Our strong financial performance has enabled us to invest in and execute on a strategic plan that we first outlined a little more than a year ago at our Investor Day. At that time, we identified growth opportunities in the cloud, in thin and light devices and in the Connected Life for consumers and the small and home office market. In addition, we cited Enterprise Solid-State Storage as an evolving growth opportunity. We also defined the capital allocation program of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders and potentially investing the remainder in strategic growth opportunities. We have advanced each of these initiatives over the last year, putting ourselves in an even stronger position to create additional value through innovation and differentiation.","First, in our core business. We are on track to launch our new 7-disk helium-based sealed-drive this quarter to a select group of customers who value the total cost of ownership savings delivered by this innovative product. We are participating in the thin and light ultra portable device opportunity with a strong lineup of solutions, including our solid-state hybrid drives, as well as our 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter hard drives.","We recently introduced our My Cloud family of personal cloud solutions, which enable users to organize, centralize and access their digital content from anywhere in the world. And to further strengthen our participation in the fast-growing SOHO NAS space, we recently expanded our industry-leading family of WD Red NAS drives to include a 3.5-inch 4 terabyte drive and a 2.5-inch form factor.","In returning capital to shareholders, we have delivered on our year ago announcement by allocating approximately $1.2 billion to share buybacks and dividend payouts. On the strategic investment front, we recently strengthened our enterprise storage platform, with several acquisitions related to the application of solid-state storage and data center architectures. SSD in the enterprise and cloud is forecasted by IDC to grow from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $7.2 billion in 2017. We entered the space in 2008 through our joint development agreement with Intel, and since then have established a strong position in SaaS SSD devices. Our recent acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident augment HGST's existing Enterprise SSD resources, including the Intel JDA. Collectively, these assets provide us with a powerful platform to address this evolving growth space with a broadened portfolio of products and technologies, including the full range of Enterprise SSD devices, PCIe, SAS and SATA. Mike Cordano, who heads our HGST subsidiary, will be discussing their data center strategy in the keynote address at the annual Needham storage conference on November 6.","I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang to review the first quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Thank you, Steve. We are very pleased with our September quarter performance, as we again demonstrated the consistency and strength of our business model, underpinned by great execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 139 million units during the September quarter, up from the June quarter and flat with the year ago period. The September TAM came in at the upper end of the guidance we gave in July.","In our business, we saw strength in consumer electronics due to gaming, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and enterprise, and an anticipated seasonal pickup in branded products. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains very lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels.","Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.8 billion, including $106 million from Enterprise SSDs. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 62.6 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter change in overall ASP was primarily driven by a change in business and product mix.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8%, excluding $36 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from HGST, sTec and VeloBit, as well as $11 million of fixed asset impairments and other charges. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 70 basis points, primarily due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected cost improvement.","R&D and SG&A spending totaled $533 million for the September quarter. SG&A included the following items: charges of $13 million related to the acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident, and $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST and sTec intangible assets, offset by a gain of $65 million for a flood-related insurance recovery. We incurred additional interest charges of $13 million in the September quarter relating to the accrued arbitration award.","Tax expense for the September quarter was $37 million, or 7% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $495 million, or $2.05 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million, or $2.12 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding sTec was $2.14, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.09.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $680 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $544 million. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter with free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our CapEx for the September quarter totaled $136 million, or 3.6% of revenue. Part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $150 million during the September quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the quarter. We exited Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which $1.4 billion was in the U.S. During the quarter, we drew down the $500 million available to us through our revolving credit facility.","I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect the total available market to be flat with the September quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.775 billion to $3.875 billion. Gross margin approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $595 million, including a full quarter of sTec and VeloBit, as well as 9.5 weeks of Virident and excluding the amortization of intangibles. Our tax rate was in our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately $242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.10 for the December quarter. This EPS guidance includes a dilutive effect from our recent acquisition of approximately $0.10. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015.","In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance, and we are excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market.","In my final call as CFO of Western Digital, I want to say that I greatly value my 18 years of experience and relationships at the company, including relationships with many of you in the investment community. Most importantly, I want to extend a special thank you to my fellow employees for the great teamwork in building such an outstanding company with such great promise.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The questions on -- as you look at the free cash flow generation, I know you mentioned 7 consecutive quarters at more than $500 million. As we look out going forward, do we believe that, that's a sustainable trend, especially now that we bring on the acquisitions that you guys have done? And how are you thinking about, I guess, in that context, that free cash flow generation? And any thoughts on changing whether or not the 50% return of that free cash flow is kind of -- enters into the equation with these acquisitions behind you?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's certainly the target, to keep the free cash flow up there, if we execute to our business model. Again, the acquisitions we're targeting to have accretive in the early part of calendar year '15. So we also think we have opportunities on the conversion cycle, for instance, on inventory turns. So it's clearly the objective and there is no change to the capital allocation strategy.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, Aaron, this is Steve. Just to clarify one thing, when we're talking about free cash flow, we're defining it as exclusive of the acquisition itself, right?","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Of course.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, if we were to go and look at ASPs, excluding the consumer electronics impact, can you give us a sense on what that might be? Then I have a follow-up.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I don't have the exact number here in front of me, Rich, but it's safe to assume that the majority of the ASP quarter-over-quarter change came from the gaming business that was included in the CE this quarter.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Would you also expect it to be material to the average gigs per chip?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","It reduces the average gigabyte chip.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitions, given their impact here, would you expect that after the December quarter for the OpEx level to decline? I mean, are you basically assuming in the December quarter that you really haven't had a chance to rationalize those businesses? And then any comments on product roadmap rationalization are we even -- know what they're offering today on how you're going to combine the, really, 4 SSD entities in terms of products available to the public.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, I'll take the first part. We said when we announced the Virident acquisitions that our OpEx will peak somewhere in the 595, 590 range. That's where we are right now. We're going to be realizing some savings there over time. We're going to be very prudent to make sure that we're not impacting the roadmap. And I'll let Steve talk about the second part of the question.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, Rich, given that, particularly, the Virident transaction just closed last week, we are still in the process of rationalizing the roadmap for the various product lines, so no update at this point on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I guess, this is for Steve and for Wolfgang, what would need to happen or how would you guys envision dynamics taking place going forward? [indiscernible] the gross margin because of the higher end of the range, and what would be the confluence you think you should get to gross margin to the higher -- and I guess the upper half of the range over time? And I have a follow-up, as well.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, that's an interesting question, sort of difficult to answer in a real straightforward way because generally, the thing that has driven gross margins up to the higher end of the range is supply-and-demand imbalances. And so obviously, we need to see some sort of a pickup from a demand perspective, and then presumably a supply constraint. We don't see that at present. But nevertheless, if we look at our margin performance, we're actually very pleased that our margins are where they're at and in an environment with, frankly, pretty sluggish demand, a pretty flat TAM that we've seen over several quarters. And so that's a testimony to the effort of our teams in terms of bringing down cost, managing mix and also moderating pricing pressure that we've seen.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And then if I could just follow up on that. With regard to capacity utilization, as we sort of think into 2014, calendar 2014, can you give us some sense of how you guys, strategically, are thinking about managing your capacity, say, in an environment where, for instance, be a flattish environment going through '14? Would you look to hold it flat? Would you look to actually -- do you think to increase capacity utilization? How do you guys are thinking about it?","Stephen D. Milligan","We've been very proactive in terms of managing our capacity. Our infrastructure and our capacity utilization to the reduced TAM environment that we've seen over the last several quarters in terms of -- because the TAM was $160 million, $170 million in that range. Now it's in the, call it, $135 million to $140 million. And so we're keeping a close eye on that in terms of where that might go. And if for some reason or another the TAM were to contract, we would again take proactive measures to make sure that we're managing our capacity appropriately. And right now, we don't have any plans to expand our capacity until we begin to see some indication that the market's going to pick up that would support that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you guys give us some more color on what you saw in terms of enterprise demand during the quarter, particularly in the business-critical segment and how you're thinking about that going into the fourth quarter?","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, demand in the enterprise space, it was a little bit stronger in the performance enterprise, or business-critical segment as you refer to it, than what we expected. Frankly, we're not entirely sure what drove that. And so -- but a little bit stronger. We -- our share was a little bit off. And so -- but that's not reflective of long-term performance. Capacity enterprise was about where we called it. So generally, not too far off.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how about the competitive landscape, obviously, you said the share was a bit off, but do you see any major change in terms of the competitive landscape, particularly heading into fourth quarter?","Stephen D. Milligan","I wouldn't call anything out. I think it continues to be as competitive as it's been in the past. But I don't think that there's anything particularly unusual right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","With regard to notebook units, it looks like they were down about 11.5% year-on-year, which was a bit more than we are expecting, I guess. Can you provide any color on what dynamics are impacting that segment?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, like I said in my prepared remarks, there is -- there's always -- we're always looking at the inventory at the OEMs as well and notebook drive shipments will not always coincide with PC systems shipments that leads us to the conclusion that both for us and for the market that the inventories at the OEMs are very, very reasonable.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Any color you can provide in terms of what to expect in the December quarter or perhaps the full year?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, we expect for the December quarter as we said a knowable [ph] TAM that's flat. We'll see client flattish with the enterprise flat to slightly up. Our branded products seasonally go up a bit into the December quarter, and then CE will ease off a little bit as the gaming systems that are being built, already use a little bit.","Stephen D. Milligan","So just to add a little bit to that, I mean, there's been a fair amount of commentary, I guess, I'll call it that, in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. We are seeing some sign of -- or hearing of some signs may be the better way of characterizing it, of a little bit of a pickup in terms of commercial notebook market. There is still cautious stance or position on the consumer side, particularly as we enter the holiday period. Those are kind of offsetting themselves right now in terms of dynamics because we're still seeing a year-on-year decline in terms of PC shipments, particularly in the notebook space. I think it's a little bit too early from our perspective to call this a -- I'll call it turnaround in terms of what's happening in the commercial space. I mean, there's some data points out there. We'll have to see how sustainable that is. And so we're taking a relatively cautious view until we begin to see a little bit more sustainable pickup in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. But there are some very moderate signs of some encouraging points of -- and we just have to see how sustainable that is and how prolonged that might happen to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RNC capital markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk about the inventory build-up was up about 5%, sequentially. It seems like everything was on the raw material side, I'm assuming it has to do somewhat with the acquisition, but maybe you talk about what is organic versus due to stack mostly?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, several -- it's mostly on the raw material side. It's really staging for quarter -- December quarter is usually very, very linear, making sure that we can have the supply line into the customers be very steady. There's a little bit of an impact from the acquisitions as you can imagine. We're also investing actively in FGI. We're using ocean shipments where we can. And again, we're making sure that we're monitoring the demand signals very well so that we have the unit positioned in the just-in-time warehouses where we need them. So we watch the inventory turns very carefully, invest them carefully while watching the overall free cash flow.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the gross margin line, it was impressive, it was up 70, 80 basis points versus expectation despite the mix being severely negative but consumer up significantly. So maybe could you; a, talk about what drove that, and then as you get to December, I suspect the mix is getting better for you given the enterprise should ramp up. So why don't you expect the gross margin improvement into the December quarter given my assumption is mix is going to be better?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, first of all, I mean, we have managed the business to have acceptable gross margins in all the businesses that we serve. In the September quarter, we came in at a TAM that was at the upper end of what we guided to, so we shipped a bit more volume that helped free, in [ph] general, with the cost and the teams have done good work on general cost improvements. And the price declines in the quarter were a little bit lower than we had originally modeled. So it didn't come from one particular cost element or price element. It was like a combination of a few things. And then again going into the December quarter, yes, we have chips branded as up a little bit, CE is down a little bit. That's why we're saying the gross margin is flattish as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I could. One on cash, just the -- so you said, Wolfgang, with $1.4 billion onshore, I guess, just if you look out over the next -- I mean, couple of years, do you see U.S. cash being a limiter to capital allocation plans? And if it was, would you just simply look at raising more debt or repatriating because I'm thinking your offshore cash could be pretty big. Just sort of wondering how you would approach that, and then I have a follow-up if that's okay, unrelated.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","That's a good question. There's several paths to the solution, and we believe with a couple of years runway just from free cash flow that we create in the U.S., plus the opportunity to pay down our current debt and take it on, onshore. If you recall we designed it that way when we made the HGST acquisition. So we have that flexibility in the credit facility. Our leverage ratio with that is at a very modest level. So we have significant incremental debt capacity. And we believe, depending on what we do on the strategic front with our capital allocation strategy that, that will get us through the next couple of years. And then we'll have to see what happens in Washington and -- because this is not a situation that we're in by ourself. It's like 1.6 trillion of U.S. profit trucked offshore. And either there is a change there, or in perpetuity it will be someone repatriating cash and having a tax impact on that.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, it makes sense. And if I could ask an unrelated follow-up, the -- just the strength you've been seeing in enterprise demand especially in the capacity side, do you see that being driven? I mean is that traditional OEM selling into traditional enterprise, or is that sort of cloud type data centers driving the upside? I mean, do you get a sense of -- I'm assuming the latter is certainly helping, but I mean how much is it helping, I guess?","Stephen D. Milligan","Rob, it's a little bit of both but certainly the hyperscale guys build out, from a cloud infrastructure standpoint helps a lot with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up to the last question, will it be possible to give us some idea on these hyperscale landscape cloud properties? How big is the revenue stream from them, maybe as opposed to digital [ph] to enterprise revenue, to total revenue?","Stephen D. Milligan","At present, we don't provide that information.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then if I look at your Enterprise SSD revenues, which you just reported this quarter, the quarter-over-quarter sequentially Enterprise SSD revenue is kind of flattish in spite that you have like 3 weeks of stack revenues in NAND [ph], so just kind of wanted to understand that.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, one of the things that we have been seeing in the NAND demand market is some constraints from a supply perspective. We're beginning to see that sort of free up a little bit. And also with the additional acquisitions, I think that we'll see going into the future a more robust quarter-on-quarter growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on linearity, Steve or Wolfgang, you mentioned it was very good. What's behind that? And is that something that we should expect to continue?","Stephen D. Milligan","It's really kind of, fundamentally, the way that we run our business. We really place a lot of importance on cash generation and also managing our build and our inventory levels very closely to the way that our customers pull on product. And also not unnaturally, I'll call it stuffing things in at the end of the quarter. And so it's been something of an -- I can go back to my days at Western Digital back pre 2007, and it was a discipline that existed within Western Digital then. And it's a discipline that we built over time within HGST. And so it's just part of the way that we do business, and I would certainly hope that you'll continue to see the benefits of that from a financial performance perspective.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And as a follow-up, I wanted to try one on the hyperscale cloud buyers. I recognize you can't use names, but any color you can provide on your level of R&D engagement with this community -- visibility you might have? Just wanted to try to understand the depth of the relationship here as -- in general.","Stephen D. Milligan","Yes, I'm trying to think how to dimension that question. I mean, we enjoy very strong relationships with a number of different customers, including many of the hyperscale guys. And we see the benefits of that in our financial results. So I don't know if I can comment beyond that. I apologize for not being able to go deeper, but that's kind of where we're at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to dig a little bit into your expectations for the margins for the SSD business as we go forward. I know you said that you'd expect those businesses to be accretive, and I think you said early 2015. What type of margins would you expect those to be in line with, Western Digital's corporate margins, or do you think they'll be higher than that as we move into fiscal '15?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, first of all, we're managing our business based on ROIC. So the margins by business line greatly depend on what CapEx, and what we're putting into a business. But we believe, based on the roadmap that we have outlined now, that we have all the assets of sTec, Virident and VeloBit that we'll get to a gross margin profile that's around the current corporate profile.","Stephen D. Milligan","I think the other thing to add is that as we have added capability in terms of our Enterprise SSD products, it also is allowing us to wrap enhanced value around the devices that we're providing. And we refer to that as intelligent devices and that sort of thing and there will be a software component. Those clearly will carry higher gross margins than what our overall corporate average. Now how that moves the needle in terms of our overall gross margin profile I think will depend upon how our growth plays out and how the market also plays out.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And now that you've done a number of acquisitions in the SSD space, do you feel like you have all the tools that you need to compete there, or do you think there are pieces that are missing?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well, we're going to continue to evaluate that. But I think that right now, we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just 2 questions for me. First of all, in the context of wishing Wolfgang good luck, is there any update on the CFO search? And secondly, Steve, just some of your preamble regarding new products, I was curious on the helium drive and the ultraportable products, are you saying that you're shipping in this quarter or can you just clarify timing for commercial revenues?","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure, in terms of the CFO update, our CFO search, no update -- search is continuing. And so that's where we're at with that. And then on the new product front, we will be realizing revenue this quarter related to the 7-disk helium product. And we are currently shipping and realizing revenue, of course, on our 5-millimeter, 7-millimeter products, as well as hybrid versions.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Okay, and any I don't know, just pushing it a little bit but is there any comment in terms of how that is ramping or what type of products you are having the most success with on the mobile side?","Stephen D. Milligan","Well Peter, if you'll recall, when we talked about -- and I'll talk about the hybrid product, that was really -- we were envisioning that more of a 2014 story. So at present, the volumes and the revenue are not that significant, but that's consistent more or less with what we were expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was hoping you could give us an update on, a, the timing; and b, the range of scenarios or outcomes as it relates to your discussions with MOFCOM. And then I have a follow-up, please.","Stephen D. Milligan","The timing and what else did you --","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The potential range of outcomes and what I mean by that is there are different scenarios on the potential size or magnitude of release?","Stephen D. Milligan","Sure, so the timing is that we have the opportunity to remind everybody 2 years after the closing of the transaction. So coming up here in March in 2014, we have the opportunity to -- I'll call it reapply to MOFCOM to have them reconsider the whole separate arrangement that we have. At this point, we -- it's too early to speculate. And it's also too early to speculate in terms of the range of outcomes. And not to sound facetious, but your guess is as good as mine in terms of what that might look like. That being said, we are encouraged in terms of our ongoing relationship with MOFCOM in terms of our compliance and also beginning discussions in terms of the reapplication process.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, so then my follow-up is seasonality for the March quarter, I think with a flat kind of TAM in December, you're -- I think the PC industry has been experiencing less of a seasonal bump in December quarter. I think that there also might be some opportunities to have less of a seasonal down in the March quarter, given where the drives are ending up or the PCs are ending up more in Asia with Chinese New Year and whatnot, but I just wanted to see if you wanted to provide us with some initial thoughts at least on how you're approaching seasonality in the March quarter off of that TAM in December.","Wolfgang U. Nickl","I'll probably start it off with just how historically the TAM behaved. What we do know is that our branded business is declining a little bit. We have still a strong January and February, but then it's quarter-over-quarter a little bit down. Also, the CE business is quarter-over-quarter down a little bit, again mostly related to the gaming build. In terms of enterprise, we see that market steadily growing. And then the PC business is the one to watch. Historically, it is flat to slightly down going into the March quarter. But again Steve mentioned that there are some signs of a commercial pickup. We just got to watch that very, very carefully and then just do what we always do, react to the downside or to the upside.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Any commentary you can provide or any numbers rather on like-for-like ASP declines, or if no specific numbers, at least talk about which subsegments saw lesser like-for-like declines in your expectations in which you may have seen more?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Well, I think the only piece that's useful here is like-for-like price decline was less than the like-for-like cost decline, and therefore, our gross margin increased. So we didn't see anything extraordinary in any of the markets as we drove past down we ship that was how [ph] customers but there wasn't anything extraordinary in anything.","Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then on OpEx, I understand you're not guiding for the synergies you're going to have from the deals, but can you confirm that from where we sit today that the December quarter will likely be your near-term peak from a dollar basis?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, that's the intent. I mean, we're not going to shut down an investment or make a hasty decision if we're not clear on the roadmap but that's the intent like we outlined on the Virident announcement call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moscowitz with JPMC.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to fall back on the CapEx topic. Steve, what's your view at some point, do you have to start spending more in CapEx just for next-generation technologies and could that provide any sort of incremental lift to CapEx or has it kind of already streamlined into the model just given your continuous investments in technology?","Stephen D. Milligan","We're investing today in next-generation technology, so I think it's kind of embedded in the numbers that we're seeing already. There may be some investments that come that may -- I mean, it's nominal in terms of the impact, in terms of certainly our CapEx range, and then maybe some big piece of equipment we have to do a particular quarter or whatever. But we are not delaying anything in terms of new capital investments from a technology perspective to drive our free cash flow generation unnaturally in the short term.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so there's nothing on the horizon that could surprise us 6 to 9 months out?","Stephen D. Milligan","No, not anything that I have visibility on right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","I'd like to also talk about CapEx here. As a percent of revenue, it was around 4% for your second quarter in a row, which is below your target model of 5% to 7%. So are we looking at a new level of CapEx? And if so, why is that? And then also can you talk a little bit longer-term about in the context of potentially a flattish unit growth environment, but ahead in planner [ph] growth, how would that also affect your CapEx rate?","Wolfgang U. Nickl","Yes, it's like, like Steve said, really, I mean, there's always different elements of CapEx in our model, and right now, we just don't need to spend on capacity. And we're spending on things like tool upgrades for new aerial density, we're spending on technology, we're spending on solidifying our supply chain, for instance, we now have 2 slide effects on the WD side. There's no reason to update our CapEx model right now and the final outcome for the fiscal year will really depend on what our view is at the tail end of the fiscal year in regards to the demand. In terms of head and media [ph] account, I do think that both of our subs -- the situation where the demand for gigabytes will outstrip what the technology can deliver on aerial density growth. So naturally, the head and media [ph] count will likely go up over the years, so that will first improve the utilization of our current assets and then at one point in time, drives us to do some incremental investments in capacity.","Stephen D. Milligan","But right now in terms of our component utilization in terms of from a capacity perspective, that's probably the area where we are the most underutilized. Part of that has to do with the hold separate situation. In other words, there's certain degree of mismatches between the 2 units. And so we're actually pretty comfortable, as a general statement, with where we're at and if component counts go up, and then depending upon what happens in terms of the hold separate situation, we think we'd be able to optimize our component utilization without necessarily adding loss of capital.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC","So at the end of the day, is there room to potentially move below the target model if demand does not tick up on a year-to-date [ph] basis?","Stephen D. Milligan","I think that's something that we have to continue to evaluate, but I think it's a little bit too early to make that call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sterling with Barclays.","Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering, how far out would you say, call it, half a year, 1 year until we can maybe get OpEx closer towards the long-term operating model?","Stephen D. Milligan","It's going to depend upon -- we've said in the past that in order to get into the 10% to 12% range of operating expense, it would require us to be able to realize synergies as it relates to the combination of WD and HGST. And so as long as the hold separate situation persists in the current form, we'll continue to operate at a higher level of OpEx than what our target range is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Yoo with Citigroup.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Guidance if I could. As you know, Nidec and LSI both guided to...","Unknown Executive","Joe could you start over -- you cut off at the beginning?","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I mean, just wanted to get some clarification on the TAM guidance. As you know, Nidec and LSI, your suppliers both guided to a TAM closer to $135 million for the December quarter. And historically, obviously, WD has been more conservative on the TAM guidance versus others. So could you help us understand the discrepancy a little?","Stephen D. Milligan","I'm not sure if I can help you with that, because I don't know the basis for Nidec or LSI. But undoubtedly, my guess is it has something to do with their unique view and they're also one step removed from a supply chain perspective. So it may be something to do with an inventory situation or what-have-you that they're saying. So I don't -- I'm not sure I can clarify that. But we carefully evaluate where we think the TAM's going to turn out. And I may say this and end up being wrong, but I think that we've done a pretty good job historically calling the market.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and my follow-up is maybe if you could provide some color on the adoption of hybrids among OEMs. Are you expecting any meaningful volume as you head into year end?","Stephen D. Milligan","I commented on that earlier in terms of we really think it's, for us, it's more of a 2014 story.","In closing, I want to thank all employees for their dedication and outstanding performance in Q1, and our customers and our suppliers for their support. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and all of our employees, I want to thank Wolfgang very much for his outstanding contributions and service to the company and wish him the very best in his new venture, which he begins in early December.

We will then take your questions.","We demonstrated the power of our platform with record non-GAAP financial results in the December quarter. I am very pleased that we achieved a year-over-year revenue growth in each of our end market categories. We reported revenue of $5.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95. We once again generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets most notably for capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.","Entering the new calendar year, there are several noteworthy trends as we pursue our long-term value creation strategy. The global economic environment is healthy; the GDP growth rates in the U.S., China and the EU are positive, portending significant IT spending. Data has been created at a record pace worldwide and the value of data is increasing too driven by advancements in mobility, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The unabated growth in data is creating a global need for a larger and more capable storage infrastructure.","The level of CapEx spending by cloud service providers to accommodate this growth is robust. As Michael addressed in more detail, the healthy pace of data center build out has resulted in a recent reacceleration of demand for a high capacity enterprise hard drives. Against this backdrop, we are well positioned with our powerful platform to enable our broad customer base to capture, preserve, access and transform an ever increasing diversity of data. The flash market is normalizing in a constructed manner as a diversified value-added storage solution provider with a wide breadth of serve markets; we will continue to demonstrate resilience of our model by delivering compelling financial results.","I am very pleased with our progress in technology and product development. The deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND technology continued across our product portfolio and we will be ramping our 96-layers technology later this calendar year. We continue to lead the industry with our high capacity helium platform and we remained on plan to sample our MAMR-based capacity enterprise hard drives in the second half of calendar 2018.","It was gratifying at the end of the calendar year with a resolution of our negotiations with our JV partner Toshiba to extend and strengthen our relationship and ensure our long-term access to flash and I am happy to report that our JV operations continue to perform very well. I am very proud of our team driving and focus on execution and the results they have delivered.","With that, I will ask Mike to share the business highlights.","Mike Cordano","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased that we finished calendar 2017 with strong December quarter results. We executed well across our business with continued strength and demand for our products and solutions. As Steve indicated, we saw year-over-year growth in each of our end market categories, reflecting our power of our platform and addressing a broadening set of markets and customers.","In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven most notably by demand for our embedded flash and client SSD products. We began shipments of our 3D flash-based embedded solutions with a mobile and compute market including our first USF offering allowing us to address our broader market opportunity beginning this calendar year. In addition, we saw continued strong demand for our products and growth areas, such as connected home, surveillance and industrial verticals.","Solid year-over-year revenue increases in Client Solutions highlighted the continued preference for our G-tech, SanDisk and WD brands during the strong holiday season. We made further end roads in our engagement with leading brick-and-mortar and e-tail partners during the December quarter. At CES earlier this month, our products received half a dozen awards, underscoring the ongoing innovation and differentiated value we are delivering to this market.","In Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand for capacity enterprise drives remains strong. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives grew further and the transition to the 12 terabyte capacity point accelerated. We also began shipments of our industry leading 14 terabyte drives, for hyperscale applications during the December quarter.","In terms of exabyte growth in capacity enterprise, as previously indicated, calendar 2017 was the slower period for the market, primarily due to industry-wide component constraints, with an overall exabyte growth rate of slightly less than 30%. However, as we noted in our December conference call, we saw strengthening demand for capacity enterprise drives, as we ended 2017.","In the first half of calendar 2018, we estimated that the year-over-year industry exabyte growth rate will exceed 60% as the pent-up demand is fulfilled. For the full calendar 2018, we estimate exabyte growth to exceed 50%, as broad deployments of capacity enterprise drives are expected to persist throughout the year.","Data center build out by several large hyperscale customers and guided industrial policies are driving significant global infrastructure expansion. These trends are leading to a growing need for capacity enterprise drives in the high end as well as the mid range. Western Digital, the mid range part of the capacity enterprise market has been an area of lower exabyte share.","We have responded to the rising demand for 4 terabyte to 5 terabyte capacity drives, especially in Asia, with our recent introduction of a new range of cost-advantages, air based products. We expect the demand for high and mid range capacity drive to support the higher rate of exabyte consumption in calendar 2018, and our long-term annual exabyte growth estimate is unchanged at 40%.","From an operational standpoint, we expect to achieve further cost and expense reductions, as the hard drive market continues to evolve. For example, we have reduced development expenses in our product portfolio by eliminating future investments and performance enterprise drives and narrowing our client HTD portfolio. Additional actions include our previously announced closures of manufacturing operations in China and Singapore.","Turning to flash joint venture, the ramp of our 64 layer 3D flash technology, BiCS3, progressed well with further improvements in yields and productivity. The mix of our 3D flash bit supply approach 70% exceeding the December quarter with BiCS3 constituting more than 90% of 3D flash bits. Additionally, we commenced initial production of our 96-layer technology BiCS4 and began product shipments to retailers in the December quarter.","We expect to ramp BiCS4 in the second half of the calendar year. From a fab standpoint, as we had announced in December, we will begin our participation in Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche. Fab 6 operations are expected to commence in the next few months with our initial bit output in the third calendar quarter of 2018.","From a flash industry perspective, we estimate bit growth in calendar 2017 was at the low end of the long-term range of 35% to 45% with Western Digital\u2019s growth somewhat higher than the industry given a relative strength in 64-layer 3D flash. In calendar 2018, we estimate industry bit growth to be near the high end of the long-term range due to improving manufacturing yields and continued transition to 3D flash with our growth consistent with the industry.","Before I conclude, let me note that the normalization in flash markets is both expected and beneficial for the industry, creating new opportunities for flash. In fact extended periods of supply constraints limit market adoption and the pace of innovation.","We view this normalization as a part of our business and it is our objective to leverage the strength and breadth of our portfolio to drive the best business outcome in a variety of market condition. In calendar 2018, we expect the Western Digital platform to strengthen further from the planned launches of several new products and solutions and I look forward to providing you further updates in the months ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussions.","Mark Long","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m very pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of market as we capitalize on our diverse product portfolio, increase growth margins and achieved cost and expense target. All of which resulted in significant earnings growth.","We also finished the December quarter with a strong liquidity position, as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation and we made progress on deleveraging and improving our capital structure. We had record revenue for the December quarter of $5.3 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year driven by strong performance in each of our end markets.","Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion. Client Devices was $2.6 billion and Client Solutions was $1.3 billion. Our Data Center business continues to be fueled by cloud related storage demand. Our December quarter revenue for the Data Center Devices and Solutions increased 3% year-over-year. We saw significant growth from capacity enterprise hard drives, which was partially offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives.","Client Devices revenue for the December quarter increased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility, client SSDs and surveillance products. Client Solutions revenue for the December quarter, increased 17% year-over-year mostly as a result of the strength and reach of our valuable global retail brands.","Our non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2% up 655 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply demand environment for flash-based products. Cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.","With respect to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $865 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and the first full quarter of operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. As described in our December call, our operating expenses are higher than our October guidance driven entirely by the over achievement on our six months variable compensation plan.","Our non-GAAP net interest and other expense for the December quarter was $180 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 19%. This includes a $197 million of interest expense for the December quarter, a decrease of $8 million year-over-year primarily from the re-pricing of our debt and the retirement of our euro term loan deep, partially offset by increases in LIBOR, which were approximately 70 basis points on a weighted average basis.","Let me explain the impact of the recent tax reform on Western Digital. We will benefit from the new tax law by having the ability to access our global cash in the U.S. in a highly efficient manner. As a result, we will have greater flexibility with respect to our overall capital allocation and investment decision.","In the December quarter, we booked a provisional net tax charge of $1.6 billion due primarily to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, which is included only in our GAAP results. The payment of this repatriation tax will be spread over the next eight years, which is expected to begin in fiscal 2019 with approximately 60% due in the last three years of the period.","Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be at the high end or slightly above our long-term guidance of 7% to 12%. In the December quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 4% which was lower than our expectations because of the new tax legislation which resulted in a reduced U.S. corporate tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $1.2 billion or $3.95 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $823 million or $2.78 per share driven by the one-time net charge related to tax reform. A GAAP net loss for the period also includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation.","The net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP result is primarily due to charges that have no cash impact within the quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continued to reinvest in our business with $629 million in capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $553 million.","On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 54% year-over-year. We deployed $915 million on capital investments resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $1.4 billion. We paid the previous declared cash dividend totaling $148 million further during the quarter and also declared the dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.","We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalence and available for sales securities totaling $6.4 billion resulting in approximately $7.9 billion of available liquidity including our $1.5 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We repaid our euro term loan B in full and our net debt has decreased approximately $500 million to $5.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business.","We remain committed to the following capital allocation priorities. Organic and inorganic business investments deleveraging, optimizing our cost of capital and capital structure while enhancing our financial flexibility and delivering returns for our shareholders through our dividend and reauthorize share buyback program.","We achieved our planned cost and OpEx synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations within the expected timeframes. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. While we have achieved our synergy target as of the end of the calendar 2017, we will continue to deliver and expense benefits from both of these transactions over the coming years.","I will now provide our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be approximately $4.9 billion consistent with a seasonally weaker fiscal third quarter. Gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. Operating expenses to be between 840 and $850 million which includes the annual payroll tax reset. Interest and other expense to be between 180 and $185 million. The effective tax rate in the 5 to 7% range and our diluted shares to be approximately 309 million.","As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.30. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth, profitability and value creation through industry cycles. While we expect to see normal seasonality in the second half of fiscal 2018, we continue to see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4 to 8% for fiscal 2018.","Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be between $13.50 and $14 for fiscal 2018. For calendar 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth at the high end of our long term model. We also expect that non-GAAP gross margin will be above the high end of our long-term model range of 33% to 38% throughout the year.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","I want to start-off with the longer term question. In the past year, we were destructed by Toshiba. Now that looking forward, I would like to revisit your longer term method that you presented at Analyst Day December of 2016 has been a while. How should we think about those longer term growth and longer term objectives beyond the next few quarters? Is there any change -- is there any change in the strategy? And how do you see the Company evolving with the next few years especially in the context of updating us since you've been kind of absent over the past year or so?","Steve Milligan","Yes so, Mehdi, I would say that there has essentially been no fundamental change to our long-term strategy since we had our Analyst Day and growth rates from an industry perspective, from our perspective remained consistent. We constantly think about, how the market is evolving and changes and relook at our strategy, but I would say that right now there is no real fundamental change.","One other thing that we are contemplating is, does it make sense to have in Investor Day coming up here in the fall. We haven\u2019t made a formal decision on that, but we will certainly from an internal perspective be refreshing our view on everything and providing appropriate updates to our investor base. But as a general statement, there has been no fundamental or big change to either our strategy or the fundamentals as we saw them at our Investor Day.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. But when I look at your segment information especially for December quarter, your Client Devices on a Q-over-Q basis to me was a little below expectation, it was down 1%, and your data center, you have to understand you may have been constrained by NAND shortage. But it doesn\u2019t show the kind of scaling that I thought it would happen maybe 18 months after acquisition of SanDisk, and this is why I was asking for an update. So, is there -- with the Toshiba overhang distraction had an impact? If not, how come we're not seeing the kind of outperformance that should have happened by now?","Steve Milligan","Well, I am not quite sure what numbers you are referring to. So I think we should probably take that offline and maybe dive into it a little bit. But fundamentally I think that, we\u2019re pleased. As Mike indicated, I\u2019ll comment on two things. One, if you want to call being a slight negative in that universe of expectation that we had capacity enterprise, last year grew a little bit less than what we had anticipated, that\u2019s a short-term statement. We talked about the reacceleration that was seemed here in the first half and through calendar 2018. So I would say that our data center and devices business kind of grow a little bit less than what we would expect longer term.","On the positive side, Client Solutions which is a market segment that we had expected to kind of modestly decline over a period of time actually saw extraordinary growth, really speaking to the strength of our market position, the strength of our products or brands, et cetera. So, there is always going to be puts and takes within the particular segment. But on balance I have to say that I am very pleased with the way that the last 12 years, there was no Toshiba overhang from an execution perspective, and as I said, I am extremely proud of what our people have accomplished both from an operating and from a financial perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, if I can, one quick housekeeping question and then one other question. Can you just talk a little bit about where you stand today as far as debt to adjusted EBITDA? And how that relates to your capital return strategy? And then the question is and I\u2019m just curious, if you could address the enterprise SSD market? It didn\u2019t hear a lot about that during the script of the call. I\u2019m just curious of how you characterize your performance there, and if there is anything that we should think about going forward that might change the trajectory of that business?","Steve Milligan","Yes, let me take the enterprise SSD question first. So I think as we\u2019ve stated our product portfolio is sort of execution and expansion would happen in 2018 largely and then also towards the mid to second half of \u201918. So we are continuing to hold serve if you will, but we have more to do at the product level that we expect will become more meaningful, as the year progresses for the mid part of the year summer and beyond.","Mark Long","Yes, with respect to our debt-to-EBITDA, in terms of the way our EBITDA is calculated under our debt instruments, we are now below two times debt-to-EBITDA. So we\u2019re in a very good position, we have achieved a level that gives us strong flexibility in terms of what we want to do from a capital allocation standpoint and we will be evaluating our top priorities and kind of executing accordingly overtime.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","I have a question and a follow-up as well. Maybe we\u2019ll start on the flash side, I think you guys mentioned industry and your bit growth would be at the high end of this 35% to 45% range. That seems fairly in line with, I think, a lot of peers are saying. I\u2019m just wondering though, how do you think of cost per bit decline trajectory as you go through that high end of that range, if you may? And if we do have normalization as you characterize in the flash market in \u201918. What do you think that does to your gross margin structure? Does that -- is normalization a stable driver, outside driver or downside driver to your gross margin?","Mike Cordano","Yes, so we\u2019ve talked about in this new 3D regime, the sort of way to think about annualized cost reduction is approximately 20% per year. I think in our previous call, we talked about our view of the environment is such that ASP declines, if you're seeing some up are largely offset by cost declines. We see that happening in the current period and we expect that to happen going forward.","Steve Milligan","Right, and as I indicated in my guidance for the calendar a year, as a result that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we will operate above our total gross margin model of 33% to 38% for the entire year.","Amit Daryanani","And if I could just follow up Mark, OpEx of March quarter slightly higher than I think what most of us were modeling. I\u2019m just wondering, how much of the payroll tax reset driving that in the March quarter? And then just broadly, how do I think about OpEx through calendar \u201918 for you guys as a range?","Steve Milligan","Good question. So, the rest for payroll tax is something on the order of $15 million or $17 million. And as a result, you can think about a -- I think what we talked about in terms of an $830 million kind of baselines quarterly run rate that we expect to decline and we have the number of activities ongoing to enhance efficiencies, so that that will decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Steve, I was wondering, you spoke about this pretty strong global economic backdrop to data center build out. Obviously, you are guiding on both the high capacity drives as well as NAND on the upside of these ranges. On the NAND side, the 35 to 45 range that you have for bit growth, how much of that is based on this improving economic backdrop? Or are you building in any elasticity of demand once you see this price normalization? And I have a follow-up.","Steve Milligan","Well, I'll answer the question this way. We have been saying and anticipating that the industry is going to grow at that high end of that 35% to 45% range for a while. And so, it really is more of a longer term statement as opposed to something that has changed over the last three to six months because of macroeconomic environment or something like that. And so, it takes a while that we think long-term plan and so we have seen the investment levels be pretty consistent with the growth levels.","The one thing that we have seen recently that is an interesting dynamic is some companies that one are in the DRAM market as well as the NAND market, and then have the flexibility to convert 2D NAND to DRAM, they appeared to be doing that more so. So relative to that 35% to 45% or at that high end, there appears to be a little bit more of a downside by to that as opposed to about that it would exceed that. So we are beginning to see that kind of come down a bit, which is obviously good from a NAND perspective, right.","Mike Cordano","Right, the other thing I'll comment on as we look at the demand side of equation sort of expected capacity upgrades as we progress through the year, and how they translate through the demand cycle for NAND, we think that those numbers, not only are we in sort of a constructive period. As we see the year, we have the possibility of getting into a more constrained environment in the second half of the year.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, I appreciate that color and I try to quickly follow up. You spoke about this hyperscaler pick up. Any color geographically where you are seeing the most activity in the first half of 2018? And what is the average capacity of the drives of these hyperscalers?","Steve Milligan","Yes. So, I think we are seeing strong demand domestically as well as certainly in China that would be the one would stick out to us. Yes, I think and if you look at the capacity point is that general statement, the domestic relative to us here in the U.S., they send to take a highest cap drives. In China, they don't always necessarily take the highest cap drives that then speaks to this area where we had a bit of hole in our product portfolio in terms of 4 to 8 terabyte in air products, which we recently introduced in the air of cost competitive product that will help to better address that portion of the market at least vis-\u00e0-vis our product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Just one or two around gross margins, SEC gross margin, if I could. Just have to clarify, I believe the comment around SEC gross margin in December, was that you guys just hold them flattish, and in flattish I might be paraphrasing, but I think that was the spirit of it. Does that still hold? I just want to check that. And then, what are you guys anticipating for a NAND ASP declines through this year? And I have a quick follow-up on gross margin there. Thanks.","Mark Long","Well, as you can see, our guidance for the quarter for the total gross margin is 42% to 43%. So, we\u2019re looking at very small changes in gross margin and I think it's -- we are seeing as Mike pointed out, some normalization in the flash market, but it's mostly offset from an ASP decline standpoint by the cost declines and as a result our gross margins are healthy.","Steve Milligan","Or relatively stable.","Ananda Baruah","I apologize. I was actually referring to the calendar year \u201918 guide.","Mark Long","Yes, so what we\u2019re seeing, I think in December where we talked about was being in a position where we would maintain total gross margins above the long-term range that we\u2019ve talked about, and that\u2019s certainly the case with respect to the trajectory of flash gross margins. I think the latest commentary I think you heard from Mike suggests that -- again while we may have some declines in gross margin -- remember some of declines in our total gross margin are also going to be a function of the seasonally weaker first half of the calendar year.","And then in terms of the visibility in to the back half, as Mike pointed out, the gross margin trajectory will be a function of on the flash side how much this tightness in the market materializes. So, at this point, we continue to feel that it is a constructive market and as Mike pointed out there is this potential for tightening which would certainly have a positive effect on gross margin.","Ananda Baruah","What\u2019s your sort of base case expectation for NAND ASP declines for calendar \u201918?","Mark Long","We haven\u2019t disclosed that.","Steve Milligan","Yes, the only thing we\u2019ve said around that is, our expectation would be that the ASP declines would be largely offset by our cost declines and that gives you an idea.","Mike Cordano","Yes, with cost declines being in the 20% range.","Ananda Baruah","Right, okay. Is there any reason to think you\u2019ll be tremendously different from past cycles ASP declines?","Steve Milligan","Well, I think if you look at it that part of what we\u2019re saying is that, yes, it will be different than past cycles, in a positive way, and we try to talk to it and explain it as best to our ability, but it\u2019s a bigger market. So the incremental impact of capacity additions, I think that you are seeing also to some degree that\u2019s conversion from 2D NAND and the DRAM and that\u2019s moderating and I think you are just seeing a more rational set of behaviors economically focus that is resulting and still from volatility but not the same level of volatility that has been seen in the past.","Mark Long","And the maturity of the end market so the secular trends for demand remained strong and I think as Mike highlighted some normalization of the NAND market is actually very healthy because it will open new markets and it will increase demand in those mature markets to the extent of price sense. So we feel that calendar 2018 is a very constructive period and as Steve was highlighting, there were dynamics both on the supply side and on the demand side that you can just go and apply the patterns from previous cycles and think you are going to really get the right outcome for this period.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler","I just wanted to clarify some of the trends in the near line market. So how should we think about the impact of mix? You've talked about selling more mid range drives versus high end and as we think about the entire near line revenue line within your HDD mix, especially going into the first half of the year. Could you remind us the levers there on gross margin between overall HDD volumes for you guys versus mix near line shipment to 60% there? And I have a follow up. Thank you.","Steve Milligan","Yes. So I think the thing to think about is it\u2019s a more diverse market now. So we're -- certainly, we have been focusing our strategy at the highest capacity drive, which remains a robust part of the market. We are now seeing demand across our range of capacities, so from a unit volume perspective, that helps, right. The way to think about leverage through our model though is ultimately about our component utilization.","So, when you think about it most for CapEx on the drive side is tied up in heads and media manufacturing, and whether we can figure those as 12 or 14 terabytes or 8, the combination of those to get to the expected exabyte growth rate remains fairly common. So you are modeling just on contemplate different unit volume scenario than just as sort of historical view to the high cast.","Stanley Kovler","So when I think about the volume impact there versus the overall portfolio coming down. Can you help me understand how the mix shift is going to improve overall ASP as well?","Mark Long","So, we do expect overall ASPs to benefit from a mix standpoint on the HDD side and we as a result, you know we know we have the -- we\u2019ll have some volume declines from a seasonal standpoint and parts of the business. We do -- we see relatively stable gross margins.","Stanley Kovler","If I could ask a separate follow-up on more related to cash, you authorized or I should say reauthorize the buyback program back in November. And then if I look at the outlook for the share count looks about flattish with the current quarter. What are you contemplating in terms of share repurchases there?.","Steve Milligan","Yes, we have not made any public statements about our repurchase plans at this point.","Stanley Kovler","Any sense of timing on that to just provide an update or use of cash?","Mike Cordano","I think we\u2019ve already indicated our priorities. I mean and I don\u2019t want to go through what was already read, but first thing as we invest back in our business, optimize our capital structure, deleverage and repurchases on that list, and it will be contemplated with the a broader set of capital allocation considerations, as we look to drive longer term value creation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Robert Cihra","A clarification and although one question, if that\u2019s alright. The clarification just in your slide you\u2019ve briefly mentioned, and if there is no more development or point back development on performance drives and so, is that like stopping development on 10-K? And does that mean they go end of life or they go end of life at one point or is it just pulling back? I just was wondering if you could give a little info there.","Mike Cordano","Yes, let me be very clear, we have ceased development on 10 and 15-K RPM hard drives. So, our products in the market are the last of our products, and we will obviously manage them through a long tail, but we don\u2019t intend to introduce new products.","Rob Cihra","Can you tell us what that tail might be? Is this a tail of months or years?","Mike Cordano","No it\u2019s a long tail of years.","Rob Cihra","Alright and then if I could ask the actual question. There has just been decent amount of debate frankly for several months now in terms of how much the tightness in demand has helped to drive market and get any obviously you sell both. Can you talk if you think there has been a meaningful equal help for drives or left cannibalization than there would have otherwise been because of tightness? Or do you really think it's had that much impact obviously looking back and then looking forward, if you think that\u2019s about to change it all?","Mike Cordano","Yes, so there is only one real area that, that has had an effect and its really in mobile. So 2.5 inch drives and then we would say it had a modest positive effect on the size of the HDD markets and then looking at rearview mirror. So, our penetration rate if you will flash to HBD is running behind our original expectations. What we see happening this year is more normalizing of that trend.","Steve Milligan","In other words the penetration of SSD in notebook based configurations will accelerate, right, which we are agnostic to positive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Karl Ackerman","I actually wanted to focus on your progress and strategy of your systems business, particularly now that you have had some time to integrate Tegile in your operations in addition to your JV with Unis over a year ago now that strengthens your opportunity to go after Asia hyperscale players, who actually have a large contribution to the increasing global hyperscale CapEx. So could you elaborate on what you have done so far to integrate those businesses? And whether or not you actually have all the pieces in your portfolio, you like to target this area of the storage market? And I have a quick follow-up please.","Steve Milligan","Sure. Yes, so I think the recent acquisition of Tegile was a positive step forward across all markets, but particular to your question on China because the adoption of object storage in China is lagging slightly so the ability to have a file front end and be able to lead with the product is more mature in the market then pages to our participation in the China market.","So I think from an overall portfolio standpoint, we are encouraged by the addition of the product that came to the Tegile acquisition. We continue to make steady progress although we don\u2019t talk specifically about the growth rate and size of that. It is growing sequentially and we\u2019re making good progress and I think we\u2019re happy with the results, particularly in the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve added the addition of these file all flash or ray products to our portfolio.","Karl Ackerman","As a follow-up, I would appreciate if you could elaborate on how much your cost saving assumption in your NAND business adhere includes the qualification of your internal NAND supply in your own enterprise SSD business?","Mark Long","That\u2019s an easy question, I'll take it. The answer is none. So when we did SanDisk acquisition, we talked about is vertical integration opportunity and we actually decided especially when the markets went into a constrained position that extending out our relationship with Intel who gave us access to more bits and that has worked well for us and we\u2019ve got some product introductions are going well with Intel. So from a business standpoint, not having our own NAND in all of our enterprise SSD we having some but not all that actually yielding a better long-term economic outcome than that we replaced all the Intel products immediately.","Mike Cordano","Right and I'll just add to that certainly that it\u2019s a testament to the way that relationship is going, the quality of those products in the marketplace and what we think we can do it from also allowing us to focus our product R&D on other thing. So, there is a number of benefits in this choice that's advantaging us through calendar 2018.","Mark Long","Right, and the good news is as I indicated, we do still have the 20-20 target for the SanDisk transaction that will include significant benefits from vertical integration, so intersecting with our own product line that has our own name by that time period.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","Just looking at the hard disk drive side, I saw you guys mention in starting the ramp of 12 and 14 terabyte drives. As you get small now just wondering what the mix would be as we exit 2018 with 12 and 14 terabyte?","Mike Cordano","Yes, we would expect as we exit calendar 2018 on the high cap range, it will be majority of our mix, but I did mention 12 and 14 together. And -- but I did mention what we do expect is this more diverse market as we pursue continued growth. So we will see a continued and steady mix up at the highest end of our portfolio but given different used cases and workloads, both technologically but also geographically we do think we\u2019ll see a longer tail of shipments at the lower capacities, as we referenced in this announcement of these mid range product that we announced for a week or so ago.","Vijay Rakesh","On the demand side, I saw BiCS3, I assume that 64-layer was almost 70% plus shipments now. So, as we go through 2018, what are the puts and takes on the NAND gross margin? Where can you drive cost down, I guess 96-layer is more later in the year, but just wondering as you go through the year where the puts and takes in the gross NAND margins?","Mike Cordano","Well, so two things. One is continued yield and productivity on the existing ramps that is on throughput which is ongoing on that\u2019s a big statement and then of course as we move to the new node in the second half of the year that gives us additional opportunity.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. Thanks.","Steve Milligan","All right, so I want to thank everybody for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."]}}
