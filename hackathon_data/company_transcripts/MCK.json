Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead","Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Audra. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related and intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments.","We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing our second quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports.","Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Before I recap our quarter, I want to take a few moments to discuss the issue that must be on everyone's mind: the announcement of Walgreen's acquisition of Rite Aid. We have a very strong relationship with Rite Aid. For many years we've provided distribution services for their brand pharmaceutical volume. When we expanded the relationship last year, Rite Aid was attracted to closer ties to McKesson because of our generic purchasing scale and our sourcing expertise, our leading industry distribution capabilities, including our ability to provide better levels of service to Rite Aid stores and the significant working capital and cash flow benefits available through this closer relationship. Since that time, McKesson has added significant additional scale to our Generics program.","Customers want a deeper relationship with McKesson, not only because of the competitiveness of our offering but also because we've built a broad array of customer-centric programs that deliver real value well beyond core distribution. In addition to our relationship with Rite Aid we've also had a strong business relationship with the management team at Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have great respect for what they've accomplished.","There's no doubt our industry is going through a period of dynamic change. I've been CEO of this company for 15 years and in healthcare my entire career. I've seen this industry go through transformative change on a number of occasions. I believe one of the fundamental strengths of McKesson has been our ability to constantly adapt and lead during times of change by staying focused on our customers and our true core values. McKesson leaders are the best in the business and we've demonstrated our ability to innovate and to drive consistent and steady growth over many, many years. And I believe we remain exceptionally well positioned across all of our businesses as we look to the future.","Now turning to our financial results, for the second quarter we achieved total company revenues of $48.8 billion, up 14%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, up 20%, both on a constant currency basis. In a moment I'll provide highlights of what was another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. But before I do, I will mention a few items that are important to understand with respect to our second quarter results. During the second quarter, we completed the sale of ZEE Medical, a business that was within our McKesson Medical-Surgical business and recorded a gain of $0.14 per diluted share.","And we recorded a $25 million favorable tax item in the second quarter as a result of a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling. This drove a benefit of approximately $0.11 per diluted share in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our second quarter results were better than our expectations, primarily driven by the timing of brand price inflation, which occurred earlier in the year than we had anticipated. As well as some favorable timing in our Technology Solutions segment. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of our business in the second quarter.","Coming back to the broader industry environment, pharmaceutical pricing trends have become the frequent subject of news headlines as we get deeper into this presidential election cycle. The observation I would make is that this pharmaceutical pricing discussions tend to ebb and flow over time. However, what remains clear is that pharmaceuticals are still the most effective and affordable way to treat patients. And innovation and drug development and the trend toward higher levels of generic penetration continue to deliver real value and cost savings through the healthcare industry.","The desire to tie payments to value and expand medication adherence in a world of fee for value is tremendous. And the issues of quality, access, and cost remain at the center of improving healthcare delivery. And McKesson is extremely well positioned to help our customers not only compete but thrive as they look to the future.","Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $48 billion, up 14%, and adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 11%, both on a constant currency basis. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, all turned in impressive results with a combined revenue growth of 17% in constant currency.","Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business was ahead of our expectations in the second quarter driven by continued strong growth, primarily from our largest customers, and the timing of certain brand price increases which occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we had previously anticipated. During the second quarter, we were excited to announce our expanded relationship with Albertsons. As you know, we signed a new five-year agreement that includes the sourcing and distribution of both brand and generic pharmaceuticals to Albertsons' network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S.","I'm also pleased to report that we've signed an agreement with CVS Health to retain Omnicare's long-term care and Specialty distribution business. We are proud of the exceptional value and service we provide to both CVS Health and Omnicare, and the great relationship we have enjoyed with both companies over many, many years. We are privileged to continue to serve them going forward.","And I would note that Health Mart is now more than 4,200 members strong, an increase of over 300 stores in the first six months of this fiscal year. This is a tremendous result. And I'm confident in the strength and scale of our value proposition for our customers and our manufacturing partners. And I believe that we remain extremely well positioned.","Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We continue to deliver excellent revenue growth in our Specialty business driven by the strong performance across our community Oncology business, the strength in our multi-specialty categories, and the strength of our U.S. Oncology network practices. In the second quarter we saw the first biosimilar launch in the U.S., the biosimilar for Neupogen. We anticipated an increasing number of biosimilar launches in the years to come and we are confident that we are very well positioned given our multi-channel presence, particularly our strength in the community clinic setting and our comprehensive service offering to be a partner of choice for our customers and manufacturers.","And our Canadian business got another quarter of solid revenue growth driven by great performance in our core distribution business, and the expansion of our independent pharmacy banner business along with outstanding growth in our Canadian Specialty business compared to the prior year.","Turning now to our results in International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services. Revenues for the second quarter were $5.9 billion, up 2% year-over-year in constant currency. And Celesio's operating performance was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first half of fiscal 2016. We're excited about the acquisition of pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's which will add 281 pharmacies to our leading Lloyds pharmacy brand in the United Kingdom. And we also announced the acquisition of the pharmaceutical distribution business of the United Drug Group, which provides us a strong platform for growth in the Irish market.","These acquisitions complement the excellent position of Celesio businesses in the European market and further enhance McKesson's and Celesio's global value proposition to our customers and manufacturing partners. We remain encouraged by the steady improvement we are seeing in the operating results of Celesio as we continue to make important investments in modernizing the IT infrastructure of the business, which will provide a foundation for further operating improvements going forward.","And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenue of $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. I am really pleased with the growth we are driving across Medical-Surgical with a special focus on our Primary Care business which includes physician offices, clinics, surgery centers, and health systems. And although primary care was, as anticipated, the most complex part of the integration work, we've made tremendous progress with the PSS integration through the retention of our world class sales force, the alignment of our technology, and the optimization of our distribution network, all without missing a beat in serving our customers.","We also have done a terrific job of creating value with our McKesson brand products. I spend a fair amount of time speaking about global sourcing as it relates to our pharmaceutical business, but it's also important to highlight the global sourcing strength of McKesson in our Medical-Surgical business where we've built exceptional expertise and capabilities over the last decade. It's clear to me that we are emerging from the effort of the PSS integration not only as a more scaled business but also as a partner that can deliver best in class customer service and selection in this industry.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the second quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions' revenue to grow at mid-single digits compared to the prior year, which includes the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter. And we now expect that the full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up low-double digits compared to the prior year, reflecting the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract. This is partially offset by generic pharmaceutical pricing trends that we expect will remain weak in the second half of our fiscal year and similar to the level we experienced in our second quarter.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 6% for the second quarter to $721 million, driven primarily by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was approximately 22%, which was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions and relay connectivity business and favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. We expect to achieve a full-year adjusted operating margin for the segment at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our nurse triage business.","Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13 for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.14 compared to the guidance we provided in July. Our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items: a net gain of $0.11 for the full year in the sale of ZEE Medical; a revised full-year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter.","Now these positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at similar levels to what we experienced in our second quarter. And as you know, our prior guidance did not contemplate a change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with Omnicare and CVS Health and are updating our guidance to reflect this revised agreement.","For the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. The Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders from a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook for fiscal 2016 and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13. This revised outlook is driven by the following five items. First, a pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.14 per diluted share from the sale of the ZEE Medical business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. The benefit to our full-year adjusted earnings from this divestiture is $0.11, which is net of the $0.03 in adjusted operating profit that we no longer expect to earn from the ZEE business during fiscal 2016. Second, a discrete tax benefit of approximately $25 million related to a U.S. Tax Court ruling during the second quarter which allowed us to revisit a previous tax filing position. Third, the reduction in our expected weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2016 from repurchasing $500 million in common stock late in the second quarter. Our updated diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for the fiscal year is now 234 million. Fourth, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And fifth, the impact of certain customer contracting decisions since our previous earnings call in late July, including the expiration of our contract with Optum and our new relationship with CVS Omnicare.","Before reviewing our second quarter results, I would like to highlight an update to the schedule accompanying our earnings press release. We have expanded Schedule 3 to include supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. This supplemental information provides a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations. I hope you all find this to be a valuable addition to our ongoing disclosures given the now global nature of our business.","During the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.08 respectively year-over-year. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures which are provided in Schedule 3. Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.31, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, consolidated revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $48.8 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $50.2 billion, an increase of 14%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 1% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 4%, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 7% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, which was recorded in the Distribution Solutions operating expense line, total company operating expenses were up 1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $91 million decreased 4% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency.","Now moving to taxes, during the second quarter the previously discussed discrete tax benefit of $25 million drove a reduction in our adjusted tax rate to 29.1%. For the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%. As a reminder, our full-year adjusted tax rate reflects our expected mix of domestic and foreign income and anticipated discrete tax items. Adjusted income for the quarter was $776 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.31, up 19% on a reported basis and up 20% in constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, the year-over-year currency headwind to Q2 adjusted earnings equated to approximately $0.03 per share.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares were flat year-over-year at 235 million. As mentioned earlier in the second quarter, we executed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $500 million which exhausted the previously granted board authorization. As a result, we now expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $234 million (sic) [234 million] for the fiscal year. And our board has recently approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion.","While we continue to plan for and repay significant debt maturities in fiscal 2016, our recently announced acquisitions, increased dividend, executed share repurchase, and new share repurchase authorization are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment which we have implemented for several years. Now let's turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B","Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $48 billion were up 11% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $49.4 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of 14%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $40.6 billion in the second quarter, up 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Demand, primarily from our largest customers, which includes a growing mix of Specialty pharmaceuticals, drove strong revenue growth but also a corresponding impact on our margin profile during the quarter.","In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we continue to expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues to increase by a low double digit percentage. However, it is important to note that this revenue forecast now includes expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third fiscal quarter. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.9 billion for the second quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $1 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.","Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.8 billion in the second quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by market growth. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by market growth offset by the sale of ZEE Medical. For the full year, we now expect medical surgical revenues to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage versus the prior year as a result of the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.6 billion decreased 1% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a constant currency basis to $2.7 billion. Adjusted gross profit was impacted by growth in demand from our largest customers and weaker generic pricing trends compared to the prior year, offset by the timing benefit of certain brand price increases. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 8% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense decreased 1% year-over-year. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.","Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 239 basis points, a decline of 5 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 7 basis points. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, the segment adjusted operating margin decreased 17 basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year.","The decline in year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin was driven by our business mix and weaker than expected generic pricing trends relative to the prior year, offset by the favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we do expect some variability in the impact of branded pharmaceutical prices from quarter to quarter.","Based on the net gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract at the start of the third quarter, offset by our business mix and weaker pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to expand by low double-digit basis points versus the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $721 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our Nurse Triage business in the first quarter and anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts. Second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 13% to $157 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 22% representing an increase of 373 basis points versus the prior year.","On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 9%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 281 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity businesses, along with the benefit of favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. For the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our Nurse Triage business.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by one day to 31 days. Our day sales in payables increased by five days to 53 days. We generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $274 million for the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares totaling $500 million while repaying approximately $500 million in long-term debt.","Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our previous range of $12.36 to $12.86 to a new range of $12.50 to $13, an increase of $0.14. As John mentioned in his remarks, our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items: A net gain of $0.11 for the full year on the sale of our ZEE Medical business; a revised full year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter.","These positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year, but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And as John just mentioned, our prior guidance did not contemplate the change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with CVS Omnicare, and our updated guidance reflects our revised agreement. Our outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance.","In addition, we now expect $1.25 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.33 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.89 and $0.99 per share in LIFO related adjustments.","In summary, McKesson delivered solid financial results during the first half of fiscal 2016, and we are confident in our outlook for the fiscal year.","Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Audra?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. . We'll go first to Lisa Gill at JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, John for all the detail. I was wondering maybe if we could just start with Europe and Celesio. The last two acquisitions you've made have been in Europe. Can you maybe just give us an update on how you view the European market? What are some of the opportunities? And, you know, how has it played out over the last year and a half versus your expectations when you bought Celesio?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Clearly we went into Europe with our eyes wide open on two fundamental things. One was that Celesio wasn't operating at the level we thought it could and should, and certainly under McKesson's ownership. And second was that the European market does have some risk related to the demand profile as well as the regulations and reimbursement structures that exist there. Having said all of that and knowing where we are headed, we're really pleased with the quality of the results thus far.","We believe there's significant opportunities for us to grow both organically in that business by penetrating the areas of the market that have yet to be touched by wholesale distribution, and certainly not touched by us. Like Specialty or Oncology or Hospital distribution. And clearly we think there's a great opportunity for us to deploy capital effectively, efficiently, and appropriately in Europe to help build our value proposition in that market.","And also, as you know, we brought with us a very large retail footprint which grows through the acquisition of Sainsbury's and it is growing also just organically in Europe as we complete our banner rollouts with our European pharmacy network, et cetera. So all said, I think we feel like we're in really good shape. We have a couple more years of building out our technology capabilities there. We're in the midst of installing SAP and we have some other work to do, but we do believe that we'll get into business position to not only invest in it the way we have started to, but also to get organic growth.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, does the company have a goal for how much of operating profit or revenue of the company will come from outside of North America, say over the next several years? And I know I'm not allowed three questions, but I just need a clarification on the comments out of Celesio that you cleared the transfer agreement. Does that mean that you're de-listing the stock? And then I'll stop there.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly on the first part of that question, Lisa, we do have an expectation to grow in all of our businesses, and to grow at rates that are at or above market levels, particularly in markets where we are under-penetrated and there's significant opportunity for us. And that would be the case in Europe. We think there's significant growth prospects for us in most of the markets in which we compete. And as I mentioned, I think this idea of continuing to bring a banner Health Mart-like approach to Europe has been successful and is continuing to show great promise. So you'll see us roll out more Lloyds or Lloyds-like pharmacies throughout Europe. And James, perhaps you can talk a little bit about the...","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. In terms of the Celesio stock, when we gained operating control of Celesio, Celesio was trading on five German exchanges, and we have since then de-listed from three of the five. And on the remaining two, we're still a part of the regulated unofficial market. Those markets are Munich and Dusseldorf. I can't comment on any future plans around de-listing. There are a variety of German legal requirements for us to adhere to, but that's an update on our progress.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll move next to Steven Valiquette at UBS Financial.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thanks. Good morning, John and James. Congrats on the results. So I guess, John, in your prepared comments, you reinforced the notion that there's a lot of change going on in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply channel marketplace. And I guess in light of that, do you think we've reached an era now in the U.S. where large drug distributors could potentially own and operate fairly large retail drug chains in the U.S., similar to what McKesson and others are already doing in Europe? Is this something that you think you could consider now, just given all the U.S. alliances that have already been formed?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Steven, for the question. And obviously in Europe the construct of the industry is a little bit different in several of the markets where the wholesalers and retailers are part of the same organization. And in most of those cases, it's the same for all the industry participants, that they are both in the retail business as well as in the wholesaling business. We've looked at that phenomenon for a long time in Europe and wondered if it made sense in a U.S. context. I can tell you that we continue to believe that our customers appreciate the fact that we bring to them a focus on their success and that focus is not hampered by our own interest in a business similar to theirs or competing with them. And so I think that there's still, at least at McKesson, a focus on not competing with our customers in these segments and helping them be more successful each and every day.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Can I sneak in just a quick one on the Omnicare? Just for the generic, I'm guessing the sourcing will probably go through Red Oak, but are you saying that you'll still do just the physical distribution of the generics for Omnicare? Or is your distribution retention just on the brand side? Just want to clarify that piece. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you might recall that when we started the relationship with Omnicare many years ago, they relied on us for their brand distribution and purchased their generics directly themselves and put it into their own warehousing infrastructure. With our more recent agreement that we worked through with them, you know, we took on the rest of that responsibility, which I think was extremely beneficial to Omnicare. The new structure of the ongoing relationship with CVS will take us back in the direction where our original agreement was with Omnicare, principally focused on the brand side. Now having said that, almost with all of our customers, there is some generic business that we do, principally when there's a shortfall from a centralized warehouse approach or a direct approach. But we'll go back to more of our old relationship. And we're really pleased to be able to do that and to continue to service these Omnicare sites.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser at Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning, and congratulations for the Omnicare contract. Two questions here. The first of all, is there an impact of the deals \u2013 you're going back to kind of like the old Omnicare generics, some uncertainty around other deals. Does losing kind of like generic business from these kind of like assets that now have been acquired has any impact on your generic purchasing power as it relates for the rest of your business?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ricky, for the question. Clearly we have had a long run of building significant scale in generic sourcing. And what's interesting about the model that we've built is our customers are choosing to rely on our ability to continue to grow scale and to negotiate favorable agreements and then use us and our assets and our service delivery model to fulfill their needs. We continue to grow our presence quite significantly from a sourcing perspective. You heard me mention a little bit about it when I talked to our continued growth in Health Mart and our new arrangement with Albertsons. And we have over 20,000 pharmacies now that are principally buying all of their generics from McKesson. And so that bulk of business is quite significant and quite attractive to get access to our channel by the generic manufacturers. So, one could argue whether we're number one, number two, number three at any one point in time in any specific market in terms of our generic sourcing. But I believe we have significant scale and are retaining and growing that scale in a way that will be attractive and will bring manufacturers to us in a positive, collaborative way where we can get real value for our customers and for the manufacturers","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the follow-up is around the branded side. I mean, in the prepared remark obviously you talked about the fact that your assumptions regarding branding inflation are unchanged. There is some uncertainty in the marketplace around inflation, especially given the election debate that's shaping out. How should we think about McKesson's exposure to branded inflation overall and especially when we think about the March quarter, right, being usually a quarter with more inflation than the rest of the year?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, in our prepared comments we talked about the fact that we believe the first half of the year was slightly stronger from a branded inflation perspective. But for the full year, we expected it to be in line with our expectations. And that is still our point of view. Now, clearly there is more media attention and there is more discussion about price inflation in the market. But I happen to believe that the manufacturers that we work with at least will largely retain their current strategy. And there may be some outliers that begin to change their perspective slightly, but overall I think we expect the trends to continue.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. John, I actually just wanted to go back to the comments around Europe and Celesio specifically. I know in the prepared remarks you said Celesio has been exceeding your operational expectations, but I'm curious if you could give us an update on the synergy progression there, maybe relative to some of the targets you guys had shared previously. And I guess specifically, just how the generic purchasing benefits are going and if they're flowing through the combined entity today.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've made very good progress. As you know, we established our global sourcing and procurement operations in London, and we have suggested to you in the past that the synergies of $2.75 to $3.25 would be more first half-loaded over a four-year period. So we are in that cycle now and I think we're making very good progress and are on track to accomplish our objectives. So once again, I think the manufacturing community has responded favorably to our global footprint and believe being a strong partner with McKesson will help them grow their business. And that's really the value proposition that we're putting forth and are delivering is that it's a win-win for people that are working closely with us in this collaborative way. So making good progress.","And the comments I made earlier about Celesio was more on an operating perspective, that we're beginning to stabilize the operations of the business, put the systems in place and the culture in place along with building on the great management team that is already present. In fact, I was recently both in Italy and in the UK meeting with the management teams there, and there's some exciting things going on and I think the team is really energized about the opportunity of being part of McKesson in the first instance, but also the fact that investment is flowing both in terms of internal investment in warehouses and strategy and in IT systems and infrastructure but also in terms of bringing acquisitions to the table that make sense to grow our business and to grow our platform. So I think that the perspective is quite positive.","Now, having said all of that, it's a while before this thing is going to grow the way you know we can grow it. It just takes us some time to put the foundation in place.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. I appreciate all that. And then I guess just one more specific one, James. If I go back to the change in guidance, if I maybe exclude the ZEE Medical and the tax benefit, trying to just get my head around the $0.11 reduction. It looks like buybacks added maybe around $0.10. Could you maybe just walk through the other moving pieces, specifically around the contract decisions you mentioned and then the change in generic inflation assumptions?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, well, as we laid out a little bit during the prepared remarks, we have the ZEE gain for $0.11, the updates to our full year tax drives around $0.06, the share repurchase, the $500 million activity that we went into in Q2 drives around $0.09. So when you offset that against the loss of the Optum contract, and we've also talked about the fact that our guide now for the full year includes the new relationship with CVS Omnicare and our expectations for generic price increases, that really fills out the various drivers.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, I'm sorry. Just a clarification then. So did the generic assumption change, and that's part of the change in guidance?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, what's important to remember is when we were last talking to you and talking about the guide, we did not have any change for the back half of the year to how we had been thinking about generic pricing right at the start of the year. So what we're doing now is updating the back half of the year from a generic pricing perspective, and we're saying that you would see a similar level of weakness there in line to what we saw in Q2.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Willoughby of Bank of America.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Just a quick one. You'd mentioned in an earlier call that some of the assets in Brazil for Celesio were for sale. Is there an update on that?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're right. We did mention that. And the business has been I think working with potential buyers to portray the high quality assets that we have there, and I think we're still in a process with several interested parties. So I'm hopeful that we'll get that concluded within this fiscal year, if not in the third quarter. So we're making progress and we'll keep you updated as that goes. But yes, that is exactly what we said and we plan to continue with that plan.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Is there any way to size that, John? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is there a gain or a loss associated with it? Do you expect to associate with it?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, all I'd say is remember that this is part of our discontinued operations now.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Right.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it wouldn't impact \u2013 the end result won't impact our adjusted EPS.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I would say that it's on the small side as bread boxes go. I wouldn't fret about it too much.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Garen Sarafian at Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Good morning, John. Good morning, James. First on Omnicare, I appreciate the further clarification you made earlier in the Q&A, but I'm curious around the dynamics leading to this result. I would have thought that from a client perspective, all else equal, they'd want to keep both sides of the distribution with a single vendor. And from the distributor side, I thought that branded alone was fairly standardized low margin offering and pretty much a commodity. So I'm just wondering if there's anything unique that you were able to provide or any other unique dynamic that you can offer to help think through this.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's difficult for me to make blanket statements about what every customer chooses to do. I would say that our current relationship with CVS on the retail side of their business is principally the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals, and their strategy around generics is actually to ship those products directly from their own CVS warehouses and not to order them through distribution. So albeit I can't speak necessarily to what they ultimately will do with all of the Omnicare business, but usually the decision that large customers make is either to put all the generics and all of the brand into the single wholesaler that they've selected to partner with, at least for that store or that business line. Or to bifurcate the two of them and purchase the generics on a direct basis, put them into their own warehouse, manage their own logistics, and ship them to the stores.","You might recall when we had the discussion related to Rite Aid last year when they made a decision to get out of the generic business. What they were doing was not moving Rite Aid's generic volume from another wholesaler to McKesson. They were actually moving their generic volume out of their own infrastructure and into McKesson's infrastructure. So I would say that my belief is that CVS is still a self-warehousing customer on generics, and I would imagine that at least there's a strong possibility that what they'll do is move the Omnicare model back to the model that's frequently used within the rest of CVS. So I don't believe there'll be two distributors at Omnicare. I think there'll be a McKesson relationship on brand and perhaps some generic fill-in, and the rest of it will come out of CVS on a centralized, coordinated basis like they do for the rest of their operation.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just moving to Tech Solutions. Your margins were clearly strong leading to the revision to the high end of guidance. But in the prepared remarks, out of the three reasons behind the strength, two of the three were arguably sustainable. So could you just elaborate on how you're thinking about the margin profile of this segment moving forward? I'm just trying to get an idea of why this wouldn't continue its trajectory, at least on the margin front.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, what we have said in the prepared remarks is that we would expect the full-year guide for Technology Solutions' operating margin to be at the upper end of the high teens. So recall that when we gave you original guidance at the start of the fiscal year, we were expecting to be around the low end of the high teens. Now, the primary delta there is the care management gain that we recorded in the first quarter. Now, peeling back from that, we continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in our payer provider businesses and the relay connectivity businesses. But of course the growth there is having to be offset by our decision to exit the Horizon Hospital software business. So that will have an impact on technology solutions.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But obviously to reinforce what you're saying, we're pleased with the margin trajectory of that business and we're pleased with the progress we've made in taking as much cost out as we can as we take that Horizon business down over the next couple of years.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Coldwell at Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks very much. John, I think I generally agree with your views on branded inflation and clearly brand inflation is not as important as it was more than a decade ago under the old industry structure. But I would love it if you could give us a little more detail on sort of the current state of contracts, maybe the percent of sales that are not under fee for service relationships. And then under fee for service, suspending disbelief, if branded price inflation did pare back, what would happen with the model? How would you adjust? What kind of impact might we see? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question. Clearly as you mentioned, if you go back in history, there have been lots of different models that McKesson has used to create relationships with manufacturers that are beneficial to them and beneficial to ourselves and certainly onward to our customers. And over time we have created relationships with the manufacturers that have been less dependent on price inflation, providing more visibility to the manufacturers on our supply chain and working in partnership with them to give them the data and the things that they might find useful to them in their own production activities and their go-to-market strategies. And in return, they've gone and paid us for that work in these fee for service or distribution relationships contracts that they've have signed.","That has frankly taken some of the top off the opportunity on price inflation and taken some of the bottom off on price inflation risk, so the band of performance is probably certainly a little more forecastable. And we've also talked in the past that roughly 80% plus or minus of our business are in structured arrangements that are fee for service type of dialogue or certainly more constructed and documented than the rest of the balance. So that also has helped reduce some of the volatility you might find in this particular lever of profitability inside of our P&L.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","With the \u2013 you talk about the 80%, and I think that is a pretty consistent message. Is the 20% \u2013 is a certain percentage of that your Specialty business, or are you talking core traditional brand at retail when you give the 80% figure?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's really sort of across the board. And I think another response I could give to you and your associates, when you think about inflation risk for McKesson, there are lots of levers we use in our business to drive our performance. And when we try to give you these high level themes, it's because they are important themes, and we talk about them at the annual guidance point. We give you our assumptions because they are drivers of our value. But clearly as you go through the year, there are a lot of things that aren't quite as you expected at the beginning of the year, and if they're part of these larger forces, we'll update you as the year goes on. And James spent some time talking about generic inflation and its relative position against our expectations when we started the year.","But there are also lots of other drivers in our business that are going both positive and in negative throughout the year, and I can assure you that the company remains extremely focused on driving our performance as we have over the last 15 years, and we use these other vehicles to offset risk that might be apparent to us in our business as those risks materialize.","So, do we have risk on inflation? Clearly we talked about generics today, and we talked about our views of brand inflation. But it's also our responsibility to not only tell you about these things but manage these risks on a proactive basis and be assertive and on top of it. And if there was some fundamental sea change in our industry relative to our views of where these metrics might go over time, then we would begin to reformat our relationship with our customers and our supplier partners and we'd find ways to continue to grow our business. And so I think that that level of confidence is what you should be getting from us today.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go in next to George Hill at Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. John, appreciate all the comments around kind of the Rite Aid announcement. I guess, but the company seems a little bit snake-bit by industry M&A lately. I guess either John or James, can you guys quantify the risk around the Rite Aid relationship? And John, I would ask as you think about industry consolidation strategically, do you feel like the company needs to be more aggressive than it has been historically and does it change the risk profile at all for how you think about acquisitions?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question here. Clearly we've had a longstanding relationship with Rite Aid and we'll do everything we can to help them in this transition. And we have a great deal of respect for Mr. Pessina and his team at Walgreens and the kind of value they've delivered over a long time. And we've been working with Walgreens for 20 years, and I know Stefano for over 18 years, having traveled back and forth to Europe before he got to the scale that they are today. And so, these working relationships usually help us as we work through transitions in our industry, and we're really proud of the fact that our longstanding relationship with CVS both on the mail side as well as the store side at least came into play when we had the dialogue regarding Omnicare.","So are we sometimes on the wrong end of these transactions? Absolutely. But as to the second part of your question, it doesn't mean we're going to deploy capital in a reckless way. We've got a long track record of building value through a portfolio approach and we'll continue to do that. We're not oblivious to the risk that exists as our market consolidates both on the supplier and the customer side. And clearly sometimes we're with the consolidators and sometimes we're not. And when we're not, we have to find a way to either create a relationship or build on an existing relationship or find another avenue to grow our business, which is our ultimate objective.","And we have chosen thus far, and we believe this is the right path, to not compete with our customers. So I don't think we'll begin acquiring providers in an effort to offset the risk of provider consolidation in our book of business to deal with it. What we'll continue to do is focus on the value we can deliver for our partners. And as that value creation opportunity expands, then hopefully even through acquisitions, people will find that McKesson is the partner of choice, and they'll build their relationship with us as opposed to discontinuing it. But you can tell also from our guidance that sometimes when these relationships change, it has a negative effect on our margin structure, and that's really what we're reflecting when we talked about some of the puts and takes in the quarter.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd just add that an example, a very recent example of where we're building with the consolidator is Albertsons Safeway. So it's a mix, a natural ebb and flow of the business cycle.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, and I guess maybe then just the quick follow-up would be does industry consolidation maybe from an M&A perspective think about how far just from the core that you look? And I guess how, when I think about McKesson's expertises, it's in procurement, it's in supply chain, it's in logistics, it's in distribution. Do you start to look into tangential spaces in healthcare or are there customer groups that you don't serve now where McKesson's expertise can be leveraged that you see opportunities? Thank you","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question. Clearly our job is to find ways to grow our business and to do it intelligently and to do it in a risk-bounded way and to deploy capital intelligently. So I think our number one priority is to deploy capital in places where we have a base and an expertise and where it's not a completely new leg of the stool, but it's something that's additive to what we're currently doing. So, I think we evaluate everything and clearly every healthcare or almost healthcare distribution opportunity that comes on the market comes through McKesson and many of them we pass on because it's not straight up our alley or we believe that the price is too high. But otherwise, we're going to stay pretty focused.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and I'd just add in terms of the breadth of our businesses, whether it's Canada, Europe, Specialty, Medical-Surgical, Technology Solutions, and there are a variety of businesses that we have where there will be opportunities that are down the middle of the fairway.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly. We've just been told there are a few more questions pending so we're going to run this call just a little bit later for those of you that have time to do that. So we'll go on to the next question.","Operator","And we'll move to Charles Rhyee at Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question here. John, James, John, I think in your remarks you talked about biosimilars with Neupogen being the first launch. Just curious what you've seen in terms of the uptake in that product and how that might be shaping your views on biosimilars in the future.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for the question. Clearly biosimilars are going to be an important aspect of our business portfolio going forward and we will continue to, I think, see benefit of these biosimilar launches over the coming years. As to the specific launch that we've recently seen, it frankly has not gotten a ton of traction yet, at least not in our business, and it's behaving much more like a branded product than it is a typical quick-to-substitute generic. At some point these biosimilars probably will be more substitutable because their clinical effectiveness and efficacy will have been proven in some fashion. And that's where we'll have more opportunities to make faster transfers of the product. And we think we're very well positioned, particularly when the product are right down the alley of community oncology and we can use our U.S. oncology network to help validate the efficacy of the product and then move market share very quickly, either keep the market share with the originator or move it to the biosimilar to the extent that they're replaceable. So we will look for opportunities going forward.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","If I could just follow up there, though, right now then would you say the margin profile also looks more like a brand than a generic? And then in terms of substitutability, though, it seems like in the biosimilar pathway that it doesn't have the same type of A-B substitutability that traditional generics do. Do you think that regulations have to change to allow that for distributors to really benefit from that ability to move share? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it is behaving more like a brand, and not only in terms of the way it's being taken to market and its pricing structure, but also in the way that the physicians are viewing it. I think they want to have a discussion about the product itself as opposed to accepting an automatic substitution by a pharmacy or by a wholesaler. I do believe, though, over time that substitutability question will become less and less a question and to the extent that we can help people create evidence that supports the A-B interchangeability or therapeutic substitution, then we certainly will pursue that. In the meantime, though, we look at that as a long-term priority, and I wouldn't consider any of the up and coming pending things in the next six months to a year as being blockbuster, big successes for us, at least right out of the gate","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Percher at Barclays.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I'd like to go back to one of your early comments, John, on consistency. And this may be a question more for James. But I look at the balance sheet and think this is a large lever for you to be able to drive consistency as we look out to the forward years. Particularly today, you mentioned $5.4 billion of cash and $1.7 billion of CFO to come. We saw the revolver put in place. As we look over the balance of the year, I know there was some debt maturity. We've got the international acquisitions. But it feels like there'll still be a pretty substantial capability. So could you walk us through what will be due and maybe what was behind the revolver and where you sit as you look at the remainder of the year?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we're certainly pleased with the financial flexibility that we have. And I'll start off just by really reminding you of the portfolio approach that we have to capital allocation. And within that portfolio, internal capital expenditures and M&A are the first and second priorities. So certainly want to be clear about that. But given the degree of flexibility that we have, obviously we're also going to look regularly at what we think is a realistic M&A pipeline in the short, medium term. Contrast that against our cash balance and our coming projected free cash flow and make an assessment as to whether there's excess cash available for share repurchases. And you've seen us take that action in terms of buybacks now both in this last Q2 and in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year.","So we're pleased that the board authorized the new $2 billion authorization for share repurchases. So it feels as though we have the liquidity and the right portfolio approach, the right flexibility, to continue to deploy capital effectively on your behalf.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And the change in, or the element that has impacted guidance was the $500 million being done earlier in the year. There's no change. The $2 billion issued is not implied to be used in your current guidance. And I guess it also begs the question when you look to Europe, are there $10 billion deals, or are most of these $2 billion, $3 billion, or much smaller?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of the weighted average shares outstanding, the full-year number that I mentioned was 234 million. Embedded within that is the $500 million buyback. There is nothing assumed about progress against the new $2 billion authorization. In terms of the transaction sizes available to us, I wouldn't want to really comment on anything specific to M&A. You've seen the recent deal sizes with UDG and Sainsbury's. But there's a wide range of opportunities across the very broad set of businesses that we operate.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Francis at RBC Capital Markets.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks, and congratulations on a solid quarter. Just a real quick one, John. Bigger picture, I appreciate the commentary on what you're seeing from pricing trend perspective across both the brand and generic baskets. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing volume-wise in terms of any meaningful change in the marketplace up or down domestically? Is there anything going on in the broad economy that's impacting volume trends as you're seeing them in the U.S. business? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Dave. I think we see things pretty much in line with what we had expected for the year on a volume basis. And clearly you can see that the numbers that are being posted by the various sources as to prescription volumes. I think we don't see any major changes. There are perhaps some changes that you might see in the physician office perspective, but I would say that the biggest change or trend that we continue to see is that some of our larger customers are growing more rapidly than the rest. And in particular, our largest mail customer has had pretty nice growth. And so that puts a little pressure on our margin structure, particularly on the Specialty products that go through that particular customer. But otherwise, everything's pretty much in line with what we'd anticipated.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very good. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Larsen at Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Can you talk about the generic inflation comp? Like, when do you expect that to start to ease? So inflation rates were obviously very high in calendar 2014. They've pulled in over the past couple of quarters. So next year, and just any general thoughts. Would you expect the comp for generic inflation to ease a bit?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, generic inflation is not forecastable and we certainly don't have any insight from what the manufacturers are planning to do in their businesses. We've updated our assumption for the back half of this fiscal year. And of course we really want to take a step back and emphasize how generic price inflation is just one of a number of variables that drive again this broad set of businesses. So I would urge not to have an over focus, if you will. It's an important issue, as John was mentioning earlier. We included in our initial annual guide, and we update you as the year goes along. But I really think we want to keep this in perspective in terms of the broad number of drivers of our businesses.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then just any quick thoughts on Target? Have you had any discussions with CVS around Target and that account?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, unless you've heard something different, we've not heard of the Target transaction closing, and I would imagine our conversations with CVS would be more worthwhile post that process than today. So I'm not really prepared to comment or speculate on it other than to say we're continue to service the Target business with all of our focus and we want to make sure those stores are in great shape pre the transition to CVS ownership.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Maybe just not to beat the horse on Rite Aid, but just going back, one of the big questions we've gotten from a lot of investors is just sort of understanding how change of control provisions work on these kind of contracts. Obviously you've dealt with quite a few of them recently. And I guess, secondarily, understanding the sort of pushes and pulls long-term of being a key provider to a large retail chain. Obviously you still have a relationship with CVS and we'll have to see what happens with Rite Aid. But that's on the mail side. How do you think about that? Does it help you at all with the independents? I'm just trying to understand the long-term implications of that as well.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, just to make sure that I'm clear, that \u2013 our CVS relationship is with both the mail as well as many of their retail stores and now our continued relationship on Omnicare. As to Walgreens and Rite Aid, we've had a long-term relationship with Walgreens. It just hasn't happened to have had distribution as a key component of it for perhaps a couple of decades. Like anything else we're going to work hard to make sure that those Rite Aid stores are serviced and continue to focus on making our customers successful there. And we'll see where things head over time.","But remember, customers kind of come and go in people's business, and albeit we've had a bad run here with two or three M&A transactions that were \"not our fault\" related to losing customers. But you also should expect that we'll continue to work hard to grow our business. And I talked before about the fact that we have a very large base of people who are dependent on us from a generic perspective. And albeit that base continues to grow. We think no matter what happens from a customer perspective, we will still be one of the largest suppliers of generics in the world and a very valuable partner to the manufacturers.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks. I'm sorry for the poorly worded question.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's okay. I just said I want to make sure everybody else listening was clear on it, Ross. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we'll take that from John Ransom at Raymond James.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John?","Operator","Mr. Ransom your line is open. Please go ahead.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Sorry. Trying to multi-task here and doing it very poorly. I'm sorry if this has been asked, but the Rite Aid contract expires in 2019. Is there a change of control out on the other side? Or do you expect that to remain in place through 2019?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we don't talk specifically about the terms of our agreements other than what we say at the beginning of them. And I think that the comment I made in answer to the question earlier is we plan to continue to serve their business with all of our effort and make sure that they're very successful as they continue through this transaction process.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. You're welcome.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I want to thank you, Audra. Thanks also for all of you on the call for your time today. Our industry experiences periods of dynamic change, and this is certainly one of them. And I'm confident that we will continue to participate in that change in an extremely positive way. We remain extremely well positioned to deliver the best service and value in the industry on behalf of our customers.","And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, John. On November 10 we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Conference in Scottsdale Arizona. And on January 12, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We'll release our third quarter earnings results in late January.","Thank you, and good-bye.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert. Please go ahead.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. ","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. ","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Think, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm really pleased to report the results from our last quarter of fiscal 2012, which wrapped up another strong full year of financial performance. ","Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.38, up 20% from the prior year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 10% to $31.7 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was up 17% to $2.09. We also had great performance in cash flow from operations, which came in at $2.9 billion for the year. This outstanding result is a tribute to our ability to efficiently manage working capital in a growing business. As a result of our cash flow performance and the overall strength of our balance sheet, in the fourth quarter we executed a $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to $1.9 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the independent banner and franchise business of Katz Group Canada for $919 million. After completing the Katz acquisition and executing the accelerated share repurchase program, we still ended fiscal 2012 with over $3 billion in cash on our balance sheet, leaving strong flexibility to deploy capital using our portfolio approach going forward. ","Turning to the broader industry environment. Health care topics remain a focus in this election year. We continue to believe the issues of quality, access and cost will remain at the center of all health care discussions. McKesson remains actively engaged in public policy conversations at the Federal and state level, addressing a number of issues that are important to our customers and, certainly, to our industry. ","The issues our customers face remain the same regardless of the outcome of the ongoing political and legal discussions on health reform. Health care providers, manufacturers and payers are looking for broad solutions to drive improved financial, clinical and operational performance. With the most comprehensive set of tools, services and resources in our industry, McKesson is well-positioned to support our customers as the industry continues to transform. ","Before I turn to the fourth quarter and full year results for Distribution Solutions, let me take a moment to walk you through a legal matter, which in the past has impacted our GAAP results in the Distribution Solutions segment. In our fiscal third quarter earnings call, Jeff indicated that we had reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice to resolve federal Medicaid claims related to AWP. I'm pleased to tell you that in April, we finalized this settlement, in line with our existing reserves. As you know, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. While there are still outstanding cases by public entities, which we plan to vigorously defend, this settlement with the Department of Justice represents another important step in bringing resolution to the claims related to AWP. ","Now moving on to some business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Strong execution in Distribution Solutions drove overall operating results for the company. We continue to grow and expand our value to our customers through our core capabilities of operational excellence, unmatched service levels, the global scale of our sourcing and the use of technology to help our customers succeed. U.S. Pharmaceutical continues to turn in outstanding results. Customers in all channels, from the small independent pharmacy to the large retail customer, recognize the value McKesson brings. As a result, we have succeeded along with our customers. ","We've also performed well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation in return. A significant accomplishment for the U.S. Pharmaceutical business was being selected as a sole distributor for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I'm extremely pleased the VA has again trusted McKesson with serving our nation's veterans. ","Finally, we had another significant quarter in generics, aided by 2 important product launches. Overall, generics continue to make a substantial contribution to our results. ","In summary, I believe U.S. Pharmaceutical is extremely well-positioned for continued industry leadership. ","Turning to our other businesses in Distribution Solutions segment. Our Canadian Distribution business had a solid year despite planned government-imposed price reductions for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces. Our team in Canada continues to find innovative ways to expand the breadth of their offering to our customers. And I'm pleased they were able to successfully mitigate much of the impact of ongoing regulatory challenges. We completed our acquisition of the independent banner and franchise business of the Katz Group Canada late in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Katz has been a valued customer of McKesson for over 20 years so these banner and franchise members, who primarily operate under the brands of I.D.A., Guardian and Medicine Shoppe Canada, have long-standing relationships with McKesson. The response from the pharmacists has been positive, demonstrating McKesson's support to independent pharmacy and our capability to develop innovative and value-enhancing programs. ","In our fourth quarter we recognized the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of US Oncology and our integration efforts are largely complete. US Oncology, part of McKesson's Specialty Health, provides one of the most comprehensive service offerings available to a large and fast growing segment in the health care industry. We have demonstrated the value of our expanded technology platform and broad sourcing capabilities that we bring to US Oncology physicians and hospitals. We remain focused on helping our customers succeed in an environment where they face increased reimbursement and competitive pressure. ","During the fourth quarter, I named Marc Owen as the new President of McKesson Specialty Health. Many of you know Marc and he's led our strategy and business development efforts since 2001. Marc has a deep understanding of the health care industry, including the dynamics of the specialty market. I believe his leadership, along with our physician customers, will continue to shape a successful strategy for this important business. ","Our Medical-Surgical business continues to contribute to the overall success of Distribution Solutions, with 8% growth in revenues in fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2012 results of our Medical-Surgical business extend a multi-year trend of strong execution and improved operating results. We continue our leadership in the ambulatory market by delivering value to our customers through our competitive offering, our strong focus on customer success and our private label products. ","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year performance in Distribution Solutions. As we look ahead to fiscal 2013, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will grow at the market rate adjusted for our mix of business. We also expect continued growth in Distribution Solutions operating margins. Jeff will discuss our operating margin assumptions in more detail, but I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our expected margin expansion. We expect continued strong relationships with our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners where we deliver a broad range of value-added services, resulting in steady compensation. In fiscal 2013, we expect brand price inflation will be at levels similar to fiscal 2012. We also expect good progress with our proprietary generics programs in our global sourcing initiatives. As you know, we approach generics as a single company across all of our customer segments in U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canadian Distribution, and our specialty businesses. We are headed into a year with a robust oral generics launch calendar, and we expect generic price trends to be similar to those we experienced in fiscal 2012. I have tremendous confidence in the success of the Distribution Solutions segment. We have an excellent team throughout this business, and they have constantly and consistently demonstrated over many, many years, a commitment to delivering a significant value to our customers and strong financial results. ","Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 4% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit was up 21% to $440 million, including a product alignment charge, which I'll come back to in a moment. So overall, I'm pleased with the continued progress we are making in the Technology Solutions segment. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we announced  a strategy in our hospital-facing business to converge core clinical and revenue cycle information technology solutions for the Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon's Microsoft platform over time. Since then, we've met with all Horizon Clinical customers to discuss what our product strategy means for them. Keep in mind, we're not forcing migrations. We expect to have customers on the Horizon Clinicals platform for many years to come. And to successfully partner with those customers as certification requirements evolve. We have a long history of product innovation, including enabling our technology products to address regulatory requirements faced by our customers. Many of our Horizon Clinical customers are live on the currently certified release or in the process of upgrading. Horizon Clinical customers have previewed the Paragon product, many of them have, and the development roadmap vision we put in place, and they're pleased with what we have seen. Several Horizon Clinical customers have elected to convert to the Paragon product, and we started some of those conversions today. And we also have won new customers for Paragon. Our customers are pleased with the product as being contemporary, fully functional and easy to use and integrated. ","In my own conversations with hospital customers, they agree our strategy is the right one going forward, despite the competitive noise in the marketplace. We believe our strategy puts customers in a better position to reach the clinical and financial end points they will need as reform and payment models evolve. The electronic medical record is an important building block of a provider's overall technology strategy. But it is other components, like performance management, analytics, care coordination and payor capabilities that will create the difference in our customers' ultimate success. ","McKesson is the only company that delivers the breadth and depth of solutions to help our customers maximize the value of their core systems and improve quality and financial performance. Beyond our hospital-facing business, McKesson also continues to invest in solutions for our payer, pharmacy and physician customers. ","Our RelayHealth business sits at the center of addressing customers' needs to better connect and coordinate care. RelayHealth customers can send electronic prescriptions, clinical reminder messages, electronic lab results and care summaries to patients. The proposed rules for Stage II Meaningful Use place an increasing emphasis on connectivity. RelayHealth's tools are already well-positioned to help providers and payers across the spectrum achieve these requirements, regardless of their underlying technology platform. ","RelayHealth also helps facilitate the connectivity necessary for providers who are implementing new quality base care models. For example, the United States Department of Defense has implemented Relay Clinical secure messaging throughout its medical treatment facilities in all 3 branches of the military. This system allows health care providers to communicate with patients and other providers. McKesson Health Solutions is a leader in enabling players to use evidence-based clinical information technology to achieve better health care outcomes at lower cost. ","I'll take a moment to highlight 2 products that directly support the payer, and their provider partnerships, that are so important in today's market. McKesson Health Solutions has paired InterQual, the leader in clinical decision-support criteria with Clear Coverage, a next-generation point of care decision-support tool. InterQual is used by over 70% of the top 25 health plans and over 2\/3 of the hospitals in the United States. Together, these products are helping to promote consistent clinical decision-making that improves the efficient delivery of quality patient care. ","Overall, I'm pleased to see the level of collaboration among our technology businesses to help our customers as they achieve better financial and clinical outcomes. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, we expect Technology Solutions revenue growth should be at the approximate level of growth experienced in fiscal 2012. And in summary, we are committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to enable better business, better care and better connectivity. ","Before I end, I will spend a moment talking about capital deployment. Over time, we used our portfolio approach to capital -- for capital deployment for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investments, creating significant value for our shareholders. We are in businesses that continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We plan to continue our portfolio approach as we head into fiscal 2013. Our board recently authorized the repurchase of up to additional $700 million of our common stock, which brings the total remaining authorization to $1 billion. This action demonstrates our confidence in the business, and the stability of our future cash flows. ","To wrap up my comments, I'm pleased with our financial results in fiscal 2012. I'm confident in our team's ability to deliver strong performance in fiscal 2013. We have a steady track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth, and I'm pleased to provide fiscal 2013 guidance where we expect to continue that trend. We expect fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.05 to $7.35. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson delivered another year of outstanding financial results. We had good growth in both segments, and our tremendous cash flows allowed us to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment. This sets us up nicely for fiscal 2013, where we are pleased again to provide double-digit growth adjusted earnings per share guidance. ","In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. As you know, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to both the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent in some of our businesses. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus today more on the annual numbers than the quarterly ones, and I'll also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2013. My comments today will also focus on our full year FY '12 adjusted EPS of $6.38, which as you recall, excludes 3 items: acquisition-related expenses; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will all be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release. ","One other quick reminder. We fully lapped the US Oncology acquisition as of the end of the third quarter. ","Let me now begin with our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B. For the full year, consolidated revenues increased 10% to $123 billion versus $112 billion a year ago. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, total revenues increased approximately 7% for the full year, with both segments contributing nicely to this result. Total gross profit was up 10% for the year on the 10% increase in overall revenues. Although we did see a little bit of gross margin improvement in both segments. Total operating expenses for the full year were up 8% to $4.1 billion. Our full year operating expenses were higher primarily due to the US Oncology acquisition. As an aside, excluding the impact of US Oncology, full year operating expenses were up roughly 4% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. ","Moving down the P&L. Other income was fairly flat for the full year at $21 million. Full year interest expense increased $54 million to $251 million primarily due to the debt we've put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. ","Turning now to taxes. As of the end of the third quarter, our full year estimate of the tax rate was 32%. In the fourth quarter, however, we recognized some favorable tax discrete items, which drove our full year tax rate down to 30%. Looking forward, our fiscal 2013 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of 31%, which creates a modest headwind for next year. ","Net income for the full year was $1.6 billion and our earnings per diluted share was $6.38. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our full-year diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 5% year-over-year to $251 million. We were pleased that our board recently increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. While we don't comment on the timing or amount of future share repurchases, we do give guidance on our weighted average diluted shares outstanding assumption, which for fiscal 2013 is 239 million. ","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues increased 10% for the full year and also 10% for the quarter. Direct distribution and services and sales to customers' warehouses revenues were both up 10% for the year. Full year direct revenues reflect the favorable impact of market growth and the US Oncology acquisition. Warehouse revenues, as we have discussed over the past several quarters, increased primarily due to a new customer. To focus for a second on just the fourth quarter results, we did see particularly strong revenues in both the direct and warehouse lines, primarily due to an increase in volume with several of our largest existing customers. ","Looking ahead, given the record number of expected generic launches in our fiscal 2013, we anticipate direct revenues will be fairly flat and possibly even down a bit next fiscal year. Since our economics are better on generic drugs, this is, of course, a good thing for our customers and the company. ","Shifting to warehouse revenues in fiscal 2013, we do expect unusually strong double-digit growth in our warehouse line, primarily due to expanded volumes with existing customers. I would remind you, of course, that the impact on our earnings of higher warehouse revenues is quite modest, as we earn lower margin on our warehouse revenues relative to the margin on our direct revenues. ","Moving back now to fiscal 2012. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% for the full year and 13% for the quarter. Both the full year and quarter benefited from having 5 extra sales days in the quarter. When you exclude these 5 days, Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis were up 1% for the full year. Given the ongoing generic price reduction challenges we face, we're fairly pleased with the 1% full year growth and expect similar flat to low levels of growth in fiscal 2013. ","Medical-Surgical revenues were up 8% for both the full year and the quarter, primarily driven by market growth and new customers. Gross profit for the segment increased 11% for the full year. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, gross profit would be up approximately 5% for the full year. Distribution Solutions operating expense increased 9% for the full year, primarily due to the US Oncology acquisition. Once we've finished lapping the US Oncology acquisition, you saw our fourth quarter operating expense increase just 3% versus the prior year. For the full year, operating profit grew 13% to $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with an operating margin rate of 210 basis points. This is up 6 basis points year-over-year, and reflects a nice, steady, upward movement within our 200 to 250 basis point target range. ","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 4% for the full year to $3.3 billion, and full year operating profit was up 21% to $440 million. And as noted on Schedule 3B, our full year operating margin rate was 13.29%. Focusing on just the fourth quarter, you did see our revenues down 2% to $860 million and operating profit was down 20% for the quarter. I'd remind you that in fiscal 2011, our financial results were heavily skewed towards the March quarter due to several product GAs and certifications that occurred in last year's fourth quarter. This created some lapping challenges in our Technology segment in the March quarter, compared to the same March quarter in fiscal 2011. ","Operating expenses in this segment increased 3% for the full year, and we're pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth. Despite this focus on controlling costs, as another example of our commitment to our customer success, we continue to invest across all our technology businesses. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the year was $451 million, up 3% compared to $436 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 8% compared to 12% a year ago. ","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. We were pleased to see our cash flow from operations come in at $2.9 billion for the year. This is an outstanding result, and well above our original expectations. I view it as a great commentary on the businesses we are in and on the efforts of our management teams to continually find ways to more efficiently manage the business. For us as a company to grow our revenues 10%, adjusted earnings per share 20% and yet reduce our working capital by almost $0.5 billion is an outstanding result. This is reflected in our working capital metrics where our days sales outstanding decreased to 24 days from 25 days last year. Our days sales in inventory decreased by one day to 30 days, while our days sales in payables increased 2 days from a year ago, to 49 days. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in fiscal 2013. ","Overall, our gross debt to capital ratio was 36.8% at year end, leaving us right in the middle of our target range. Internal capital spending was $403 million for the year, slightly below our original expectations. You will see our fiscal 2013 guidance assumes an internal capital spending range between $425 million and $475 million. ","Moving now to provide some additional context for our fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings guidance of $7.05 to $7.35 per diluted share. John has already talked about our key -- he's already talked about our key business objectives and in our press release today, you will find a list of key assumptions underlying this guidance. So I won't go over these again here, but I would like to add a few points of additional color. ","I mentioned earlier that our fiscal 2012 operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 210 basis points. We expect improvement to this operating margin in the mid to high single-digit basis points. In Technology Solutions, we expect to get margin expansion of our fiscal 2012 operating margin rate of 13.29%, though we expect to still be within the low end of our long-term operating margin goal range of mid-teens. ","Turning to the quarterly progression. We expect the fiscal 2013 Technology Solutions results to be heavily weighted towards the back half, similar to fiscal 2011 results. Key products GAs in the back half of fiscal 2013 are the primary drivers of this expected result, just as we had key product GAs in the back half of fiscal 2011. To speak more broadly about our quarterly earnings per share progression, as you know, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance due to the variability in the timing of certain items in our business. Over the course of a full year, these factors tend to even out. But within the year, they can create challenges when comparing year-over-year results on a quarterly basis. To remind you of a few of these factors, first, in Distribution Solutions, as we've talked about today, we anticipate a record number of oral generic launches in fiscal 2013. This unprecedented level of launches certainly has the potential to create some quarterly fluctuations, but it is important to think about this relative to all of the other factors that also influence our quarterly results. For example, also in Distribution Solutions, although our agreements with branded manufacturers provide a steady level of predictability for compensation, the structures of many agreements use price increases as the determinant of compensation timing, which we can't always foresee accurately quarter-to-quarter. In addition, in Technology Solutions, as I discussed earlier, the anticipated timing of various product releases and GAs next fiscal year will cause results in the segment to be back-half loaded. ","Last, as for all companies, tax is another area where we see quarterly fluctuations. While these adjustments may change our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, in fiscal 2012, for example, we ranged from 27% to 32%. We believe that our annual tax rate is a better overall measure of our tax expense. Just to remind you, as I said earlier, our estimated adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2013 is 31%. So with all that being said, sitting here today as we look at our plans, when measured as a percentage of our annual earnings per share, we would expect the first quarter to be roughly similar to our experience in the fiscal 2012 first quarter. And again this year, our earnings per share will be weighted towards the back-half, and the fourth quarter will be exceptionally strong. ","With respect to our recent acquisition of the Katz Group assets, we are expecting accretion of approximately $0.15 on an adjusted earnings basis for fiscal 2013, and this accretion will be spread fairly evenly across all 4 quarters. ","Now let me briefly mention one last item that will impact our first quarter fiscal 2013 GAAP results. When you read the 10-K, you will see a subsequent events footnote pointing out that earlier this month, in April, we completed a business combination in which we acquired the remaining interest in our corporate headquarters build. The way accounting rules in this area work, this creates a pretax acquisition-related gain of approximately $75 million. Similar to how we treat other one-time acquisition-related items, this transaction will be excluded from our adjusted earnings results. ","To conclude, our fourth quarter results wrapped up another year of strong double-digit adjusted earnings growth, and we've laid a good foundation as we head into fiscal 2013. Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, first one, just on the quarter to follow up on some of your comments and your remarks. You said that direct revenue growth, direct customer revenue growth was stronger due to the growth of some of your customers, can I assume that those were bigger customers that were probably a little bit of a lower margin?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, that's a fair assumption, Tom. It is -- there's been some moving parts in the industry that have caused some of our larger customers to grow a little more rapidly than otherwise, and I think that's what's reflected in those numbers.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the outlook. You guys mentioned some of the headwinds and tailwinds in quarterly ups and downs throughout the year. Can you just comment maybe at a high level, your thoughts on generics, and how that may affect the quarterly progression?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, as I said, Tom, while generics are an important driver for us in FY '13 given the unprecedented year in oral generics as we've also talked about of course, it's a down year for specialty generics. I'd really come back to the fact that there's other items that are just as big driving some quarterly volatility. So the guidance I gave at the end there for the effect on EPS by quarter, where in particular for the June quarter as a percentage of our total year's earnings, we'd expect it to look actually pretty similar to last year, and it will -- the results will again be back-half loaded, pretty similar to last year. So a lot of the differences in the oral generic launch calendar are getting offset by some of the other timing differences we see year-over-year.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jeff, just as we look at bulk versus direct store deliveries, can you just remind us of, on a relative magnitude, the difference in the margins between the 2? And as we think about that next year, do you expect these increases in volumes to continue with these customers, or is this more related to the Walgreens-Express scripts dispute?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, while the Walgreens-Express dispute certainly drove some traffic everywhere else in the industry and many of our customers benefited from that and therefore, us. The increase, Lisa, in the warehouse revenues is really driven by the small handful of customers for whom we do warehouse business. I'd remind you that we only do warehouse business as part of a broader surface -- service offering to these customers where we do lots of direct store delivery. The warehouse revenues themselves are at a very low margin, which we don't disclose, but are an important part of the broader service offering to these customers. When you look at 2013, because the increase is more importantly, driven by some of the new business that our customers have won, we would actually expect double-digit growth in the warehouse revenue line in 2013.","John H. Hammergren","And, Lisa, you might recall there's a large -- there was a large contract that changed hands between one of our competitor's customers and one of our customers. And as a result, our warehouse revenue for the next 3 quarters at a minimum will be growing nicely as a result. To Jeff's point though, it does come at a low margin, puts a little pressure on us from a mix perspective in terms of driving our margin rate up. But we did guide to a margin rate increase for the year, in basis points we talked about earlier. So even with that pressure I think we can still get good leverage in our business, and we're pleased that our customers are winning, and we get to reflect that through our revenue as well.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then John, just as a follow-up. VA -- obviously congratulations on keeping that contract, can you comment at all if anything has changed within the contractual relationship? Obviously that the pricing was public, but how should we think that -- about that in context to some of your other customers, number one. And number two, are there any new services that you'll be providing to VA that you didn't previously provide in this new contract?","John H. Hammergren","Well, as we said earlier we are really pleased that we were able to win that award, and renew that relationship, and we're very happy about that. The contract itself has some nuances associated with it, but I think it largely is similar to the contract we had before. As it relates to other customers though, this customer is unique in its approach and the contract reflects its uniqueness in terms of the way it buys and the way it behaves, and so we had an eight-year run understanding how the VA contract worked for us and clearly that gives -- gave us good insight as we put our proposal in and fortunately allowed us to win that award. We don't believe other customers have any confusion about the uniqueness of the VA, and so we're hopeful that we'll continue to move forward with them like we have in the past as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hey Jeff, can you make -- can you give us a comment, the accounts receivable up even with the IT business winding down a little bit on the software side, any comment there. And then secondarily, on the share base, I can't get to your fiscal '13 guidance without a much bigger buyback, so I'm wondering just what the ASR did for you in the fourth quarter. Would you have, maybe a balance sheet share base outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, let me walk backwards on those. You're correct that in March we did a $1.2 billion ASR, and while the ultimate final timing or average price will be determined over the next few months. In effect, an estimate based on the then market price of how many shares we will ultimately get comes out of the share count right away. So when you see our 10-K in another day or so, you'll see that the March 31 share count, or I guess the mid-April share count for the 10-K, was about 235 million shares, because it reflects a very large reduction. I think once you plug that in you'll get right to our weighted average sales assumption. On receivables, I guess, I'd come back to it. Remember, we had a lot of growth in sales, so from a pure DSO perspective, you actually see our DSOs declining year-over-year from 25 to 24. And as always, that's really just driven more by customer mix than anything else, because it's really our U.S. Pharma business, it's the only one that's big enough to have much of an impact on that AR line, and we're actually pleased with that progress.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But nothing from Katz, or nothing from aging on that front?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","No, the Katz transaction, while they did -- do appear in the balance sheet on March 31, there's no P&L results because we closed right at the end of March. The assets and liabilities they added are certainly not material at the AR line.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of question follow-up. I guess for the record, John, there's obviously another RFP up for bid, Express Scripts has announced they've issued the RFP. I would assume you would have an interest. Can you confirm that? And if so, if you do win that, how would you balance servicing that customer with your other larger mail-order customers?","John H. Hammergren","We are aware of the activity at Express Scripts. We typically don't talk about the activities of our existing customers, let alone the activities of other people's customers or potential customers. So I hesitate to comment on the Express Scripts opportunity other than to say that clearly, they're a large -- a large player in the industry now and will certainly command the interest of players in the industry, and I know that this will be sort of another mini VA question for people, but there's a time line to get it resolved. I think that from a service perspective, McKesson stands in a position where we are able to service customers and accomplish their requirements, both from a capacity perspective, but probably as important, in terms of the value we bring to our discussions with our customers, and that's what we try to focus the opportunity. Sometimes customers are open to those discussions and sometimes they're not. And clearly our team will have to reflect on that as they think about this opportunity going forward.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, another, I guess, a timely question for you, John, just the Chairman of the largest overseas pharmaceutical supply chain company quoted today suggesting a real need for them to expand or [ph] partner in the U.S. Can you remind us of how you're viewing your expansion in the global footprint, given you're the largest supply chain company in the world already, and what would be important factors in your mind of positives and negatives of potentially expanding the acquisition globally?","John H. Hammergren","Well I didn't see the quote, I can guess as to where it came from. The -- that same person probably also has a vertical opportunity in terms of retailing. So it's difficult to say necessarily where they may end up or go. Clearly, we have a North American footprint in Distribution today that we're very proud of, and we've performed very well in those markets. As it relates to international expansion, there are clearly some synergies that exist relative to product sourcing perhaps, and that may exist in terms of bringing best practices between various countries or markets, and we've done some of that clearly here between Canada, in particular, and the U.S. and we've taken a one McKesson approach into Canada, bringing other products and services there even outside of Distribution, because that footprint or platform gives us an opportunity to expand. And clearly that same argument could be made for other markets. That's the bull case for doing those kinds of things. The bear case, you'd have to think about growth rates in other markets. You have to think about the cost to buy into other markets or the greenfield in other markets and return on capital, and we are very focused on getting cash returns that are exceeding our cost of capital. We do think cash flow is very important, and we do think that you have to pay the right price or it doesn't matter how strategic a potential acquisition would be. And then so growth rates, what you have to pay, what synergies do you bring and then lastly, what are the characteristics of those markets. Are you -- as you've witnessed recently in other headlines, there are dangers in going off the American shores and participating in markets where business practices might be at minimum unfamiliar to us and at maximum, potentially hazardous to us. And I think that McKesson's very aware of those challenges and has to remain diligent and visual [ph] and remain focused on not poisoning ourselves through an acquisition that doesn't make sense in that characteristic. So we remain open, but albeit skeptical on some of this and we'll see how it plays out.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, very good. You got the person right, it was just a blub on the Financial Times, FYI.","Operator","We'll hear next from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, just wanted to go back to the favorable tax discrete items in the quarter, and I was just curious if you could maybe share with us when you might have had visibility to that benefit. If I look at the other side, the operating expense side, costs are a little bit ahead of our model in the quarter. Just curious if there was anything pulled forward, relative to that benefit that you might have known was coming.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, maybe to answer your question just slightly more broadly, Robert, there's really 3 things that drive our tax rate. One is the mix of business which didn't -- international versus U.S. didn't really surprise us and, frankly, it's pretty similar next year. Two is tax law is always changing, the R&E credit's going away, for example, again, which is one of the things driving our tax rate up a little bit next year. And third, they're always truing up to actual tax returns, settling -- small settlements with states and foreign governments, and sometimes those are positives and sometimes they're negative, and they're pretty hard to predict. So we had a couple of positives in the March quarter that we really didn't have that much visibility too, until the March quarter. While we knew the disputes were out there, you never really know when and exactly how you're going to settle them until you get there.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just, on my follow-up, slide in one on Technology Solutions. Sales and profit there, at least relative to our model were a little bit below expectations. Since making the decision around the Horizon suite of products, is there, I know you guys touched on this in your prepared remarks, but has there any meaningful customer pushback, and I guess how are you factoring in shifting clinical customers from Horizon to Paragon in the fiscal '13 guidance?","John H. Hammergren","Well, at a high-level, the customers that we've -- that I've met with personally, I'll speak first-hand, have been very open to the discussion around, providing a product that's fully integrated, provide a product that is easier to implement and easier to manage and own over time, and one that is more prepared for the future where connectivity to payers and connectivity to consumers and dealing with a bundled pace -- bundled base pricing, those kinds of things. That they understand what -- where we need to be in the next 10 years and they're focused on getting there. Having said that, they're also very focused on getting their products installed and operating and getting their Meaningful Use dollars brought in. And that's, I think, the beauty of the strategy that we announced. We are not sunsetting the Horizon product line, and we have told our customers that the Horizon Clinical product line will be invested in through the Meaningful Use cycles in getting them to where they need to be from a regulatory perspective, to receive full access to the funds. Should they choose to go to Paragon, we want to position Paragon as a go-to platform for them, and that's really been the context of the discussion. As it relates to the fiscal '13 guidance, clearly there are some revenue recognition challenges that we've mentioned in the GA discussion that Jeff had, relative to the strong last half, in fact, strong fourth quarter to be more specific relative to this business. And so as we think about our customers' success, frankly, we're investing towards their success and less focused on near-term revenue rec issues and more focused on how do we make sure that they're getting the products they need, that we're investing against those products and that they're happy customers of McKesson. There'll be a little chance to have a discussion with them about their go-forward platform if we fail them on their near-term expectations, so our focus is to invest heavily to get them to where they need to be.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a, I guess there was a comment this morning from a generic manufacturer on their conference call where they talked about the pricing on a large generic statin drug may be declining by about 96% from their -- the original brand price once you get beyond the exclusivity here in a month or 2. That could be surprising to some, not to others. I guess my general question is, since you guys hate talking about individual products. I'm just wondering whether the profitability on that, in particular large generic post-exclusivity, whether or not that's a big swing factor within your renewed guidance of $7.05 to $7.35. Or have you just taken a conservative stance in general on that product, just given its size?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, I think our -- the answer on that particular product is we've -- we planned it appropriately and conservatively, and I think it's performing the way we had expected it to, and it is frankly -- will perform based on other expert thoughts where we think it will be. So we are, as I've said in the past, we sometimes are wrong in individual molecules, not very wrong usually, but sometimes wrong and maybe timing, maybe pricing, but generally speaking, the portfolio is right. And on these bigger drugs, we're probably even more accurate, because of the import to our company, and I think we are -- are where we expected to be.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one -- a couple clarifications around guidance and one generic question. So Jeff, I think you mentioned that the June quarter, right, the implied guidance is similar to the first fiscal quarter of 2012. So just to confirm, this is as a percent of earnings, right? Not in absolute terms.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Correct, so as a percentage of earnings.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So and is 20% -- is the right percentage? I just took the $1.27 over what you've done for the year?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","I would literally, Ricky, just go back and look at the FY '12 June quarter EPS and divide it by $6.38 and that's kind of the ballpark we're in here.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then for the -- talking about fiscal year '13 being back-end loaded, so is the operating margin improvement year-over-year is also back-end loaded, especially skewed to the fourth quarter, is that how we should think about it?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, I guess I'm not sure we're giving operating margin guidance, Ricky, by quarter. I'd really just focus on the EPS and the drivers of the performance are going to vary each quarter as generics go in and out, as price increases, timing, various tax varies -- that's just the level of granularity we don't give guidance on. We feel very comfortable with the guidance for the full year of Distribution Solutions operating margin rate being up in the mid to high single digits.","John H. Hammergren","I think it probably is fair, Ricky, that the margin variation you've seen in previous quarters and years is, in some way, an indicator, at least graphically, of what you might expect. I wouldn't focus, as Jeff said, so much of the numbers, but you're going to see that kind of variability like you always do.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the generic side, can you just give us, I know you said that you saw very good growth in generics, what was the growth of generic in the quarter? And also Jeff said [ph] we had a reference point for the -- you talked about branded and generic pricing trends for next year, similar to this year, so if you can give us the context, what they were this year?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, on the price trends, to be very clear here, everybody measures price trends for both brand and generic a little differently. What we've stated in our guidance is that by whatever measurement you want to use, we're assuming that our fiscal year '13 looks similar to fiscal year '12, not better, but not worse, either. So you, we have our own metrics we use internally, but you can almost use whichever ones you want.","John H. Hammergren","And on the generic question, Ricky, I think our generic growth was in line with what we had expected and in line with where the market is. We've gotten -- we continue to get a little bit of increased penetration in our existing customer base but clearly we continue to focus on making sure that we do the right job in terms of sourcing these products as well.","Operator","We'll take the next question from George Hill with Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of housekeeping questions. Jeff, first of all, corporate expenses, a little higher than I'd modeled, was there anything, any standout items in that line this quarter?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Short answer is no. That line jumps around -- it was just due to timing differences from year-to-year. If you look at next year's plan, for example, our plan actually shows for the year the number flattish, so I wouldn't read anything into that quarterly trend. It's really just timing.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I'll give -- lob one to Jeff and one to John. Jeff, any change given how much time you guys spent talking about the health car (sic) [care] key segment that you would give us a rough overview of how much of that segment is exposed to providers, how much is exposed to payers, how much is exposed to other. And then, John, Mark has been your right-hand man on the M&A side for a long time now. With Marc moving over to the specialty business, should we have any takeaways for how the company thinks about M&A with Marc doing something else?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, let me -- I'll just quickly do the break out. So what we've said, George, is when you look at our Technology segment, which is by far the broadest collection of technology businesses in health care, you've got at this point under half the profits that come from the hospital-facing portion of that business. And you've got 2 other big chunks of that business, one is the relay connectivity business which is a very, very steady transaction processing based business and then the third component is the payer-facing business, really built around 2 tremendous product lines and franchises in InterQual, and our claims extend network.","John H. Hammergren","And before I answer the question on Marc, George, I might also point out in the hospital-facing businesses, we sometimes focus heavily on Horizon Clinicals and this Paragon discussion, even in that business we have a very strong and rapidly growing analytics business that wraps around anybody's core electronic medical record, we have a very large Medical Imaging business, you might recall that we were one of the leaders in PACS systems being installed. Our automation business is also in that hospital number that -- a reference that Jeff just made. So there are lots of pieces there that are very important to us that frankly, can rise and fall on their own performance, based on innovation and how they go to market. As it relates to Marc Owen, what's great about this team, having been together for over a decade for most of us, including Marc, there is a complete alignment around strategy and a complete alignment around capital allocation and around returns in a way we approach M&A and strategy and business development. Having said that, he's not easy to replace, and so we hope to look for someone that will bring his tremendous attributes and intellect to the party. But he's going to do a great job for us in the specialty business. As you might imagine, managing the physician space, in particular, in specialty health is extremely important. And strategically, the opportunities that are present for us in that business are quite significant. And so it's nice to have a resource that we know and we trust at the helm there that also has those skills and leadership capability. So we're delighted to have Mark assume that role and head off to Houston.","Operator","We will go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I have a 2-part question so I'll ask the first part and then follow up. The first part is that, while and I think most others probably under-modeled the warehouse sales in the quarter, which would explain the mix impact on margin, did you see any likelihood of a $5.5 billion quarter in that segment or were you surprised by the magnitude?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, I think we were surprised by the strength of the warehouse sales, and pleasantly surprised. And that's part of why the -- for the year the operating margin in Distribution Solutions might have been a basis point or so below where we thought, mainly because revenues were higher.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right, yes, I can get to that math do and I guess that is the follow-up. It's were there any other items that you'd care to talk about that impacted your margin, whether it be generics, which we've hit on today or LIFO customer contract changes, losses, et cetera, was there anything else in there that had an influence that we should be aware of?","John H. Hammergren","No, I don't think so. I just -- I think you should think about the fastest-growing drivers of both revenue in the warehouse as well as direct revenues. Growth in customers that exist and in large customers that exists, so it probably was a little bit of mix pressure, both from the warehouse but also from the people in direct, that might have been benefiting from some of the industry challenges that were going on in those big metropolitan markets where you have lots of chains competing with each other. Those chains that were our customers that might have won business would have been lower margin, typically, than the independent stores or other people in our base. So I think that mixing works through both of those revenue lines. But we're still pleased, obviously with the margin performance in the business, and if you actually look underlying the covers, you take that revenue and normalize it a little bit, we're making the kind of progress we expect it to.","Operator","And that's all the time we have today for questions. I'll turn the call back over to Erin Lampert for any closing comments.","John H. Hammergren","Well, I'm going to close up here, and I'll give it to Erin in just a moment. I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. We had a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our expectations for a solid performance in going into 2013 are certainly here, and our opportunity to continue to deploy capital in an appropriate way and in a portfolio way will allow us to continue, I think, to drive value for our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Erin.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. We'll participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 15, and the Goldman Sachs health care conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 5. We'll release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, Anthony. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 first-quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the SEC, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Craig. And thanks everyone for joining us on our call.","Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2018. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $51 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.46, consistent with our expectations. Combined with our share repurchases we completed in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share.","Before I dive into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress that demonstrates our continued commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of distribution businesses. In the past quarter, we announced the signing of three acquisitions primarily in the specialties space.","We closed four acquisitions, including CoverMyMeds, in early April and we started the important work to integrate Rexall and other recent acquisitions which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth. Each of these acquisitions that we've announced or are in the process of integrating, highlight our commitment to expand our specialty capabilities, enhance our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers and grow our retail pharmacy footprint internationally.","Second, we continue to make progress on the strategic shift to realign our businesses to focus on distribution and retail pharmacy solutions following the creation of Change Healthcare. This quarter represents the first time we include the results for our equity investment in Change Healthcare; the new company was created to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care.","Change Healthcare is now a focused and scaled enterprise executing on this mission. Additionally, I'm encouraged by the recent developments in our pursuit of the strategic alternatives for our Enterprise Information Solutions business, and I expect we will have more to announce in the near-term.","Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few matters specific to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter driven by organic growth.","Next I want to provide an update on the pricing environment as we've transitioned into fiscal 2018. We entered this year with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single-digits and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of this assumption. Additionally, you'll recall that during fiscal 2017, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes from McKesson. Over time we adjusted our strategy and we were able to recapture that lost volume, retain our share, and build upon our longstanding relationships. Consistent with our update over the last two quarters, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S., albeit, with less pricing variability. We expect to lap the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of our fiscal 2018 second quarter.","Next I'd like to discuss ClarusONE. We are pleased with the progress we've made so far in our manufacturer discussions and we are in line with our plan. McKesson continues to be encouraged by our partnership with Walmart and we are looking at opportunities in which we can expand the relationship. We're also pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brands, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturing partners in the each of the five categories. We continue to address these important changes, as we work through contract renewal cycles.","Turning to Rite Aid's recent announced asset purchase agreement. Based on public comments made by Walgreens, they indicate an anticipated six-month regulatory review, followed by a six-month phased transition period. Therefore, we continue to anticipate a full-year contribution from Rite Aid in our fiscal 2018 guidance. I would also like to call out our recently announced acquisition of BDI Pharma, which allows us to provide our customers with broader plasma and related offerings and complement our current health system in alternate site channels. We also expect to bring more value to our manufacture partners through increased scale and customer penetration.","Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We recently announced the closing of our acquisition of intraFUSION which further strengthens our multi-specialty offerings and through our commitment to the transition to value-based care, we support approximately 800 physicians who participated in the CMS Oncology Care Model over the last year. This represents greater than 1\/3 of all participating providers being supported by McKesson Specialty Health, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.","Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter, which results \u2013 with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses, similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on full-line distribution, specialty and infusion services and owned and banner retail pharmacies. We're making progress on the Rexall integration, which further enhances McKesson's retail pharmacy capacities, procurement scale and leading pharmacy care for patients across Canada.","We've also broadened our specialty offerings upon closing the acquisition of GMV Distribution. GMV is a leading provider of specialty pharmaceuticals and expands our multi-specialty presence across Canada, while further strengthening our current physician and manufacturing relationships.","Finally, our recent CoverMyMeds acquisition is now part of the newly formed McKesson Prescription Technology Services business. CoverMyMeds automates and accelerates the prescription approval process, known as electronic prior authorization, which is otherwise manual and time-consuming and therefore takes administrative costs out of the system. CoverMyMeds allows us to support patient health through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment, and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications. We're excited about the meaningful improvements this technology represents for these stakeholders.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter was $6.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and operating performance from Celesio was in line with our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to monitor reimbursement developments in the UK, we remain encouraged by the growth delivered by the rest of the Celesio enterprise. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, driven by market growth, including strong performance from our recent investment in laboratory distribution.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter and as I noted in my earlier remarks, we are encouraged by the progress made by management of Change Healthcare, since its creation just over a quarter ago.","Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are raising our full-year outlook for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings to a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled global sourcing capabilities, expanded global retail footprint, growing specialty business in the U.S. and overseas, and our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers.","We're extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions, when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share which reflects our first quarter results that were very much in line with our expectations and the positive full-year impact of incremental share repurchases completed in the quarter.","Please note the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today, unless stated otherwise. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.46, which excludes the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments.","You may recall that when we provided our initial guidance and further commentary at our Investor Day, we noted the quarterly progression of our fiscal 2018 performance, being back-half weighted. This timing reflects, in part, our ongoing contract renewal work with our customers and manufacturer partners, where we are reflecting the differential economics of brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC products, as John mentioned previously.","These ongoing contract renewals, also reflect reduced variability in our compensation, resulting from manufacturer pricing actions. Our ongoing success with these contract renewals did however create a timing headwind for our Q1 earnings.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 4% in constant currency. First quarter adjusted gross profit was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the planned lapping effect of increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business, weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, some timing items driven by our ongoing contractual renewal progress with certain manufacturer partners, and lower profit in our Technology Solutions business driven primarily by the contribution of the majority of businesses to Change Healthcare, partially offset by acquisitions and organic growth including the ClarusONE joint sourcing entity.","First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% in constant currency, driven by acquisitions, partially offset by the Change Healthcare transaction and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $13 million for the quarter, a decrease of 43% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare, was $70 million for the first quarter. We are pleased with the progress of Change Healthcare; the management team has come together to cohesively lead the new organization and begin the work of both identifying opportunities to further expand our customer relationships, and realizing meaningful synergies.","I'd like to reiterate our prior guidance, that Change Healthcare will generate between $370 million and $430 million of pre-tax earnings, reflecting our 70% ownership of the joint venture. At the same time, we have made a refinement to our estimate of the way tax expense is attributed to the joint venture's profits. Including tax expenses, now expected to be accounted for within Change Healthcare, we project our adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Again, this reflects no material change in our full-year expectation for pre-tax earnings to be generated by the Change Healthcare joint venture; rather, it is a refinement in where taxes are reflected in our income statement.","Our full-year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 25%, down from our original estimate of 27%. The net effect of these two updates is neutral to the original guidance for fiscal 2018 that we provided in May. Also note that we do not expect a cash tax impact to McKesson as a result of this refinement.","Now, continuing down the income statement, interest expense of $68 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was approximately 26.5% for the quarter. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests or NCI was $56 million for the quarter, an increase of 217% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year was primarily driven by ClarusONE, our fully operational, joint sourcing entity with Walmart.","Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $523 million, with our first quarter adjusted EPS at $2.46 per diluted share, down 22%, compared to $3.15 in the prior period. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 213 million, down 7% compared to the prior period.","Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $50.9 billion. On a constant currency basis revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Revenues were impacted by approximately $400 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 6% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $300 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.","In mid-July, the UK government announcement further reimbursement cuts. We are assessing both the economic impact of these changes on McKesson and potential business initiatives to help mitigate these government actions.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the first quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 7% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth, including contributions from ClarusONE, partially offset by the planned lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the expected weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends.","Let me, for a moment, touch on branded pharmaceutical price increases. The June quarter has traditionally included modest brand price increases and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of the assumption included in our plan. I would remind you that in addition to timing, frequency and magnitude, the mix of which manufacturers initiate price adjustments has an important affect on our overall compensation.","Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions, partially offset by ongoing cost management efforts. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was down 10% in constant currency year-over-year at $887 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 173 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 28 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, as well as our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the beneficial contribution from ClarusONE.","We continue to expect our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. Our operating margin rates will be supported by organic growth, including the contribution from ClarusONE, recent acquisitions and the lapping of previously discussed headwinds as we proceed through the year.","Now moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018 MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business. Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $61 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare was $17 million.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior year, to 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 1 day from the prior year to 29 days and our days sales in payables was flat to the prior year at 59 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion held offshore. And in the first quarter, McKesson generated $741 million in cash flow from operations.","We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach in fiscal 2018 priorities. In the first quarter, we spent $118 million on internal capital investments, and we paid $541 million in long-term debt. We also repurchased $250 million in common stock in the first quarter. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $212 million for the full year. And we now have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We also paid $1.5 billion for acquisitions during the first quarter, which included the closing of CoverMyMeds as previously announced on April 3.","And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.34, an increase of $0.06 or 21%. This dividend will be payable to shareholders in October, and reflects our commitment to the dividend as a part of our portfolio approach to capital deployment.","Now let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. While Rite Aid has announced a new transaction with Walgreens, our guidance range continues to assume a full-year full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40.","Based on Walgreens' public comments, that they expect the regulatory review of this new transaction to take approximately six months, and that if approved, the stalls involved would be transitioned over a subsequent six-month period, we feel comfortable with our fiscal 2018 assumption. And as you think about the cadence of our earnings in fiscal 2018, I'd like to reiterate my previous comments that our results will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year.","Consistent with our historical experience, we expect the fourth quarter to be the strongest. Also, in our second quarter, we will continue to be impacted by a lapping effect from last year's increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business. Throughout the remainder of the year, we will benefit from the increasing contribution of ClarusONE, additional organic growth and our recent acquisitions.","In closing, McKesson delivered first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. In addition, our cash flow generation allowed us to address each of these four pillars of our capital deployment strategy, and our Q1 share repurchases are driving our updated fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook of $11.80 to $12.50.","Thank you and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much and good morning. James, let me just start with trying to understand the cadence of the earnings. I understand you were talking about it being more heavily back-half weighted, but given where the Street was in this quarter versus what you delivered and where you said this was in line with your expectations, I just want to make sure that we have this lined up correctly, especially as we think about next quarter and think about having to lap some of the pricing issues; is there anything more that you can give us directionally as we think about the second quarter?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, obviously a few factors driving the quarterization of the fiscal 2018 guide, in particular, Q1 was impacted by that lapping effect of last year's activity, enhanced pricing activity around the independent pharmacy space, and then also, as we had assumed going into the fiscal year, we did see lesser brand manufacturer price increase activity than we've seen in some other years. And also made note at the start of my remarks, as to in Q1 in particular, there were two contracts with the manufacturers as we went through our renewal process, that is focusing our activity on the relevant economics for each of the five categories of our work, that both John and I referred to, namely the brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC, but also those renewals focused on our interest in seeing less variability to the branded manufacturer pricing actions. Of course, we don't take those decisions, so it's helpful for us to have a little less variability to pricing.","And so that issue in particular, those two contract renewals did have an impact on Q1 and there will be a beneficial impact later in the year. Not surprisingly, we always see Q4 as the strongest of the quarters, given that that is traditionally when branded manufacturers take the majority of their price increases. And then the other factors to really think through is, as the year proceeds, we'll continue to see nice organic growth across the businesses and also, obviously, we invested substantially in acquisitions over the last 12 to 18 months. So, as those new parts of our company progress against their business cases, I'm expecting that we'll see additional earnings benefits from them as the year progresses.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, great. And then, just my follow-up would be for John. John, in your prepared comments, you made a comment that you feel that things have stabilized, and they're (28:15) competitive when we think about the independent market for generics. Can you just maybe give us a little more color as to what you're really seeing in the market and what gives you that confidence?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think at the time that we talked about this unusual activity in the prior year, during the prior year, I made the comment that we had \u2013 we don't see that type of activity frequently, and when we've seen it in the past, it tended to stabilize or revert back to competitive, but less variable over time. And I think that, that prognosis or forecast in terms of where we thought things would go has proven to be accurate, and obviously, things can change at any point in time, but I would say that we've gone back to an environment which is competitive, but certainly not out of line with the kind of competitive activity that we would have typically seen prior to fiscal 2017. So I would say that that's the best way I could characterize it, is it's back to competitive and less variable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the color. Maybe thinking a little bit and building off of Lisa's question a bit more, as you think about some of the other moving pieces that get better into the back half of the year, particularly the pricing environment, I guess, how do you check the growth points along the line to make sure that what you think about relative to brand inflation which I think you said came in little bit better, generic deflation, all against the backdrop of some of the contract changes are falling in line with your plans? And I guess, how much visibility at this point, do you have into some of those changes?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think it's fair to say that when we had our guidance discussion at the end of our fiscal year and again at our Analyst Meeting, we talked very specifically about how we saw the year playing out and I guess what we're seeing today is it's playing out as we had anticipated it would play out. We may not have done an effective job of messaging it to you given where the Street has been in the quarter, but clearly it's in line with our expectations and we typically have pretty good visibility throughout the year. And as James mentioned, if you think about our renewal cycle of both with our customers and our large manufacturing partners, you can clearly see how the changes in those relationships will be reflected in future financial results.","And so, I would say, on those dimensions, clearly we have better visibility and perhaps less variability than we would have had in an environment where we were more dependent on price increases as a piece of our business model. Clearly, we can't entirely forecast acquisitions with 100% certainty, but we have a pretty good track record of getting the synergies out of the capital we deploy and giving the returns to our investors that are appropriate given the risk that we take and the other alternatives like buying our stock back.","So, if you believe the three principle drivers are the sort of the calenderization of our earnings with manufacturers, the impact of acquisitions as they get closed and integrated, and things like NorthStar, our private label products and the higher growth and our higher margin businesses frankly, we can see that with pretty good, accuracy. So, I think that we would not have confirmed our guidance here and the raise, as James mentioned, was related to the share repurchases. We would not have done that, if we didn't believe that it was an accurate representation of our belief going forward.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it at one.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Maybe just a quick update on how some of the recent acquisitions are sort of trending, particularly some of the maybe the newer businesses to you, like Rexall or Biologics, so just love to understand how they're doing versus sort of their base M&A case when you bought them?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Right. I think that as I said earlier, we have a pretty good track record in realizing the synergies that we forecast and I would say that we're generally in line on these acquisitions in terms of their performance. Biologics might be performing slightly ahead of its acquisition case and we've been very pleased with that acquisition, and Rexall is really in line with this \u2013 I'd say a little bit newer than Biologics is. And then the rest of our acquisitions like CoverMyMeds, et cetera, are all performing at or above our expectations.","So, I'm quite pleased with not only the performance financially, but the strategic position that these acquisitions put us in. As you can imagine, we are investing in higher margin businesses in the case of Biologics and CoverMyMeds, et cetera, and we're investing in businesses that in the case of Rexall that are not only higher margin, but they're also allowing us to have more control over the selection of product, and that control allows us to deliver more value to the manufacturers that we do business with. And so, it's part of a long-term strategy, frankly, on both of those fronts to be more exposed to specialty, because of its higher growth and be more meaningful to manufacturers. James, you might have something to add.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","And while we don't look at this in our business cases that underpin the acquisitions themselves, I've been pleased so far with the opportunities that are starting to evolve for groups like CoverMyMeds to work with other parts of our business, Relay Pharmacy for example on the Rexall side, the discussions that are really ongoing now with other parts of retail across our organization. So that's not a short-term synergy opportunity. It's not something that's part of the business case, but I'm encouraged that there's quite an opportunity I think over the longer-term for us to really benefit from this portfolio of assets that we've built up over the years.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","And I also mentioned, Ross, in my comments about Med-Surg and our exposure to laboratory and our entrance into the lab business, principally in the physician space, but also in the smaller hospitals where they've been underserved from a laboratory supply perspective, and that business is growing nicely for us and it's higher margin and higher growth than the baseline businesses. So, we think we're well positioned.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe just as a follow-up, historically you guys have been tremendous stewards of capital and M&A has always been a hallmark, and I always think of you as being a pretty creative and value-based buyer. I guess, in an environment with where we are with multiples, et cetera, how would you sort of characterize more the mid-to-small size tuck-ins that you guys typically do? What does that environment look like? Is there a pretty ease in pipeline or valuations still amenable in certain areas? How are you sort of thinking about just the overall backdrop?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","First, thanks for the compliment, and we appreciate the fact that we've represented good stewards of capital, and that we have a track record of executing. And clearly, if you overpay, there's no ability to create value and so, that discipline upfront is extremely important. But, I'd say, as evidenced by the frequency of our acquisitions in the last year and already into this year, you can see we find creative spots to deploy capital and to your point about sort of innovation and creativity, we're typically not (35:51), that are all chasing the deal or chasing an opportunity. We have our teams focused on building relationships with potential sellers long before they're interested in selling, and then we create a positive environment for those transactions to be completed.","And for their teams to continue to come to McKesson and deliver not only value to us, but careers for themselves, and that combination makes us an attractive partner. When many times these companies are privately owned or certainly heavily influenced by the entrepreneurs that may own them, we're a good place for people to continue to grow and develop and be rewarded for their performance. And I think that makes us a preferred alternative in many cases. So, obviously, when multiples start to trade up, it makes it more difficult, but we're patient, and we'll wait for the right opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, John and James. I guess more of a big picture question on procurement. So, distributors have clearly gained share and enlarged the pie, in terms of level of generics purchased through you for a variety of reasons. But from a high level, could you describe what that does to the marketplace from a procurement perspective? So, for example, in North America, you've completed signing contracts with the new retail client via ClarusONE and now one of your peers is embarking on adding a PBM, and then incremental retail line. So, does that cause any disruption in your contracting or does that impact your assumptions in terms of generic contributions, as maybe pricing deflates at a different rate or other factors investors should think about as these types of events occur?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think it's a good question and a complex question. I would say that as a backdrop, I believe that the large buyers of generics are relatively comparable in terms of what we're attempting to do, and the results that we're achieving. I would say that clearly incremental volume plays a role in all of this, but I think that the difference between any of us at any one time is not significant, and I think McKesson and certain molecules with certain manufacturers would be superior and in other cases, others may beat us. But if you put it all together as a basket, I'm pretty confident we buy as well as anyone.","As it relates to the deflation environment related to our activity in the procurement side, clearly we're trying to get the best deal we possible can for ourselves and for our customers, and we want to make sure that our customers are receiving a competitive price for the service and value that we deliver including the product price.","Having said all of that, the deflation that occurs through better sourcing is not an automatic pass-through into the marketplace. We want to make sure we are competitive, but at the same time, obviously the investment to create a ClarusONE needs to be appropriately funded, and provide us the appropriate returns. And so we're focused on making sure that we are responsible for returning to our investors against those investments and that'll continue to be our focus.","So, I think we're optimistic that our procurement activity will continue to be best-in-class and we will continue to add capabilities there over time and maybe new product categories and obviously new customers et cetera, but I feel pretty comfortable we're managing it appropriately.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","And perhaps just to add on to that from a more technical perspective, as we look at the economic drivers of our results, our ability to flow through effectively on the generic side in this deflationary type environment has net-net been supportive to our results.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And changing gears a little bit, on Rite Aid, you mentioned you're using public Walgreens comments and your assumptions for the year on the portion that Walgreens is taking over, but how do you think of the rest of the business where there's also a part of that deal, some pricing terms for the reminder of Rite Aid. Should they continue to or would they want to use Walgreen? So, the rest of the business, how you're thinking about it, as to what the realistic options are?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, clearly, we're pleased for both Walgreens and Rite Aid, that they've been able to find a new deal that they believe, they'll be successful with and obviously, we're also pleased that that new deal has some remainder of Rite Aid, not only the corporate side of the entity of Rite Aid, but certainly a large portion of their stores that will remain. And that we've been a long-term valued partner with Rite Aid. And I certainly would hope and expect that relationship would continue. Clearly, the economics for both Rite Aid and McKesson change with their smaller enterprise and we've attempted to reflect to you, what the full enterprise is worth to us, in terms of revenue and earnings. So, at least you have some boundaries as to how valuable the business is to us, and what it might be to us going forward as you describe.","So, I think we believe, we can compete very well with anything that our competitors would provide, and we compete very well with anything that our other sourcing entities can provide from a value perspective, and we're hopeful that we'll continue a long-term relationship with Rite Aid well past the transaction with Walgreens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, John and James. So just based on simple math, I mean the SG&A seem to be pretty high in the quarter with distribution gross profits growing 4% to 5%, but distribution EBIT down about 10% year-over-year, and just based on your comment, it seems like the biggest delta on getting that gross profit growth and EBIT growth is closer to each other for the rest of the year is mainly acquisition, integration, is that an accurate assessment or are there other key factors there?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I would say that there are more variables that are at play; it's really the combination of the opportunity for organic growth right across the businesses, as well as the impact of acquisitions. And then obviously, we've discussed the ebbing of this lapping effect around sell-side independent pharmacy space. In terms of the expense side of the ledger, we've talked about how we've been looking to invest some in expenses, particularly focused around information technology investments in the coming year.","On the other side of the coin, one of the attributes that I was very pleased about in terms of the U.S. Pharma, our performance in Q1 was the productivity efficiency that they were generating out of that part of the business as a result of our ongoing capital expenditure investments and other process improvements that they've made in that business. So we'll continue to invest in process improvements that we think can improve the competitiveness of our cost structure that will take some incremental expense in the short run, and we think that that will be worth it in the longer run.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just a quick follow up on that, just on the M&A. You mentioned that some of the recent acquisitions were higher margin, it might be tough to answer this on the fly, but when we do look at that 4% to 5% gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions in the quarter, do you know how much of the acquisitions contributed to that growth versus what that growth might have been organically in the quarter, is there any just rough assessment of that?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, we don't bring that out specifically, but obviously those acquisitions are going to build gradually, so I wouldn't want to overstate the impact of those acquisitions in the first year or so. When we've announced acquisitions like CoverMyMeds for example, we noted that come year three, we'd be driving between $0.30-$0.40 of accretion from that acquisition. But that builds gradually particularly in that first year, where oftentimes there is some additional investment spending that goes into the equation for us to be able to really drive that accretion in the second year and third year and so forth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the questions. I guess just want to go back to the SG&A, James, I guess I'm still just a bit confused. I think everyone was anticipating the headwinds in the quarter coming from the things that arose in 2Q last year, the branded pricing and the competitive environment, but really relative to expectations the short fall this quarter was from SG&A and in particular it looks like from Distribution Solutions scope. Can you just go back and maybe explain a little bit more what exactly happened in the quarter relative to operating expenses and how should we think about those as we progress through the year?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, another item that is relevant on the expense side of the ledger is obviously, that we've reset our assumptions around various variable compensation programs, and so forth. So that becomes an element of the equation and in certain of our geographies, there were some additional expense resets around salaries and so forth. So, a variety of different factors, but overall, we feel comfortable with the level of spend, as I say, the focus on the investments to drive down expenses over time and right across the management team, we're very focused on improving our spend performance quarter by quarter.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","And I'd also say, Robert, the spend level in the quarter was not something that was a surprise to us. It was factored into our planning when we gave you the full-year guidance. So, I would say that the way the P&L has played out for us in the quarter is in line with what we expected it to be when we gave you the original guidance months ago and that's only the additional cover I give you. It may be surprising to you, but we had factored this in because we could see the investment in the mix changes and the acquisitions et cetera, as we looked at the quarter.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that makes sense, John. I think, we, obviously, were focused more on the headwinds that had come up last year, and I think that's where it probably differed in the model. But I guess, James, just if I could go over to pricing, I wanted to get a better understanding of what you guys are seeing on generic pricing, and in particular I'm thinking about the buy side part of the equation; how has that trended relative to expectations?","And then probably, more importantly, as you guys look forward given some of the FDA's recent statements and goals of accelerating generic approvals, how do you foresee generic pricing playing out into the future?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, on the generic manufacturer side of things, we went into the year assuming a very nominal benefit from those molecules where we would be seeing price inflation and that's very much as things are playing out, very limited effects there. On the broader generic molecule spectrum, we've been talking earlier in one of our responses about the deflation environment, and net-net, I observed that for our sourcing capacities, or our in-house capabilities as such that we see this environment as a net driver of our overall economic, so we're happy with the situation there.","In terms of the FDA and there a part to drive more approvals and therefore potentially put greater numbers of manufacturers into a specific molecule, obviously, you've got an overall supply-demand balancing equation there that will impact the pricing environment net-net, it is a generic type marketplace after all. But I would just offer also that in some of those circumstances the FDA is focused on a molecule where there's any one manufacturer today, and so they're interested in having two or three manufacturers and that can actually provide a helpful environment again for our sourcing capabilities to be able to drive better value for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, good morning. So, first of all, just a follow up on the question on the SG&A. So just to clarify going forward now that these acquisitions are part of the business. Is that the state that we should model between COGS and gross profits versus operating expenses?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think it's fair to say that, as John was alluding to, these figures were very much in line with our plan and so, as we're bringing on acquisitions in the year-over-year expense base, you're obviously going to see step function increases commensurate with bringing on those acquired expense basis. So I would again rest assure that we'll continue our ongoing focus on cost management, but directionally, yes, you'll see some step function increases as the likes of Rexall come into the P&L for example.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","And I think also, Ricky, one of the challenges from the P&L perspective is that the incremental profit delivered by the acquisitions even in the first order before we realized the synergies was vastly offset by the year-over-year lapping problem that James mentioned earlier related to independent price effects in the prior year. So when you think about why didn't we see a margin lift in terms of the acquisitions and all we saw was the expense lift is, because the margin lift from the acquisitions could easily be offset by the two dimensions that James mentioned. One is the lapping effect of independent pricing last year, and the effect of our continued work from the manufacturer contracting perspective that we talked about previously.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So what would be really helpful for us is if you can just help us quantify what's the magnitude of these headwinds that we're reaping (50:55) when we think about just the combination of the price competition and independent and (51:01) pharmaceutical pricing. So we can kind of in fact normalize that it sounds like run rate as we think about second half?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. I don't have that for you on this call. We would certainly think through how we might articulate that effect going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Company.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Question on ClarusONE; is there a cadence declarence for ClarusONE in terms of the profitability over the course of the year? I'm assuming it will grow and become more profitable as the year progresses. That's the first question on ClarusONE. The second one is, you talk about other opportunities with Walmart and with ClarusONE, is this the kind of relationship where you could get in and help the medical side of your business as well? Are you going to be able to get into products and the like there?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I'll let James talk about the cadence, and I'll talk about the product portfolio. James?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","In terms of the cadence, you're right, I would expect that to build profit contribution as the quarters of the year go by, and obviously, in the last few months, we've really just been getting started and we're very pleased with the momentum that, that team is building around sourcing results. So, yeah, I'd be absolutely looking for a steady build as the year goes along.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","It's difficult for me to perhaps articulate what opportunities would be in front of us like Clarus, because we have a partner there that needs to engage in that opportunity as well. So I'm not speaking that behalf of Walmart. But if you wanted to look at opportunities, you certainly could think about everything that a Walmart store in the U.S. purchases today, and think about what McKesson would also be purchasing for our clients and non-Walmart clients, and all of those would provide opportunities for us to move them to ClarusONE in a way that would be perhaps productive for both companies and our combined customers. I would also say that ClarusONE is specifically focused on U.S. so there might be other U.S. Walmart opportunities as well as global opportunities that both companies could bring together.","And last, I would say on the medical side, we clearly are heavily focused on our medical business in private label and our global sourcing activity, which is outside of ClarusONE has been very effective at driving value for us on the medical products that are typically used in the alternate site settings that we focus on. And that, I consider that separate and distinct for medical products that are sold at retail pharmacies like over-the-counter items, which would be closer to home to Clarus, but both are opportunities for us.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And if I can do one quick follow-up. I'm a little confused on the impact of the manufacturer contracting and sort of how that works; why would something like that become more profitable over the course of the year? Is there an exclusive on a product launch or a generic or something like that? I just don't really understand how that would work?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I won't be able to get into the specifics of these two particular contracts with some of the larger manufacturers, but it did create in essence a headwind for Q1 and we would look for a smoother introduction of contribution for us in the quarters remaining in the year, Q2 through Q4. So, in the net result, which we're pleased about is less variability around a manufacturer's pricing actions. Obviously we don't take those decisions. So, we're interested in smoothing out the impact on our P&L from the actions of others.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. I think that's absolutely accurate, and once again, we had anticipated the outcome of these relationship changes when we provided the original guidance, and I think if there's a reflection on the disconnect, it really is our ability to articulate what we were doing in our business. At the two major points, we had an opportunity to articulate them apparently, was not as clear as it could have been and that's why you guys look at this quarter and say, gee, it seems odd compared to what we expected. But I want to once again confirm and reaffirm what James said is that it's certainly in line with what we expected and we expect that the following three quarters will be in line with what we expect as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. I think you mentioned that North American pharma revenue was up organically year-over-year. Can you talk a bit more about that? How much of that is being driven by price versus volumes and if you're winning share in the market, any color around which channel it's coming from; hospitals, retails, independent doc offices? Any more color on that growth would be very helpful. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the question. Clearly, we're pleased with the growth of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our position in the marketplace. As we've said in the past, we typically focus on gaining share of wallet within our existing customers where they're buying product that they're not buying from us or in some cases, entering product categories or expanding their presence in categories where both of us are finding incremental revenues. I think clearly there's just flat out market growth. So, I would not \u2013 I don't think our revenue growth in our business is that far outside of what the market is growing, if you think about specialty and just straight out demographics. So I think that clearly whatever price happens in the market flows through our business, and the volumes are probably pretty typical with what the volumes are from a growth perspective at a baseline.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then you also mentioned tech pharmacy solutions. Is that like a new entity within your organization and like what is in that? And did that get classed in the distribution division and is that like, I guess, group of assets driving up operating expenses in the quarter relative to last year?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","So the business you're referring to is the coming together of three previous sub-businesses if you will. One that focuses historically on distributing technologies to pharmacists to help them manage their business, then the Relay Pharmacy business, which is a switch business, across which so many transactions between the pharmacy and the payer move, and then also the new acquisition of CoverMyMeds. So, I was alluding, earlier in one of my answers, to the opportunities that we're seeing for new improvements across these businesses and I'm pleased that we've been able to bring them together under a single preservant to really drive the full opportunities that we think these assets provide. I think they can be higher growth. John mentioned, they're higher margin, so there will be a particular focus on these businesses going forward.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","But as it relates to the change period-over-period, the biggest change is the movement of CoverMyMeds into McKesson and the movement out of MTS of our Relay Pharmacy business, and these businesses will carry a higher expense rate as it relates to revenue, but they carry a much higher margin as well, and once again, the margin impact to the segment was probably muted by the year-over-year lapping of the previous discussed independent pharmacy price challenges that we face. So you have a situation where the expenses come in, and the incremental margin got absorbed in the lap, and that's why you have a more difficult compare.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just digging deeper into branded pricing, especially since we're in July for mid-year. So you talked about it being slightly above expectations. Would you mind just giving some color on, are we seeing that on the rate or is it the number of price increases? And then, if you don't mind just also giving us what percentage of your gross profit dollars are still tied to pricing. I think before you've said it's around 10%. Thanks.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. I'd say the contribution from our branded manufacturer partners is still around 90% on a fixed type basis around 10 points of it coming from more variable measures around price increases, so the manufacturers take. In terms of what's going on around the branded manufacturer pricing environment, we are seeing little bit less of a frequency, it's fair to say, but also as we said in our text, the mix of which manufacturers take the price increases is important to our economics, because obviously we have a blend of contract structures some are entirely fixed and others offer us a portion of the economics that we can earn as a result of a price increase activity.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I think we have time operator for one last question. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's James (01:01:19) on for Charles. You mentioned earlier in the call that you're encouraged by recent developments in the pursuit of strategic alternatives for EIS. Can you elaborate on that, what new developments?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thanks for the question. Clearly, we've been focused on making sure that we think about the strategic alternatives for our EIS business. We believed there were other places where that business might be able to grow more rapidly than inside of McKesson and we've been pursuing evaluation of those strategic alternatives and my comments were nothing more than to reinforce the fact that we \u2013 the process continues to be underway and that we're encouraged by the level of interest in alternatives that we're seeing and we hope to have more news here in the short term.","I want to thank you, operator, for helping us today, and thanks to all of you on your call \u2013 on the call for you time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2018 and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible.","I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Craig Mercer - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thank you, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Craig, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $49.9 billion, up 5%, and earnings per diluted share of $3.53, up 18%, both on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017.","Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed seven acquisitions including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case. And we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.","Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower health care costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new health care information technology company will offer complementary capabilities that will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward.","Last, in May we announced a strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company, not just on the logistics side, but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership, but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart and we were the right partner.","Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. First it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry. We've had a very busy first quarter and are encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives.","Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis, and Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes US pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis, despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidations that occurred late in fiscal 2016.","Revenue at our US pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the US under our new five-year distribution agreement, and I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals.","I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare Conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart has grown by 50% over the past three years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver, and be recognized for, top clinical performance, and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business.","Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve, and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business.","Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's AccessHealth provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to, and compete in, preferred networks. In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers, and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition.","Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, we again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in our oncology and other multi-specialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment toward the transition to value-based care.","The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the oncology care model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality for highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare. Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that includes financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care.","Earlier this month, we announced that 12 practices affiliated with the US Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented one fourth of all participating physicians, and if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.","The OCM marks a major milestone in the shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective, and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care.","Moving to our Canadian business, we had nice growth in the quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses similar to those in the US, with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year over year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance from Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the UK.","While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the UK government effective in April and June this year which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year. Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes, as well as the UKs decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term range growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty.","And finally, our medical-surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior-year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior-year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in the segment was 4%.","In summary, I am pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior-year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","Technology Solutions' operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses including favorable timing and lower operating expenses.","We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future of changed healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment.","Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As John mentioned, today we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational, or baseline view, of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year.","During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.","Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share which excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on schedules two and three of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency.","I'll now refer you to slides three and four of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year over year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions, and an incremental pre-text gain related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity.","First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency for the quarter.","Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards.","For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million.","I'll now refer you to slide five of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year over year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year over year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million.","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our US pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the medical-surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year's sale of the ZEE Medical business.","I'll now refer you to slide six of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds, and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year.","As we've discussed previously, the year over year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal 2017. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price.","Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pre-tax gain related to an anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2016 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $59 million related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, so the year over year impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect that branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.","Let's move now to slide seven of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the cost alignment plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.","I'll now refer you to slide eight in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. Segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin.","Now turning back to schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","I will now refer you to slides nine and ten of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal 2017. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the cost alignment plan.","Let's now move to slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days.","We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $217 million (24:37) in expected cash payments related to the combination of the cost alignment plan and a settlement with the US government, which we previously disclosed in April of 2015.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter.","We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing seven acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.","I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year over year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the cost alignment plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29.","And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal 2017 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share.","Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Justin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks and good afternoon. In the 10-Q tonight I noticed that there was a comment on Distribution Solutions gross margin being impacted by lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer. I'm sure that's a fairly obvious item, I can guess at what manufacturer that might be, but I'd love any commentary you have on that, and just want to make sure it's not more of a sector theme as opposed to a one-off situation.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Eric, for the question. I think your perspective is probably correct, and I would like to just further by saying our relationship with the branded manufacturers remains pretty consistent across the board. Our contracts renew on a regular basis with very minor modifications to the terms typically. And what you see here is just basically a difference in the yield year on year from an existing agreement with an existing supplier.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And again, John, you think that's clearly a one-time item with this one manufacturer?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well certainly the magnitude of it is. If you think about the year on year change in pricing behavior, that's really what's the driver behind it.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks very much.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question will come from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. First I guess I'll take the obligatory generic inflation moderation question. In your prepared remarks, you sort of reiterated your expectation of nominal contributions to earnings. But could you just elaborate a little bit further as to what you've seen since last quarter, just to give us more insight?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Really, it's been a very similar theme in recent months, so it wouldn't likely point to any particularly notable change quarter over quarter.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then on implementing Walmart, congratulations on that deal, but could you discuss the timeline of when this will occur? You mentioned it being operational by the end of fiscal 2017, but I'm wondering what are the critical steps that are preventing some of the benefits from occurring earlier? So for example, wouldn't at least some of your current contracts be tiered for additional volume so that you could benefit from incremental scale sooner?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well our agreements, as you point out, are in place today, and one of the things we will be doing as we go to market with the new Walmart relationship will be modifying those agreements to reflect some of the incremental volume delivered by Walmart. But really a combination of the terms and other features of these contracts exist with both organizations. And I do think there clearly is some nominal value that may be delivered in FY 2017. We really think that the preponderance of the value will be delivered in FY 2018, and I think that's consistent with what we've said before, and that's still what we think, Garen.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd just add to that, that it does take some months to ramp up the physical side of these relationships, and that was very much the case when we implemented the broader relationship with Rite Aid, for example.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Got it. Thanks again.","Operator","And moving on to Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. John, obviously you're closing on the, you have the Rexall business in Canada. You are running retail operations in the UK, and with Health Mart you have obviously kind of a franchise business. Any reason at some point in the future with the way the retail market is consolidating in the US, does that ever create an option for you to branch back into the domestic side, on the US side of the business, into a retail pharmacy?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think we've been asked the question before, obviously, and our chosen path in the US is to partner with our customers. And as you mentioned, independents in particular have been great partners and a growing base of our business, particularly the transition of our customer base from just buying wholesale services from us to being partners in the Health Mart business. And that really is a much more intimate relationship and one where the customer benefits significantly from our involvement, and clearly we do as well because they buy more and more of their product and service requirements from us.","We have lots of other customers that are very successful in competing in this market, and frankly we just don't see it, an alternative for us to enter the market directly, both that would benefit us, but also at the same time allow us to provide additional benefit to our customers. So I just don't see us entering the retail space directly in the US, but we'll continue to support our customers as we have in the past.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Appreciated. And then as a follow-up, if we look at the regional chains, outside as of the big major retail chains, can you talk about sort of your share in sort of the more regional chains across the US, and sort of what that landscape looks like? And do those tend to be Health Mart customers or when we think about Health Mart, or think about even smaller kind of numbers, owned stores? Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well yeah, you're welcome. Most of the regional chains have their own very strong brands and particularly if they're part of a combination where they're selling groceries or warehousing kind of marketing tools, there probably is little interest for them to use the Health Mart brand. But obviously, we'd be open to them participating with Health Mart any way that we can. I would say the preponderance of our Health Mart stores are independent stores, and they'd be aggregated into regional chain-like setups, but that they would still be small in terms of total numbers of stores per aggregator, if that's the way to explain it.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good evening. A couple of questions here. First of all, John, can you comment on the discussions, the ongoing discussions with manufacturers on specialty pricing models?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're very excited about the growth in our specialty business overall. We've made significant strides in building out our value proposition for the customers. You heard us talk about oncology in particular, but in several of the specialties, I think we're very well positioned and the business continues to grow at rates that would be at or above market level. So we are well positioned and we're pleased with the array of services that we provide.","Clearly the manufacturer and the customer are both important aspects of driving profitability in that business, and we are continuing to expand the relationships in both directions, and we do believe that the manufacturers benefit significantly by using our services and are willing to pay for those services, because it certainly reduces a lot of the financial and logistics workloads that they have on their laps. So I hesitate to speak universally about a class of customers, but I think our relationships with the manufacturers are very sound and those relationships continue to build.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up question on the numbers, just because of the moving parts here. So first of all, James, was the $0.38 in litigation benefit that you talked about on the Analyst Day, did you assume that it will all be captured in the June quarter?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That was our assumption going into the year. I mentioned back on the January earnings call that it was a single case and that it was quite far along. So that was very much a part of our initial full year guide to you. And then the other thing really just to emphasize is the fact that we also have an anti-trust settlement of substantial scale in Q1 of last fiscal year. So the year-over-year impact from these anti-trust settlements is $83 million versus the much larger figure that we recorded specifically in this Q1.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And when we think about the margin, because obviously for us when we model those operating margin assumptions are important. I think that last year you've given us some guidance there. You haven't this year. So when we think about the quarter, right, in schedule 2, it's 2.28% in Distribution Solutions. If we back out the benefit from that settlement, we get to around I think 2.03%. What should we be using as a base for the remainder of the year?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, just to reemphasize that for the full year, we're expecting the Distribution Solutions operating margin to be in line with that of the prior year. And so yeah, we're obviously off to a stronger start in Q1 because of this anti-trust settlement very much benefiting us in the back quarter, but really the overall story for the year is flat. The other thing I'd just further emphasize again as you think about the first half\/second half split is that we'd expect about 48% of the earnings for McKesson to come in the first half versus the second half.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ricky, we can go back and check our guidance at the beginning of the year, but I believe we did give you a margin guidance. It was in line with what we just said, flat for full year, so.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right, we haven't changed that guide since we initially laid out guidance.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And to make sure that we're all using the same base for 2016, should we use the 2.29% for the year?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's 2.34 percentage points.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So excluding the restructure. Okay.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","And next will be Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America","Thanks. Good afternoon, John and James. Yeah, so I guess for us there's been obviously some discussion in the pharma supply channel this year about lower penetration rates at some of the more recent individual first-time generic launches relative to the brand. Could you just remind us again your observations on that subject and really just specifically, it seems to us that maybe some of those key generics that were in question have now actually achieved some much higher penetration rates with the passage of some additional time this year. Just curious to get your latest thoughts on that subject. Thank you.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of brand to generic conversions, we went into the year believing that we'd see a lower overall profit contribution than had been the case in the prior fiscal year. And obviously, Crestor has been a big launch early in the year, and based on what we've seen there, we don't have any change in our point of view. We would continue to believe that we'll see a lower profit contribution from these brand to generic conversions.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there really isn't much of a change in our past experience based on what we're seeing today. And I think there's the best way to sum it up, Steven.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America","Okay. Well and a quick one just on the cost alignment plan progress. I guess that you've dug deeper into your operations. Have you found any new or additional sources of savings, or is everything about as expected with that whole program?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's moving along as I expected it to, again, at the point where we last talked about our guidance. So no, it's very much on track as expected.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the charges you're seeing or will see this year are charges we anticipated when we launched the program last year. They just had to be recognized when they were realized, and some of them were going to be realized this year. So it's not a new cost alignment plan, it's a continuation of the one that has already been completed and the financial impact of some of those charges rolled into this year.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's right. Some of the charges have to be taken in fiscal 2017 versus the bulk that we took in fiscal 2016.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America","Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And moving on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. John, I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment that you made around the branded manufacturer. I'm just curious, as we think about inventory management agreements on your branded business, I think in the past you've talked about 85% to 90% are under inventory management agreements. Are you seeing any changes in that other 10% to 15% as some of those manufacturers come under pressure to have a more firm relationship with the distributor, or a more defined relationship like some of the larger manufacturers do?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we have not seen much of a change in the big relationships. They remain pretty consistent, and I'd just sort of remind people that even in some of the larger relationships, there is exposure that remains both positive and negative depending on how you look at it relative to their price increase activities. And so when we talk about the year over year change, you can imagine that with that particular manufacturer, we benefited from their previous price increase patterns and in this quarter have benefited to a lesser degree, and that's why we call it out. But if you step back from that specific individual company, we're not really seeing any change to the character of our relationships.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just looking at the technology side of your business coming in better than at least our expectations in the quarter. I'm just wondering if it beat your expectations and if there's anything notable to call out within that business in the quarter?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we ran through some of the drivers. Obviously, we're very pleased with the progress of the results there, very much a focus on the higher margin businesses, very much lower expenses as a result of the cost alignment plan and so forth. But at the same, there are also some timing items that benefited Q1 that I would expect to revert out in Q2. So I'd just temper the situation with that last thought.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And you heard us in our prepared remarks talk about the low 20% type of margin, which is slightly below obviously what we recorded in the first quarter, which is reflective of us going back to a more normal run rate. But I would agree with you that we see the business performing very well, and it sets us up nice as we think about the completion of our transaction with Change Healthcare. And we think customers in particular and investors will benefit significantly from the combination.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And moving on to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So lot of confusion I can sense from my inbox on sort of the implied 2Q guide, and I realize you guys don't typically give a ton of sequential commentary, but I think some of the issue is just sort of off of what base to think about the 48% in the first half. So I just, one, want to make sure we're all talking about the same numbers in terms of which of the two sort of annual forecasts, with or without the CAP we're speaking to, and that we've got clarity. And then, if you could just help us, other than the sequential sort of shift obviously in the anti-trust plus tax, how to think about the progression aside from those two factors.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so the base from which I'm making that 48% first half comment is very much from our guide of $13.43 to $13.93, which is excluding $0.12 to $0.15 of CAP charges. So that's the base from which you should start. In terms of Q1 versus Q2 items, I just mentioned to Lisa the point that I would expect there will be some timing items around the Technology Solutions business. And then obviously, Q1 benefited substantially from the anti-trust settlement, that roughly $0.38 in the quarter, equivalent to a year over year impact of $83 million.","And then in terms of the change in accounting around share-based compensation, as we discussed at Analyst Day, that was going to be $0.16 benefit for Q1. And then only another incremental $0.04 over the balance of the year, so just directionally about a $0.01 or so benefit in Q2. So I think those are the important drivers, if you will, of the Q1\/Q2 split.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Okay, that was helpful. And maybe just quickly for John, was there anything in either of the two lead candidates for president, the platforms, that you thought was sort of notably relevant for the business? I mean obviously more recently, a lot of was made on Part B and a few other things. But I'm curious if anything stuck out to you that was notable?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the thing that's most notable is that in both platforms, you hear a discussion about cost and quality at some level. And clearly we believe the healthcare industry is headed on a continued improvement front on both of those dimensions. We need to take cost out of the healthcare system, and we need better visibility to quality, and people are increasingly going to be paid in a way that reflects the value they deliver on those two dimensions.","So I think regardless of the candidate that wins, or the party platform that gets adopted, we're trying to help our customers prepare for that environment of more cost pressure, and more inspection of their ability to deliver value. And part of that is also going to require them to collaborate and connect across the boundaries of their individual businesses. So I would say that that theme is the thing that stuck out the most, is that I think the issues that have been raised in the previous administration around these issues, or I should say the interest raised around these issues in the previous administration will continue.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And next question will come from David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk about your ability to move share with biosimilars please and how that may differ from some of your competitors? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well we're pleased with our position in specialties. I mentioned it a few moments ago, and I think that our business has continued to focus heavily on our ability to add value to our customers and deliver through our scale and knowledge a product at an improved value. Clearly, biosimilars produce an opportunity for us to reduce cost and deliver quality to our customers, and in places where we can influence the selection of the biosimilar, we believe we will benefit and our customers will benefit.","Clearly part of the challenge biosimilars face in the market is their ability to prove the equivalence of their product compared to the originator. And we think in particular, our US Oncology Network is prepared to work with manufacturers to do the type of work that will be necessary, not only to prove to us that the product produces a similar result at a lower cost, but also provide a beachhead or a benchmark from which other customers can be convinced given the rigor and discipline that our network uses to evaluate these types of opportunities.","So I think in some categories we may not have much influence, but clearly in products that are used in clinics or in oncology practices in particular, we're very well positioned to create value for the manufacturers and as a result deliver value to our customers through that relationship with the manufacturers.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, and then regarding Omnicare, Optum and Target, we're completely through all of those as of this quarter. Is that correct?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I wouldn't put it that way. I think it's important to note that the year over year headwinds from both generic pricing effects and customer consolidation, the cash grow you're just referring to are very much weighted to our first half of the fiscal year. So once we get into the second half, they're significantly less, but they're very relevant in the first half of fiscal 2017 year over year.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. John, you mentioned the change in reimbursement in the UK. Any chance you could give us a sense or quantify the headwind that that creates in fiscal 2017 versus your previous expectations? And then within international, I know the original guidance was for low double digit constant currency revenue growth. Does that still hold true in light of these reimbursement changes?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I'll let (50:19) first question a little bit. The second question you may have to repeat so I make sure I fully understand what it was. On the first one, I think that the second change the UK \u2013 the first change we understood and we saw it coming, and we had prepared our organization to make moves to offset it and to grow through it. And I think the second change was almost equal in its magnitude related to the first change, which was not insignificant, and so the second change is going to be more problematic for us. And that's I think what we're preparing to deal with as we go through this fiscal year.","If you step back from those two issues, the Celesio businesses are performing quite well, and in fact, we're making progress in almost every country to improve our market position, our operational efficiency, getting our product service levels up and so on, the technology that's necessary to support the business including moving into areas hopefully like specialty and the hospital business, et cetera, over time. So I think we're quite pleased with the progress of the businesses. I think that the second hit in the UK was not anticipated, and frankly will be a little bit of a headwind for that business this year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, and I guess just, John, to the follow-up on that specifically was just previously you guys had talked about low double digit constant currency revenue growth in the international business. I was asking in light of this second reimbursement hit, does that expectation still hold true for the international business's revenue growth?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The significant driver of that double digit revenue guide is really the effect of the acquisitions that we closed a number of them in Q1. We have others yet to close, including the Sainsbury's transaction for example. So really that will be the driver of our ability to execute against that double digit guide.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So it's probably fair to say that the cuts in the UK are not a significant impact on the revenue side of Celesio. So we'd expect those earlier forecasts to hold. It's more of an issue to earnings in that business than it is revenue.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's right.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And moving on to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon guys, and thanks for taking the questions. James, I think if we think about the gross margin pressure, the gross margin erosion, if you were to just kind of bucket it by order of magnitude if we think about the tough comps on generics, how much of it is mix, brand versus generic versus specialty? And how much of it is just kind of the changing of the business mix given the M&A that's going on, I guess? How should we think about kind of the leading drivers of generic pressure, I'm sorry, of margin pressure?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, if you think about the gross profit margin, I would really point you back to the impact on a year over year basis, the impact of generic price increase activity and the customer consolidation issue, particularly on the Care and the Target pharmacies. That's really the most significant pairing that's driving the gross profit margin line. And then the other thing that we've spoken about this afternoon is that branded manufacturer, and the compensation that we happen to have driven from them in this particular quarter.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Compared to prior year.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, I guess then maybe if I step back and I back all this out, if I back out the items in Q1 of last year, and the items of Q1 of this year, would gross margin actually have been up, ex the generic drug pricing impact? Like would margins have actually expanded?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I would say the effect of those customer consolidations had a significant impact on the gross profit line in Q1, and again that factor and the generic pricing increase factor will be significant in the first half of our fiscal year, so in Q 2 as well.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, and maybe just last quick follow-up. John, I know it's early in the process, but any interest in EIS yet, and has that process kind of started to get rolling yet? Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably too early to talk about EIS. Clearly, we're focused on making sure we maintain that customer base and continue to develop the product and retain the people, and as we have news to update you guys on, we'll certainly bring it to you.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And we have a question from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Thanks guys. So just going back to Ross's question, because we're definitely getting pinged as well here. So, I just want to make sure we're kind of all on the same page as we think about \u2013 so if we kind of use $3.17 in 2Q of last year, just backing out the benefits from ZEE Medical, and what the implied is for the second quarter, it looks like potentially down year on-year just in terms of earnings growth in 2Q. Is that just kind of the remainder of the residual impact from this negative comp, if you will, and generic pricing and then we kind of start to lap that to some degree as we get into the third and the fourth quarter? Is that kind of another way to think about it as well?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, actually yeah. I'd just emphasize again, the impact in both Q1 and we expect in Q2 of the twin effects of the generic pricing environment, the lack of price increases relative to the prior year, and the effect for us of the move of Omnicare and Target away from us. So those are both going to be significant drivers in both Q1 and Q2.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, James.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well thank you, Justin, for helping us out today, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported second quarter total company revenues of $57.6 billion. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.60, which was in line with our expectations, and when excluding the $0.33 prior year benefit from the reversal of a contractual liability associated with McKesson's investment in Change Healthcare, second quarter results per diluted share increased more than 10% year-over-year.","Our first half fiscal 2020 results give us confidence in our reaffirmed fiscal 2020 full-year outlook of $14 to $14.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share. This continues to reflect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth in each of our segments.","Before I go deeper into our second quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to discuss one topic I know is top of mind for everyone and that is opioid litigation. Last week, McKesson along with two other distributors, reached a collective $215 million settlement with two Ohio Counties, Cuyahoga and Summit in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation.","McKesson's portion of the settlement was $82 million which was recorded in our second quarter results. We strongly dispute the allegations made by these two counties. However, settling the bellwether trial was in our view an important stepping stone to achieving a broad resolution to opioid litigation and to accelerating relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis.","Over the next few months, we will be working hard with other parties on the settlement framework that includes States and their subdivisions. While we have made good progress, there are many details and variables that remain open and still needs to be addressed. We are optimistic that a broad resolution can be achieved and that remains our goal. All along, we've said the goal is to ring-fence the risk.","However, to the extent the broad resolution settlement framework is unsuccessful; McKesson is prepared and continues to be prepared to litigate and to vigorously defend the mischaracterization that our company drove demand for opioids in this country. The litigation process if necessary will be costly and can take many years to conclude causing a significant and substantial delay to crisis mitigation efforts.","I've stated this before, McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis. And while I appreciate there are many, many questions on this topic, given that discussions are ongoing, we will be somewhat limited in what we can say, and I'm sure you can appreciate this, and we thank you for your understanding. I also want to provide a brief update on our Board of Directors.","In mid-October, our Board of Directors welcomed Maria Martinez as a new Independent Director. Maria has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer for Cisco since April, 2018. She brings deep experience in customer experience, technology and innovation, which we look forward to benefiting from. Maria's appointment, in addition to Ken Washington joining our Board of Directors in July, demonstrates our continuing commitment to refresh our Board and add valuable expertise and new perspectives.","Now let's get to the business results and share why I am so confident in McKesson's positioning and our outlook. If you step back from a macro perspective, trends continue to support growth in healthcare. We have an aging population as well as increase in chronic conditions. We are also seeing growth in innovative specialty medicines. The pipeline is rich with such medicines, including biosimilars.","Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reflected solid execution in the quarter against this macro backdrop. Branded pricing is tracking in line with our fiscal 2020 assumption of mid-single-digit price increases. For generics, consistent with prior quarters, our ClarusONE Sourcing venture is performing in line with expectations and the sell-side remains competitive, but stable. Independent pharmacies continue to demonstrate resiliency and remain an important customer of McKesson.","Recently our McKesson RxOwnership team partnered with the National Community Pharmacist Association to sponsor it's 10th annual Ownership Workshops Series. RxOwnership supports the future of pharmacy ownership by giving pharmacists the knowledge, the support, and the tools required to achieve their ownership goals. In the past year, RXOwnership assisted more than 725 owners in launching a new pharmacy and since 2008, our team aided in the ownership or transfer process of roughly 6,000 community pharmacies.","We are proud of the long-term investments we've made in helping independent pharmacies deliver exceptional care to their patients and communities. I am also pleased with the strength we continue to see from our Specialty businesses where we have a broad array of assets and capabilities.","When I talk about our Specialty businesses, I'm largely referring to our Provider Solutions and Practice Management businesses that serve the community setting, primarily in oncology, but also in other ologies like ophthalmology, rheumatology and neurology, and our life sciences business that leverage our provider footprint and differentiated services to drive solutions upstream for our manufacturer partners.","These businesses are organized in three strategic areas. First, Provider Solutions which is the largest of the three businesses, includes the distribution and GPO services that are core to McKesson and to the needs of our physician customers. Also in this business, we have technology and tools that enhance value-based care delivery and products and services to help expand practice revenue.","Next is the practice management business. We discussed the U.S. Oncology Network quite often. This organization supports more than 1,400 physicians across 450 sites of service. We provide a unique value proposition which allows the physician to remain independent, while utilizing McKesson services and staff to ensure the practice is running efficiently and effectively. This allows the physician to focus his or her time on treating patients.","McKesson has 15 practices in the U.S. Oncology Network that are participating in the Oncology Care Model or OCM. The centers for Medicaid and Medicaid innovation recently released results for the fourth performance period related to the OCM.","I'm pleased to report that all 15 practices earn high marks for quality performance. The practices improved care and provided an enhanced patient experience and also saved Medicare approximately $35 million during the performance period as compared to the established benchmark.","We are committed to ensuring that community practices have access to all the resources necessary, including access to clinical trials to successfully accomplish the challenging practice transformation required by the OCM and the other value-based alternative payment models.","The third business is our McKesson life sciences business. This business includes third party logistics, specialty pharmacy solutions for oncology and other rare and orphan products, patient access, adherence and affordability solutions, clinical education services, and a suite of data services providing commercial insights and real world evidence. These services help ensure biopharma manufacturers are successful in the post-launch commercialization of their products.","These three businesses are well-positioned as innovative specialty products, including biosimilars are coming to the market and McKesson is often the partner of choice throughout the lifecycle of a therapy. As you can see, two of our strategic imperatives, supporting specialty and the manufacturer services value proposition are underpinned by the strong portfolio of our existing offerings.","And we consistently look at ways to expand those offerings and create new value-added services for our customers. We are investing in these businesses, specifically in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We're making these investments in order to further expand our capabilities and support our future growth.","Let me turn now to Europe. As a reminder, last quarter in our UK Retail business, we experienced industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. Consistent with our expectations in July, we did see a nominal tariff increase in the month of August. And we do expect a further upward tariff revision later this fiscal year, which should result in a partial recovery of the underfunding we've experienced year-to-date.","Outside of the UK, in Europe, we continue to see in aggregate year-to-date performance in line with our expectations for that segment. Britt will discuss our full-year outlook for the segment in a few minutes. A few words on our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to see above market growth as we operate in strong markets and care shifts out of the hospital to alternate sites of care.","McKesson has a full range of products and services for our physician, health system, post-acute and home care provider customers. So we can serve their needs comprehensively and our customer benefit from our enterprise mindset as our MedSurg team partners closely with our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business to ensure physicians received the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practices. This continues to be an area of growth for our business. And the MSD acquisition, which we fully lapped in the first quarter, is on track with its plan integration as we worked to consolidate the business and position ourselves to effectively scale.","Turning to the other segment, which primarily consist of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our investment in Change Healthcare. As we evaluate ways to further leverage the scale and expertise of our businesses. In Canada, we've recently streamlined our leadership team structure into a retail and wholesale operations focus.","We've introduced two new Senior Vice President Physicians responsible for leading the core operating businesses of retail, which includes digital and loyalty programs and our distribution solutions and specialty health business in Canada. This strategic change will enable our Canadian operations to work even better together as we deepen relationships with manufacturers and retail partners and drive real value for patients. I believe we have the right talent to move the Company forward and contribute to a better healthcare system for all Canadians.","Moving on to MRxTS. The business continues to show strong growth in both new and existing products. In addition, our CoverMyMeds business, which is focused on electronic prior authorization, continues to innovate across the organization. During the quarter, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads by McKesson announced the launch of AMP, which stands for Access for More Patients, a first-in-class technology driven patient support solution that transforms how patients access afford and adhere to their medications.","This collaboration brings together the robust technology platform and established provider network of CoverMyMeds with the deep specialty experience and commercialization expertise of RxCrossroads by McKesson and is designed to automate access to specialty medications for physicians and patients.","The traditional hub model has had complex requirements and in many times relied on time consuming manual processes, which typically delay treatment sometimes significantly. In our pilot case study, McKesson's AMP solution enabled patients across the U.S. to access their specialty medications 27% faster than traditional hub programs. Fundamentally improving the way patient support is provided.","AMP also provides high-touch services for patient cases that need intervention support beyond the automated technology platform, such as proactive clinical support, behavioral coaching and financial assistance, improving adherence and helping to support better outcomes for patients.","We're very excited about this cross collaboration as it again exemplifies our mission to improve patient care by providing innovative offerings and demonstrates the value of our McKesson team and our broad set of capabilities. This represents another example of how we're investing in our differentiated businesses.","Let's move on to Change Healthcare. Our value-creating transaction with Change Healthcare provided McKesson with a cash payment upfront that allowed us to retain 70% ownership of the new company. It created a scaled healthcare, software and analytics, and technology enabled services company that will unlock the value of our legacy MTS businesses.","We have begun activities to exit the investment in the next 6 months to 12 months in a tax efficient manner. This drove certain charges that impacted our results for the second quarter. Britt will walk you through these accounting details later in the call.","In the Change Healthcare transaction, we found a way to create value while exiting businesses that weren't core to our McKesson strategy. It's a great example of how McKesson regularly evaluates our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of assets for the present, but also for the future.","I'm very pleased by the execution across our businesses in the second quarter. That execution included the impact of our cost savings initiatives across the enterprise. Britt will get into more of the details, but I think from my remarks you can see evidence of not only the savings efforts, but the partnership across the businesses and overall cultural change happening across the organization.","For example, we centralize our IT organization, implementing a center-led hub model to increase efficiency. In MedSurg, I talked about the partnership with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment to ensure physicians receive the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practice in an easy way. And in MRxTS, I talked about the partnership with RxCrossroads business to launch AMP.","Overall, we're evolving behaviors as it relates to company collaboration and spending and are focused on moving with speed in an ever-changing healthcare landscape. We're building upon our strong culture, leveraging our diverse perspective to make decisions with an enterprise first team McKesson mindset. I feel confident in the execution I've seen across our businesses in the first half of fiscal 2020 and I feel great about the future of McKesson.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Britt to go over the financials and some of the details I alluded to. Britt?","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'll begin with a few comments in second quarter results, including changes to our guidance for you to consider as you update your models. We were pleased with our adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter, which were in line with consensus and grew 10% over the prior year when excluding a one-time $90 million benefit in FY 2019.","Our performance to the first half of fiscal 2020 was solid, and we are pleased with the momentum across the business and we're reiterating our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share. Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our second quarter earnings slides posted to the investors section of our website. Before we get into the details of the results, I want to address two items that impacted our GAAP only results.","First, we've concluded it\u2019s the appropriate time to exit our remaining stake in Change Healthcare and we begun activities expected to lead to an exited the investment, which we anticipate will occur within the next 6 months to 12 months. As we previously communicated, we will execute this transaction in a tax efficient manner and we expect that this transaction will continue to deliver value to McKesson's shareholders.","We believe that this transaction better positions McKesson to focused on its core set of businesses. As part of this work, we completed a market value assessment and recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion in our fiscal 2020 second quarter. It's important to note this charge in no way reflects the future value of Change Healthcare.","Rather, it's an adjustment of the book value to the current market value from one of the necessary accounting activities within the planned exit process. Overall, the Change Healthcare transaction has been and continues to be value creating from McKesson's shareholders.","Second, as Brian mentioned earlier, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $82 million after settling all claims against McKesson and the suits filed by Cuyahoga and Summit counties of Ohio in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation.","Moving to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter. On Slide 3 of the presentation, our second quarter adjusted earnings of $3.60 per diluted share was flat year-over-year. As a reminder in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, McKesson recorded a $90 million or $0.33 per diluted share pretax benefit related to the reversal of contractual liability associated with our investment in Change Healthcare.","Excluding this one-time item, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10% driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical and Prescription Technology or MRxTS businesses. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.91, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Excluding the previously mentioned one-time benefit in FY2019, year-to-date adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 12% year-over-year.","Moving to the details of our consolidated results on Slide 4. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 9% year-over-year, due to higher than anticipated growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment in part related to increase Caremark volumes associated with the on-boarding of a new customer.","Taking this into account, we are updating our consolidated revenues guidance from low-to-mid single-digit growth to mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth year-over-year.","Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year or 3% on an FX adjusted basis, mainly driven by strong Primary Care pharmaceutical volumes within our Medical-Surgical segment, continued growth in our Specialty Providers Solutions business within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment, and growth across our existing MRxTS offerings, principally within our electronic prior authorization products.","Second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year. Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, operating expenses increased 2.5% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.","Adjusted income from operations before tax was $859 million for the quarter, 6% below the prior year. However, excluding the one-time prior year $90 million benefit, adjusted income from operations before tax increased 4%.","Interest expense was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, which included discrete tax benefits of approximately $31 million, and we continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize in the back half of the fiscal year.","During the quarter, we completed $750 million of share repurchases and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding were $184 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. As a result of share repurchase activity this year, we're updating our guidance to diluted weighted-average shares of approximately $184 million for the year.","Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Slides 6 through 9. I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $46 billion, up 10% year-over-year driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and the previously mentioned increase in Caremark volumes, which were largely specialty products and were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Based on the revenue development in the first half of the fiscal year, we are updating our guidance to revenue growth of high single-digits.","Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 1% year-over-year to $641 million due to continued growth in our Specialty businesses led by the Provider Solutions business, partially offset by customer and product mix, which includes the new customer volumes that are flowing through Caremark. Year-to-date, segment adjusted operating profit growth is 6%.","As Brian discussed, we have differentiated assets and capabilities in the areas of oncology and manufacturer services. As such, we will be investing an incremental $25 million in the second half of the year to extend these leading positions. Inclusive of these additional investments, we are reiterating our adjusted operating profit guidance of low-to-mid single-digit percent growth for the full-year.","Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were down 1% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 4% in line with our original expectations, driven by market growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business.","Segment adjusted operating profit was down 23% to $41 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $43 million, down 19% due to continued weakness in the UK retail pharmacy environment.","As Brian mentioned, we are expecting partial recovery of the underfunding we experienced year-to-date by the NHS, and while we continue to anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020, we are however, updating our full-year guidance for Europe. Our updated revenue guidance is flat to low single-digit percentage decline and adjusted operating profit growth in the low single-digits.","Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year driven by growth in pharmaceutical volumes within our Primary Care business. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 20% to $166 million, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned organic growth and the lapping of $8 million of bad debt expense in the prior year.","The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 807 basis points an increase of 99 basis points, driven by organic growth and lapping of prior year bad debt expense.","And finishing our business review with Other revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 4% year-over-year due to organic growth in the Canadian Wholesale business and higher volumes of our prior authorization products within the Prescription Technology or MRxTS business.","Our original revenue guidance for Other, reflected the anticipated exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business at the onset of the fiscal year. This transition has been delayed and as a result, we are updating revenue guidance for Other to grow low single-digits in fiscal 2020.","Other adjusted operating profit decreased 26% to $221 million driven by the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal and lower contribution from our investment and Change Healthcare, partially offset by higher transaction volumes in our MRxTS business, principally from our electronic prior authorization products and growth in our Canadian Wholesale business.","Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, Other adjusted operating profit grew 5% versus the prior year. And we continue to expect adjusted operating profits to be down low-to-mid single-digits.","Year-to-date, our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $147 million and we continue to anticipate the adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million.","Moving now to corporate expenses. McKesson recorded a $146 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the second quarter, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year, resulting from planned investments in technology.","McKesson recorded $36 million in opioid-related litigation expenses in the second quarter and $72 million year-to-date. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs to be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020.","Based on the progress against our cost initiative program and the anticipated timing of planned technology investments, we are updating our corporate expense guidance through range of $695 million to $745 million for the year.","Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. For the first half of fiscal 2020, McKesson used a $159 million in cash flow from operations. We used $184 million for internal capital investment, resulting in negative free cash flow of $343 million.","For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid $95 million per acquisition and we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of $1.4 billion in common stock and payment of $148 million in dividends.","Finally, I would remind you that our working capital metrics and results in cash flow maybe impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. I would also remind you we typically generate the majority of our annual operating cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year with more than $3 billion generated in each of the past two years.","In fiscal 2020, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $500 million and $700 million and free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment is committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which underpins our financial flexibility and delivering value and returns to our shareholders.","Before I wrap up, we are updating our guidance around the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement to a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. And in terms of fiscal 2020 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution similar to prior years and the first half earnings progression is compared to the second half will be similar to FY2019.","Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. Our cost program is called [Venn Smart]. This emphasizes that everyone in the organization must think like an owner and that we will leverage the scale of the enterprise. We are seeing good progress in reducing costs via competitive and lean operator.","As we've stated previously, we expected a portion of these savings will flow through profit, as evidenced by our lower corporate expense guide and overall operating expense results, and a portion will be reinvested in growth, such as the investments I discussed earlier in oncology, in manufacturer services.","Additionally, we are on track to successfully transition several business unit functional and back office services to a more centralized hub model, allowing us to further increase standardization, gain efficiencies and drive focus to our customers. We've already made great progress in transforming finance and IT and we've seen tangible results from our investments in technology, more specifically data and analytics, and we're confident that our focus in this area will unlock additional benefits. The collective efforts and focus of our associates across the enterprise have resulted in meaningful savings for the organization.","In closing, we are encouraged by the continued positive momentum across our businesses through the first half of fiscal 2020, led by the focus and execution of our associates across the enterprise. As a result, we are reiterating our fiscal 2020 outlook of adjusted earnings per diluted share of $14 to $14.60.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interested time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Maybe to begin, it's hard to disaggregate the underlying gross margin trend and for pharma in particular given what has gone on in the EU. Can you give us some perspective on what gross margin is doing and maybe gross margin and absolute gross profit?","Britt Vitalone","Yes. Hey Eric. Thanks for that question. As we talked about, we had significant growth in revenues in the quarter. And as I mentioned, specifically in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, we had growth that caused us to raise our guidance for the full-year. And I also pointed to the fact that a great portion of that came from specialty products and in particular from the growth of Caremark through growth of new customers there. And that had an impact on our gross profit rate in terms of comparing that to our revenue growth.","We did have a 1% impact from foreign exchange. So when you looked at our gross profit, 3% when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. But I would point you back to the fact that our revenue grew faster than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. It's largely coming from the onboarding of some customer wins through Caremark and there's a customer and product mix aspect to that where the products are largely coming through specialty products. And that's really what's driving that delta between revenue growth and gross profit growth.","Eric Percher","In an absolute basis, you're seeing growth from specialty and is it also reasonable to expect that given the stability you speak to in the generic marketplace and given sourcing that we're seeing generic profitability grow on an absolute basis?","Britt Vitalone","Yes. Eric, we are seeing that. As Brian talked about, we continue to see great benefits coming from our ClarusONE Sourcing organization. We're able to generate a good savings there this year. We're seeing stability on the sell-side and that's allowing us to continue to create a spread from a generic perspective.","In our Specialty businesses, Brian, I think talked a lot about our provider business, our advances that we have in manufacturer services, and the lead that we have in from a U.S. Oncology as an asset. But we're seeing a lot of growth that is coming through our full line wholesale distribution. And as I mentioned, that's particularly coming from the growth of large customers like Caremark.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I just wanted to go back to your comments around the opioid litigation and settlement. If I do the math, 38% of the settlement was McKesson. Should I think about that that was the market share in those two counties, or do you anticipate just given your overall market share with the independence in the U.S. that if we think about any settlement, it would be, somewhere in that type of range on a percentage basis?","Brian Tyler","Good morning, Lisa. Thank you for the question. You did your math correct. We were 38% of that settlement. Obviously, there is data in the marketplace, the ARCOS data in particular that many of you are aware and familiar with. That data can be cut lots of ways depending on how you look at time periods, and how you look at customer segments, and whether you consider doses, et cetera, et cetera. And so part of the discussions that we had to go through was a methodology and we landed on a data-based methodology, and so you can roughly think of 38% as the McKesson representation of \u201cour share\u201d.","Lisa Gill","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as we think about the timeline of this. I know you said that you're prepared to defend and litigate if needed. My understanding is that the next court cases until some time next summer. So does that mean that that kind of gives you this time between now and then for a settlement? And any update that you can give us on where you are on a potential global settlement? Because if I remember correctly, I think that's what you've talked about in the past, right. Ring-fencing those and having a global settlement not doing these one-off\u2026","Brian Tyler","Yes. That's right. Thank you, Lisa. I mean our objective and priority continues to be, we'll call it, sometimes global resolution or ring-fencing and that remains our priority. Our view on these two counties and coming to the settlement agreement we did with them was that that was an important stepping stone or building block or momentum for those, for the more global discussions to progress.","And so we're encouraged by the status of the discussions. There is a lot of activity and things that we need to continue to work through, and we are actively working through those. We're working through those with some urgency. But it will take a bit of time to get through those. We're talking about 50 States and we're talking about subdivisions within States.","So we've got a framework that we're very optimistic about. The teams are working diligently to address the issues. We'll progress it as quickly as we can, but obviously, we contemplate the two paths we've always talked about. There's a path to litigate, which only can project amount of time and amount of dollars to go down that path. And then there is a path that we think ring-fence is a risk and give us other resolution that it will take the path that we think is most beneficial for our shareholders.","We certainly are anxious to find a resolution that takes care of the patients in the communities they serve as quickly as they can. But as we pursue these discussions, we continue to invest in our defense and we think it's only prudent to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Brian, just as I think about your comments about the trends that you saw with the medical side on the primary care physician offices and new supply, how are you strategizing? Or how are you thinking about the emergence of retail-based client care delivery in the primary care side, whether that's Walmart who's your client obviously, or the competitors in the retail space?","Brian Tyler","Yes. Great. Thank you for the question. Maybe to frame it my answer a little bit, I'll go back in time. I think the medical business has been very successful at following the emergence of new channels in the alternate site settings. At one point in time that was urgent care clinics. We have a large footprint in the retail-based clinics that are out there today.","And so we think as these new models for community-based care emerge, the solutions that we have in the medical business are right on point for the needs that those businesses and services will have. So my view is that's just a continued evolution in a new segment and our team has proven quite adept and quite effective at evolving our capabilities, and really leading the way as these segments emerge. And I would expect that's what the team is focused on today.","Brian Tanquilut","And then I guess just my follow-up for Britt. As I think about calendar 2020, is there \u2013 what are your expectations in terms of brand pricing, just for 1-1?","Britt Vitalone","Yes. What I would say is that we're reiterating our view that brand price inflations mid single-digit. We don't see anything that has occurred on the first half of the year or this quarter that would change that expectation. So we're continuing to view brand price \u2013 in the mid single-digits. Obviously, January is a usually an important month historically. But at this point, we're not changing our view on branded price inflation.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Baxter","Hi. Thanks for the question. So I'm trying to understand the magnitude of the revenue revision in the U.S. Pharma business. Now I appreciate the color on Caremark, but it sounds like you're suggesting this is coming in a lot better than expected levels. So I guess first, can you help us understand why that is?","And then I guess the follow-up will be you're raising revenue guidance here by what looks like roughly 3% to 5%, but not changing your EBIT growth outlook. I get that we're talking about specialty and Caremark, but surprising there isn't really any noticeable drop due to earn ins. So, I guess how should we be thinking about that and is there something about the rest of the business, we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes. Thanks for that question. So let me just step back to the revenue guidance. Our prior revenue guidance was low single-digit to mid single-digit. And so we've updated that to high single-digit, and that's largely reflective of the growth that we're seeing that's coming from Caremark and particularly, Specialty products that are going through that customer. That's really what's driving this.","In terms of the drop due to the bottom line. We're really pleased that we're able to make investments in the business. I talked about $25 million of investments in our oncology and manufacturer services capabilities. And despite those investments, we're pleased to be able to hold and then affirm our guidance for the segment on AOP at that low single- to mid single-digit number.","So I would call this as a growth from one of our customers that is primarily coming through Specialty. We're making investments where we have leading positions and great capabilities and I talked about that as being an additional $25 million, but we're still holding and affirming the AOP guide or the segment.","Stephen Baxter","Got it. And I guess just coming back to \u2013 like what is better than was expected going into the year? Is there any clarity you can provide on that? I appreciate what the driver is in absolute terms, but understanding what is prior expectation would be great? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Sure. Well, I'd just reiterate a couple things that branded price inflation is performing as we had anticipated. We're seeing really good progress out of ClarusONE and so our \u2013 from a generic perspective, everything is performing as we had anticipated, still stable competitive marketplace.","I think a couple of things that I would point out that Brian really talked about is our Specialty Provider business is performing quite well. And certainly the investments that we've been making in our manufacturer services capabilities and that we're continuing to make there, that\u2019s also performing well.","So I think as you think about our Specialty business, we're getting a lot of growth through customer wins in our Wholesale Distribution business. We're making great advances in our Provider business and our manufacturer services capabilities.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to the comment you made, Brian, about the stability of what you're seeing on the sell side relative to generics. And now it's been about three years since we had a shift in the independent market, you also highlighted some of the value that you provide in terms of the independent customers. And so I guess as we go forward, how do you think about the activity and the kind of \u2013 the puts and takes that go on with the independent market, and how they think about negotiating, especially as they all tend to get into their own specific buying groups?","Brian Tyler","Yes, sure. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I mean I referenced in my comments the RxOwnership program and the fact that 700-ish pharmacy \u2013 new pharmacy owners, we helped in opening or establishing or transferring into the business.","And that's not a unusual number. I mean if you go back many, many years, we often see lots of exits, in the Independent Pharmacy segment. Some of those are family planning and transition exit. Some are script file sales, but we also see as many new \u2013 as many new openings or many new storefronts come into play. And so it's been remarkably stable over the years. And that trend we continue to see today.","And we do, over the years we have and we continue to invest in these tools and these services that we think help independent pharmacists stay independent, stay healthy businesses and stay vibrant in the communities and the patients that we serve. But we really haven't seen anything that I would say was a massive trend break in terms of there's always ins and there's always outs in the Independent segment.","Michael Cherny","Thanks. And then just one quick question on capital deployments, as you think about the discussions and debates going on relative to the push for a global settlement? Does that have any impact on your cash availability or capital deployment priorities? And I know not from a reserving perspective per say, but do you think about keeping some level of cash to present itself for any type of potential settlements?","Brian Tyler","I would say this. I think we've been pretty clear on what our capital deployment philosophy has been in the past, a very balanced approach to that. What I would say is we have not made a change to that for that portfolio approach. We continue to make investments internally that we think will drive future growth. We continue to be open to M&A, where we can find that the M&A that makes sense, balancing obviously valuation expectations, where our share prices, what alternate returns of that capital are. But that was a long answer to give you the short answer that we really \u2013 it really has not impacted our approach to capital deployment.","Britt Vitalone","And I think if you look at how we've deployed capital in the first half of the year, it's pretty historical amount of capital that's been deployed. We've returned a lot of capital to our shareholders, particularly in the second quarter. And as Brian mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate, really on a balanced perspective. But we haven't made any changes to the amount or how we're deploying capital at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Hey, thanks for getting the questions. So I just wanted to go back, Brian, about the framework here. You're optimistic about in terms of getting sort of more global kind of settlement here. Just to clarify, with this any kind of discussions, is it clear to you that you\u2019ve encompass all point us you might have mentioned, I just didn't catch that clearly.","Brian Tyler","You were breaking up a little bit. Let me \u2013 I think the question was, coming back to the framework, is it going to be all encompassing of all the litigation. And what I would say is that relative to the States and relative to the subdivisions in those States, our goal is to get as comprehensive of a settlement within that framework as we can. And that is the majority of the outstanding litigation. But it is not all of the cases.","Charles Rhyee","Is that something mechanically that, you kind of reach this framework and then wait for all the parties to then look at it and say, we're okay with this. And that sort of \u2013 and if there's some type of from your standpoint and you kind of look at them and thanks. This is enough that we will move forward or not enough and we will not agree to this because it's maybe you might have thought, some large percentage, we're okay with that. But in the end, a lot of them subdivisions say, this is not \u2013 we're not satisfied with this. And in this case you go to the - different tracks?","Brian Tyler","Yes. So I guess that the easiest way to answer that is to say that, this is a complex legal situation. We have established a framework and had good discussion around that framework. It is very much a process though, and we are very much working through the details of how that process will unfold. And it's really not a lot more I can add to it at this time.","Charles Rhyee","Okay. Very good. And Britt, just a follow-up one real quick question on the European segment from the guidance. Is it that you\u2019re still looking for operating profit guidance to low single-digit and really size heavy back half maybe a little bit more thoughts on what's going to get there in the back half? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, thanks for the question. I think as we've talked about, we expect that the business will continue to improve its performance in the back half, and then Brian also talked about some nominal increases in the tariffs in the UK. And we would expect that there could be additional increases in the back half of the year. So that's really what is driving that second half performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question here. So I guess this has been touched on a little bit, I guess I'm looking for any update on the ClarusONE progress and tied into that, based on a little bit of the margin compression in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty business, should we assume that the relationship between the procurement price on generics versus your sell-side pricing, it may have fallen off a little bit during the quarter or in your mind, was that relationship still relatively consistent during the quarter? Thanks.","Brian Tyler","Yes. Thanks for that question. We're really pleased with the performance of ClarusONE and it's performing in line with what our expectations were at the beginning of the year. We're continuing to see that organization drive great value, which is very helpful.","As we think about the sell-side, which is \u2013 as we've talked about now for several quarters. So competitive, but stable environment. We're pleased with ClarusONE. It\u2019s performing as we had anticipated. We think that there's still great value to be gained out of that organization. And we were pleased with the partnership that we have with our partner Walmart as we continue through \u2013 in that relationship as well.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. And what about the relationship then between the buy-side versus the sell-side pricing? Was that consistent during the quarter or was there some slight erosion? Just curious to \u2013 just a high level comment on that.","Brian Tyler","Yes, sure. No, I say it's consistent. We're seeing consistency over the last several quarters now and again, a good performance on ClarusONE in a stable competitive environment on the sell-side, and that's in line with our expectations and what we've seen now for the several quarters.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just a couple to go back to Specialty, Brian, if I could. You discussed the three main areas within Specialty, it sounds like generally very pleased with the performance across the board there. And I think most of us get the mixed dynamic that you guys have discussed within Specialty Pharmacy and Caremark, specifically.","But I guess if we take a step back, the operating profit for the overall Pharma and Specialty segment was up 1% in the quarter. Just sounds like there's a lot of secular tailwinds there. So I guess just wondering if you could shed a little bit more light on how you think about overall EBIT growth as it relates specifically to what seems like some pretty strong tailwinds within specialty?","Brian Tyler","Yes. Great. Thank you. And we reflected on the questions we've had over the last few quarters and that's why we included a little more description or color on the Specialty businesses that we have in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.","And if you think about the three segments we highlighted, they are all performing very well. And we think in all cases, we have assets that are not only competitive with the market, but probably one of the most robust set of solutions and services when taken in the aggregate. And so those businesses are continuing to perform well. They're delivering good growth and they're performing right in line with where we thought they would for the year.","Obviously, there is another segment in specialty that is the more retail mail order oriented specialty products. And Britt talked a lot about the impact we've seen of the growth in the Caremark book of business that has been \u2013 the mix has been slanted towards those specialty products, which tends to be the lower margin profile for us. So when you net all out, that's where you get \u2013 that's how you get to the results that you're seeing today.","Robert Jones","And then I guess just to follow-up on that, maybe Britt. I mean, just to maybe understand that a little bit better. I mean these kind of outsized growth within Caremark products. I mean these aren't margin or EBID dilutive I guess I would say. And then just on the $25 million investment that you mentioned in the back half, maybe just a little bit more specificity around what area within specialty those would be pointed out would be helpful too. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, as we've talked about before and as we think about specialty distribution in our wholesale \u2013 line of wholesale business, they do have a dilutive impact on the rate. We still participate in the profit dollars. It's just grown a lot faster than we had anticipated and that's at a much more dilutive impact on the rate of growth.","As we think about the investments that we're making as Brian talked about, we are very pleased with our positions in oncology, our positions that we're developing in manufacturer services, and as we think about this $25 million, it will be largely invested in oncology capabilities and assets.","But again, we're continuing to invest in our manufacturing services capabilities as well. But you should think about this investment as investing where we have leading-edge positions and oncology is certainly one of those.","Brian Tyler","Yes. Just to build on that. I mean, these investments are tied to our strategy. Our strategy is anchored and where we typically \u2013 we have differentiated capabilities and we have good marketplace growth. And so we're very happy to be able to say we're continuing to make these investments and still delivering on the year as we committed.","Holly Weiss","Operator, we have time for one more.","Operator","Okay, great. Our last question for today is Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi. Thanks for getting me in guys. I appreciate that. If we think about the CVS relationship in the fact that it was just sort of re-upped for June, is there some anticipation that over time the margin with them could get better, meaning like are we in a situation right now where the first sort of 12 months of this relationship, the margins from that contract might be worse and over time they could get better?","Brian Tyler","Well, first let me say, we are always happy to renew our customers and we're always happy when they grow. We are experiencing a shift in the mix of business \u2013 on our margin rate perspective as you see in our results, I mean great topline growth, but there is a margin rate impact in there. We're never disappointed when our customers grow and we think it's always additive to the business.","Kevin Caliendo","One quick follow-up. Can you talk about the performance and impact NorthStar would have had in the quarter?","Brian Tyler","We don't specifically talk about NorthStar, but when we think about our generics portfolio, NorthStar is obviously a critical part of that and we're very pleased with the performance of NorthStar, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making there.","Britt Vitalone","I think the relationships with the manufacturers in NorthStar have really evolved over the years that are quite productive, and I think that's what's supporting the success that we're seeing there.","Brian Tyler","Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thanks again for your interest in giving us some of your time this morning. Thank you, Suzanne, for facilitating this call. Just maybe to conclude, I really think the fundamentals inside the business were strong. The macro healthcare environment is supporting a stable market.","We executed well in the second quarter. I'm very proud of the teams and the execution. We're continuing to drive cost savings. We're continuing to speed up our decision making. We're continuing to make investments where we think we have opportunities for growth, and I feel good about our fiscal 2020 full-year outlook.","My confidence is of course, rooted in the 80,000 employees that come to work every day for McKesson for our shareholders, really embodying our values, including integrity. They do the right thing and our execution and success are a direct result of their contribution. So I want to say thank you to them. None of this is possible without you.","And now let me hand the call over to Holly for review of our upcoming events. Holly?","Holly Weiss","Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in mid-January and we will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and goodbye.","Operator","And thank you for joining today's conference call.

Please go ahead.","Erin Lampert","","Thank you, Talarie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6.00 PM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO related adjustments.

Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our Web site for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","","Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. We reported results for the fourth quarter and full year that reflect strong operating results across all of our businesses. For the full year, revenues were up 13% to $137.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased by 31% over the prior year to $8.35.","Fiscal 2014 was a year of exceptional execution across McKesson. There are many areas to highlight, but to name just a few we saw tremendous performance in our generics business, including strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program. We delivered solid results from the first full year of the PSS World Medical acquisition and met or exceeded all of our year one integration priorities.","We expanded our long-standing distribution agreement with Rite Aid to include the sourcing and distribution of all of Rite Aid's brands and generic pharmaceutical requirements. And we secured the acquisition of Celesio in a disciplined manner and established a platform for McKesson as a global leader in pharmaceutical distribution.","In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we've generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year another outstanding result. We successfully funded the acquisition of Celesio while maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and we invested $415 million in capital to support the growth of our businesses.","I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2014, and would like to take this opportunity to thank the employees of McKesson for their dedication to our customers and their constant focus on delivering exceptional value in all they do.","Today, we also provided fiscal 2015 guidance of $10.40 to $10.80 per diluted share and expected year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share of 25% to 29%, reflecting strong growth across our broad portfolio of businesses and the expected full year results of our acquisition of Celesio.","We are at an exciting time in the 181 year history of our company. We have a solid portfolio of growing businesses that are performing very well. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth that we expect across our businesses and we've positioned McKesson as a leader in the global healthcare supply chain by expanding our success of leading global sourcing capabilities and direct relationships with our manufacturing partners to deliver value to our customers.","Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. As we entered this election year healthcare topics remained in the spotlight both at Federal and State level. The long anticipated implementation of the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act were launched in recent months and I believe we are only at the beginning of the evolution we should expect to see in healthcare in the United States for years to come. With full suite of capabilities to help our diverse customer base navigate change we are actively engaged in supporting them as they evolve their business.","Pharmacies are increasingly positioning themselves as convenient alternative sites for primary care and offering services to patients to assist them in managing their health. Payers and providers are collaborating in innovative ways to design effective value based reimbursement programs that will slowly shift our fee for service based approach to a care delivery to our payment for value approach tied to outcomes delivered by providers. And consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare than ever before.","We see more health plans and employers offering effective incentives for preventive care as well as wellness programs to help people with chronic conditions manage their own health. Our customers continue to seek solutions to help them thrive in this dynamic environment. This includes solutions for reducing their costs, navigating evolving payment models, meeting increasing regulatory requirements and improving the quality and the customer experience.","McKesson stands unique in the industry for the depth of our knowledge and the insight and the challenges and opportunities our customers face. It is our comprehensive and solution-oriented approach that sets us apart as we focus on providing value for our customers and in return creating customers for life.","Moving now to some of the business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Distribution Solutions had another excellent year driven by strong execution in all of our businesses. In fiscal 2014, Distribution Solutions' revenue increased 13% and operating margins increased by 31 basis points over the prior year to 2.39%. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada delivered strong results for the year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2014 and led the strong expansion of our generics business.","Our OneStop proprietary Generics program continues to deliver great value to our customers and we were pleased to see excellent growth during the year. More of our customers are buying more of their generics from McKesson, which also helped fuel the growth in our generic business in fiscal 2014.","And as I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased with the trust and confidence that Rite Aid placed in McKesson by making the decision to expand their relationship with us to include the sourcing and distribution of all generic and brand pharmaceuticals, and I'm confident this agreement will deliver excellent value to both companies as we complete the transition over the coming months.","In fiscal 2014, we've also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintain steady levels of compensation in return.","McKesson's global sourcing team continues to drive significant value for our Company and for our customers. Our team has developed innovative programs that help expand and foster strong partnerships with the best manufacturers across the globe. We are excited about the opportunities to continue to leverage this global sourcing capability as we expand our relationships going forward.","And finally, I'd like to mention Health Mart. Health Mart continued its strong track record of growth during our fiscal 2014, ending the year with nearly 3,300 stores. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver innovative programs and services to our community pharmacy customers, and we are proud of our growing and thriving Health Mart community of pharmacists.","In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe the business remains extremely well positioned for continued success.","Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid revenue growth in fiscal 2014. We expanded our business in Canada by winning new customers and growing our business with existing customers. And even in a tough generic pricing environment, we continued to see solid contributions from our Canadian business through efficient management of our distribution network, growth and investment in our Canadian specialty business and a constant focus on our customers' success.","Finally, our specialty business delivered solid financial results through growth across our broad portfolio of specialty solutions. We made steady progress in the growth of the number of physicians who are part of the U.S. oncology network, and we also grew our core oncology distribution and services business. We experienced solid growth in services for other multispecialty areas and strong adoption of our proprietary technologies for these specialist physicians.","Last year at this time, we were talking about the impact sequestration cuts were expected to have on medical oncology reimbursement. U.S. oncology continues to grow despite this headwind. One of the great advantages of our model is our ability to work with our physician partners to drive productivity and clinical advances across our network and that makes U.S. oncology a great place for physicians and an excellent care setting for patients.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services; upon achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio in February, we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio into McKesson's financial results. Today, if you've seen our new reporting format, and going forward, the revenue results for Celesio reported and represented in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line.","I will remind you that while we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio, we are still working through the domination process, which upon completion will allow us to begin to exercise operating control over the Company.","We continue to believe that we will complete the steps required to register the domination agreement by the end of the first half of fiscal 2015. Upon achieving operating control of the Company, we can begin to work collaboratively with Celesio to implement our synergy plan. In the meantime, we've established a jointly staffed coordination office to begin important planning efforts in a number of functional areas. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead with Celesio and at the same time, we are mindful of the hard work that is in front of us.","In fiscal 2014, reported results include two months of revenue for Celesio and therefore our reported year-over-year growth in international pharmaceutical distribution and services will increase significantly throughout the year. That being said, for McKesson's fiscal 2015, we expect to underline full-year revenue growth of this business to be in the low single digits.","Our medical-surgical business delivered strong results with 57% growth in revenues in fiscal 2014. The acquisition of PSS World Medical growth in our markets and terrific execution all contributed to this result. As I've mentioned all year, I've been extremely impressed with our team and the results they've delivered through the first year of the integration of this great business.","Now as we look ahead, the team has begun an important phase of the integration which includes combining the distribution and IT infrastructure of the companies. We have ambitious plans that we think are very achievable for this phase of the integration and we have the best team in the business to carry it through to success. What has been most notable to me in this integration effort is our team's steadfast focus on ensuring we are providing the best value and most comprehensive set of solutions to our customers.","For fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth in the medical-surgical business to be in the mid-single-digits now that we have fully lapped the PSS acquisition.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions, and I'm confident this business is very well positioned for the future. As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will increase significantly driven by the acquisition of Celesio, and we expect operating margins to expand toward the upper end of our long-term margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 5% to $3.2 billion. Full year adjusted operating profit was up 25% to $467 million. I'm pleased to report that we made progress in a number of key areas, including delivering solutions for value-based reimbursement, helping customers optimize performance and analytics and business intelligence, and we're making advances now in our connectivity and data interoperability initiatives.","During fiscal 2014 we saw a solid growth in of our connectivity and payer-facing businesses, which serve as the foundation for the investment areas I mentioned earlier. And we continue to work with our customers as they deal with delays and the expected implementation of ICD-10 and meaningful use standards.","Looking forward to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenue will decline modestly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity and payer-facing businesses will be offset by an expected revenue decline in other areas. We expect that operating margins in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2015 to the upper end of our long-term margin goal of mid-teens.","In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better care, and better connectivity.","To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan as we enter fiscal 2015 to reflex growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, and capabilities of propelled McKesson, as a global leader in healthcare services. We're in the business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2015.","I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80.","With that I will turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?","James A. Beer","","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As you've just heard, we are very pleased by the strength of our results this quarter and for the full year. We've had a great year of operating performance including strong growth in adjusted earnings per share, record operating cash flow, and the acquisition of Celesio.","Looking forward, we believe our strategic and operational execution during fiscal 2014 will set the foundation for continued adjusted EPS growth.","Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses. Before I begin, there are three aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention.","First, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the consolidation of Celesio\u2019s results for the two-month period ended March 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, McKesson's share of Celesio\u2019s net income for the two-months ended March 31 was offset by a charge to cost of sales associated with a reversal of a step-up to fair value of Celesio\u2019s inventory at the date of acquisition. Therefore McKesson's share of Celesio's results had no material impact on adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year.","Second, as detailed on Schedules 3A and 3B, we have revised our revenue presentation for the Distribution Solutions segment. Celesio's revenues are presented within a new caption called international pharmaceutical distribution and services.","Additionally, the results from our Canadian and U.S. pharmaceutical distribution businesses are now both included within a broader North America pharmaceutical distribution and services caption. This line also includes the revenues of our specialty business. Medical-surgical distribution and services business continues to be reported separately.","Lastly, it is also important to note that Schedules 3A and 3B provide segment financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, but reflect 100% of the results of Celesio for the two months ended March 31 in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You'll recall that the non-controlling interest in Celesio is presented below our net income line as outlined on Schedule 1.","Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2014 adjusted EPS of $8.35, which excludes four items, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.","Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 25% for the quarter and 13% for the full year to $137.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 35% for the quarter and 26% for the full year to $8.6 billion, primarily driven by strong execution in our distribution businesses, market growth and our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were up 50% for the quarter, driven mainly by our acquisition of Celesio. For the full year, excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, total company adjusted operating expenses increased 5%.","For fiscal 2015, we expect operating expenses will increase year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Celesio. Other income for the full year of $46 million was 35% higher than the prior year, primarily due to non-recurring gains in the fourth quarter.","Full year adjusted interest expense increased to $28 million versus the prior year to $257 million. This increase was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio, including interest associated with our fiscal fourth quarter bond issuance of $4.1 billion, interest on debt used to initially finance the acquisition and interest on the debt acquired from Celesio. For fiscal 2015, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be higher based on the new level of combined McKesson and Celesio debt.","Now moving to taxes, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canadian revenue agency third quarter charge of $122 million, we ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 31.2%. Our full year adjusted tax rate was lower than our expectations driven by favorable discrete tax items recognized during the fourth quarter that contributed approximately $0.11 to our adjusted EPS. Our share of Celesio's results during the quarter did not significantly impact our full year tax expense.","Looking forward our fiscal 2015 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%. However this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the full year totaled $1.9 billion and our adjusted earnings by diluted share totaled $8.35.","Overall, this year's earnings per share benefited significantly from the strong performance in our U.S. pharmaceutical business specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings. In addition, we realized a full year of contribution from our acquisition of PSS within our medical-surgical business.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to $233 million. This reduction was predominantly driven by $800 million in share repurchases completed late in our fiscal 2013.","Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2015 is $236 million. We have not planned for share buybacks in our FY 2015 plan. Particular FY 2015 capital allocation priorities include acquiring additional Celesio shares that may be put to us during our domination process and reducing our current degree of leverage, including planning for fiscal 2016 debt maturities.","That being said, it is important to note that there has been no change to our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment, which includes a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 26% for the quarter and increased 13% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and 2014 and from market growth.","During fiscal 2015, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase significantly driven by Celesio. North America Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue for the full year increased 7%, driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business.","For fiscal 2015, we expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth compared to fiscal 2014. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized $4.8 billion of Celesio revenue in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line. This line includes 100% of Celesio's revenues for the two months ended March 31, 2014.","For fiscal 2015, on a constant currency basis, we expect low single-digit growth in the underlying annual revenues of Celesio. Medical-surgical revenues were up 28% for the quarter and up 57% for the full year, driven by the acquisition of PSS. We continue to perform well against our three-year synergy business case. During fiscal 2015, we will continue our integration efforts while delivering mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 30% for the full year on a 13% increase in segment revenues, resulting in a 31 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year.","As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect continued adjusted operating profit growth for the segment driven by our acquisition of Celesio, further progress on PSS synergies and the contribution from our generic drug distribution and services businesses. Specifically, our generics businesses will benefit from increased generic launches, expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts.","Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 39% for the full year, driven mainly by our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 6% versus the prior year. Distribution Solutions full-year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $3.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 239 basis points. In fiscal year 2015, we expect high single-digit basis point growth in the Distribution Solutions operating margin.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the quarter and up 5% for the full year to $3.2 billion as noted on Schedules 3A and 3B. Adjusted operating profit increased 138% for the quarter, primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues and the effect of $36 million in asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.","For the full year, adjusted operating profit increased 25% to $467 million. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 14.67% increasing 227 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a favorable shift in our mix of income.","Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased to 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by impairment charges incurred in the prior year and increased 3% for the full year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline modestly year-over-year as growth in our payor facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by a revenue decline in our Horizon hospital software business along with the impact of eliminating a low-margin product line. During the coming year, we expect to achieve a mid-teens adjusted operating margin, in line with the high-end of the range for this previously articulated long-term goal.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Since only two months of Celesio\u2019s results were included in the quarter and year, I\u2019ll discuss our working capital metrics excluding Celesio. However, these metrics include the full year of results from our acquisition of PSS.","For receivables, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 25 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased one day from the prior year to 32 days. Our days sales in payables increased to 53 from 51 days in the prior year. Our working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in record cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion during our fiscal year. We ended the year with a cash balance of $4.1 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore.","Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015. Internal capital spending totaled $415 million for the full year, which includes Celesio spending of $15 million for the two months ended March 31. For fiscal 2015, internal capital spending should be between $575 million and $625 million, with the increase being primarily driven by Celesio.","Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some of the important aspects of our acquisition of Celesio. As discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we launched a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio during our fiscal fourth quarter. This tender offer closed subsequent to the end of our fiscal year and consistent with our expectations only nominally increased our ownership in Celesio to approximately 76% on a fully diluted basis.","With greater than 75% ownership in Celesio, we continue to expect that we will secure operational control late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. The current fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates the anticipated transaction accretion and the modest synergies that we expect to derive from Celesio in the coming year. It is important to note that in our fiscal 2015 guidance, we have assumed that we own 76% of Celesio. We have also assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro.","Now, before I conclude, I would point out that in today\u2019s earnings press release, we detailed the key assumptions for fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80. As always, our plan includes certain risks, but overall, we are very pleased with our outlook for the coming year.","Our plan provides strong adjusted EPS growth from our continued operational and strategic execution, and allows us to create significant value for our customers, manufacturing partners, and shareholders.","Thank you. and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Talarie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Steven Valiquette, UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Thanks, good afternoon. Just a question on the generic price trends. You had that \u2013 there was a bullet in the slide deck or in the press release about price trends on generics outside the exclusivity periods expected to be in the high single-digits, and you\u2019re saying that\u2019s a decline from the trend in fiscal 2014. So I just want to make sure; firstly, you\u2019re talking about growth there sort of declines, but also I think both of them I think are probably a lot higher than what I thought they were as far as the trend lines for fiscal 2014 and 2015. So I guess any additional color on what\u2019s going on there would be definitely helpful? Thanks.","James A. Beer","","Well, as you say, the guidance that we have there in the press release talks about growth in FY 2015. It\u2019s between the high-single-digit realm. Yes, that is lower than the percentage growth that we saw for generics that are past that exclusivity period that we saw in fiscal 2014. So, it is a relative headwind year-over-year, but still growth for fiscal 2015 year-over-year.","John H. Hammergren","","Steven, these are price trends, not the growth of the market overall. This is just the trend of price inflation on generics. So we do expect this year to be a good launch year for generics.","Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. For the quarter just reported though, was there pretty consistent trends in the March quarter versus what you saw back in the December quarter sequentially or was there a little bit of tapering off on some of the economics tied to that? Just curious on the sequential quarterly trend.","John H. Hammergren","","Well, at the beginning of the year, we talked about the strength in the first half of the year and we expected that to moderate in the back half and that\u2019s exactly what we saw in our third and fourth quarters.","Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Thanks very much and good afternoon. John, I just want to make sure that I understood this correctly. Operational control late in the first half of 2015, but, just being conservative as far as the guidance goes on Celesio?","John H. Hammergren","","Well, the operational control is a technical accomplishment that has to be reached after a shareholder meeting and a bunch of other things that we have to do from a European perspective or German perspective. So that is proceeding as we have planned. There is no change in our forecast when we expected to achieve operational control.","As you recall, we wanted to have the 75% threshold, which we thought would enable this to happen in the timeframe that we\u2019ve outlined. We did pick up another percent in ownership from 75% to 76%, which is really also what we had expected. Our guidance that we talked about \u2013 we said in our guidance that Celesio was going to grow moderately this year including our first year modest synergies. So, I\u2019m not quite sure what portion of our guidance you\u2019re asking the question about. Is it the operational control, the ownership percentage or talk about the\u2026","Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Yes. Maybe just trying to understand that a little more clearly. So, you are talking about the operational control first half of 2015, but you are saying that ownership is at 76%. At 76%, you don\u2019t have operational control, isn\u2019t that correct?","John H. Hammergren","","That\u2019s correct. We have to go through a couple of more steps. We don\u2019t believe there is any risk in us not obtaining operational control, but we don\u2019t have it automatically just from ownership. We don\u2019t need 100% to get operational control. So what will happen is, we\u2019ll get this operational control, which will allow us to be more interactive with the company than we can today, because we still have a responsibility with regard to operational control to manage the business independent of McKesson and that will change when we achieve operational control.","The difference between 76% and 100% ownership is just how much of the earnings we actually consolidated in the end and that\u2019s what James was trying to describe. So we have 100% of the revenue in, we take out the minority ownership from an earnings perspective on that full schedule.","Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful.","James A. Beer","","And I\u2019d just add to that if I could, the attainment of operational control towards the end of the first half of fiscal 2015 that allows us to really get going on the synergy business case.","Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","And then just so I understand when you look at for example Celesio reported today and may talk about the German market reimbursement economics getting better. Are those trends that you are going to talk to us about John or James going forward and what are your overall thoughts on those markets right now?","John H. Hammergren","","Well, it\u2019s difficult for us to talk about their view of their markets until we get operational controls. So I think you should expect us to be more open and perhaps, discuss more freely what\u2019s going on in the various businesses inside of Celesio and various markets inside of Celesio. Our view, I have spent a lot of time in Europe now with the country managers and I think Paul, and I both would share a point of view that business is run by professional managers we respect and admire what they are doing in many of their markets.","And in their press release this morning, they did talk about the strength in their European pharmacy network activities and the strength in particular, Lloyds out of the U.K. and we certainly have seen some of that in our travels. I think it\u2019s probably difficult for us to speculate at this point what will happen with the German discounting in the outside our end of our fiscal year, which is really what they are referring to.","Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you for the clarification.","John H. Hammergren","Yes.","Operator","","And next, we\u2019ll move to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Yes, hi, good afternoon. Some questions around the Rite Aid contribution, so how should we think of the ramp up for the Rite Aid distribution agreements throughout the year? Also, does guidance factor in improved economics to OneStop from your enhanced scale that comes with the Rite Aid contract?","John H. Hammergren","","Thanks for the question, Ricky. The guidance we\u2019ve provided includes our entire outlook for the year. so it does include our view of the ramp-up of our relationship with Rite Aid. What\u2019s great about the Rite Aid relationship for both Rite Aid and McKesson is that we don\u2019t have any structural impediments to our speed to market and we were able to move very rapidly once that agreement was complete to work with our manufacturing partners to begin building momentum against the opportunity that lies ahead for all of us.","I would say to you that I think we\u2019re substantially complete now with the work that we need to do with manufacturers. As to the rollout of the service offering to Rite Aid related to distribution of generics, we\u2019re very, very early in that process. We have only just begun the process of serving the Rite Aid stores or some of the Rite Aid stores with their generic requirements.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Is that something that will take your full fiscal year to achieve?","John H. Hammergren","","I think it will ramp up over the next half of the year. Next two to three months, we should be well into it.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John H. Hammergren","Yes.","Operator","","Next, we\u2019ll move on to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Hey John, I just want to follow up on the generic question. Essentially, given that the Celesio revenues are now sort of being consolidated and you\u2019ve pulled Rite Aid into the fold, and I guess you answered this by suggesting that substantially you\u2019ve completed all the work with the manufacturers. I guess what I\u2019m kind of curious is, have you been able to take that incremental volume amount to the manufactures and start to renegotiate the terms of those agreements? And if you\u2019re not, are you starting to see some benefits today and if not, how long will that ultimately take?","John H. Hammergren","","When I spoke about the Rite Aid implementation, the first step really was to bring the combined volumes of our corporations together and go to the marketplace to make sure that we are providing the best opportunity to the manufacturers to gain access to that share position. We are now in the process of implementing the generics actually into \u2013 the distribution business into Rite Aid, but the value for McKesson relative to the renegotiation should begin to be realized basically effective right now at the beginning of this fiscal year.","I might note however that none of the Celesio synergies or volumes or generic purchases, et cetera have been included in any of this upfront work with the manufacturers. It\u2019s simply been McKesson\u2019s business that has continued to grow and thrive, including the incremental Health Mart stores we\u2019ve added, as well as the increment of Rite Aid generic bind that we were able to put together and complete \u2013 as I said, substantially complete the negotiations with manufacturers as we sit here today. And clearly, as we get into the late summer months, we should be reworking those relationships to include the Celesio volume as well.","Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","So James, and if I could just follow up on that Celesio accretion analysis. Essentially, when you guys first announced the deal, I think you suggested it\u2019d be a $1 to $1.20 accretive and that was with very modest synergies. Now that you have76% ownership, should we think about that year one accretion being in the $0.75 to $0.80 range with only moderate synergies because based on John\u2019s comments, it kind of sounds like the Company hasn\u2019t been able to bring those volumes into the fold and start to really exercise some of that synergy potential at this point.","James A. Beer","","Well, we stand by the $1 to $1.20 of accretion for 100% of the ownership. Of course, as you say, we\u2019re only at 76% and that was for the first 12 months of operations, after beginning of February. So in essence, we got the first two months of that in the Q4, just finished and then the balance of the 10 months, we\u2019d be receiving in fiscal 2015. Now, the reason that we ended up net neutral in fiscal 2014 was because we had this one-time inventory write-up consistent with the acquisition accounting and so forth.","Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Next, we\u2019ll move to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Hey. Good afternoon, John and James. Thanks for taking the question, John; I don\u2019t know if I missed \u2013 if I didn\u2019t hear this properly. I didn\u2019t hear NorthStar mentioned in the prepared comments. I guess, can you provide any color on how Northstar\u2019s doing and when you\u2019ll have the chance to provide NorthStar products to Rite Aid and Celesio?","John H. Hammergren","","We continue to make great progress with NorthStar and in fact, have launched a version of NorthStar that\u2019s called, Savant in Canada. And so both of those product lines are continuing to gain momentum. Now, clearly, we\u2019re working closely with the manufacturing community to make sure we\u2019ve got the best choice of product and the best choice of partners and the Rite Aid agreement does include NorthStar as one of the value offerings to both companies.","As it relates to Celesio, which is probably premature to talk about, what we might be able to do with NorthStar or with the NorthStar model as it relates to many of the markets in Europe, but we clearly will have that as part of our evaluation as we get into that next phase.","George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Maybe a quick follow-up. A couple of your competitors are using JV or GPO type structures for the procurement of generic drugs. Is that something that makes sense to do with the inclusion of Celesio, or is the straight integration just McKesson buying the drugs directly from manufacturers and selling through the \u2013 I guess, through the supply chain, is that the right way? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think about industry structure going forward? Thank you.","John H. Hammergren","","No problem, George. We don\u2019t plan to have any JVs or any type of unusual structure to get access to the synergy we believe are possible, and there was no JV structure as it relates to Rite Aid, will not be one related to Celesio. It will be McKesson\u2019s sourcing operation that does all of the work.","George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","John H. Hammergren","Yes.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move on next to Steve Halper with FBR & Company.","John H. Hammergren","Steve, are you on mute?","Operator","Mr. Halper, your line is now open.","Erin Lampert","Talarie, maybe, we\u2019ll move to the next question.","Operator","Certainly, and we\u2019ll move on to the next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","","Yes, thanks. Can you guys hear me?","John H. Hammergren","Yes.","Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, just going back to Celesio real quick. Obviously, you\u2019re going to the core process. You talked about a jointly staffed coordination office. Can you talk about specifically what then \u2013 is this more focused on the integration itself, or is this, as other people have kind of asked, more towards how you approach manufacturers?","John H. Hammergren","","Well, it\u2019s a little bit of both. A part of that coordination activity is to make sure we\u2019re getting after the synergies that we think exist in the primary synergies we\u2019ve outlined in our conversations regarding Celesio is around product sourcing. so clearly, that\u2019s a top priority and those teams are already beginning to do some work. But as I said it really can\u2019t accelerate until we get pass this operational control phase. With the other part of the project management or coordination office role is to make sure that we understand what Celesio is working on today and what they might need our assistance with, things like IT or other kinds of projects that we might be able to lend a helping hand to. So, I would say that it\u2019s basically a process of understanding more completely Celesio\u2019s operations and corporate functions, so that work is under way.","Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","","Great. And as a follow-up James. I don\u2019t know if I saw it in the assumptions you gave on the guidance. Can you give us an estimate of, what sort of interest expense are you expecting for fiscal 2015? Thank you.","James A. Beer","","Yes. We would expect interest expense to be rising year-over-year, consistent with the new debt that we took on to finance Celesio. So that is all publicly available and so I\u2019ll just leave at there at the moment.","Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move on to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back, John, if I could to the generic inflation assumption in guidance. I know this has been a tailwind if you will for the last several years. It seems like Distribution Solutions, I was just curious, how much visibility do you have into this variable and given that your expectations are for it to moderate a bit into fiscal 2015. Just wondering what the main drivers of that in your view could be?","John H. Hammergren","","Well, the inflation \u2013 just to remind the listeners, generics has been driven by a relatively small subset of the overall generic portfolio and a relative small subset of manufacturers. Like any other estimate that we have to make, whether it\u2019s brand inflation or generic inflation or generic launches, et cetera, what we attempt to do is use the best resources we have internal to the company and whatever resources are available externally to create those views. I think we were correct on our assumption that it was going to moderate in the back half of this year, of fiscal 2014 which it did, and we believe the assumption we\u2019ve given relative to FY 2015 is our best thinking as it stands today for what inflation will be.","It certainly could be wrong, and the manufacturers don\u2019t typically tell us what they\u2019re going to do. One of the reasons we state our assumptions so clearly in our press release is, so those of you on the phone can create your own view of our assumptions, and provide that input into your own models as you reflect on what we\u2019ve done. But we still think it\u2019s going to be an important part of our 2015 performance. We expect it to still be very solid, and it just will be slightly less than we experienced in 2014.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up within specialty. John, you continue to sound very pleased with the performance of U.S. oncology. I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen a shift at all in the site of care within oncology treatment? Any pressure in the marketplace for oncology treatment to be done more in the acute care setting?","John H. Hammergren","","We do see that pressure. It ebbs and flows depending on the markets and where our physicians are based. I would say that the pressure is not coming from payers and it\u2019s not coming from patients. The pressure is usually driven by the purchase of a practice where a local hospital or hospital system decides to buy a group of oncologists that were customers of McKesson.","And many times if the hospital is a customer of McKesson, we\u2019ll retain all of that business, clearly if it just go through standard distribution. But I think the beauty of the U.S. Oncology model is that, many times we\u2019re able to follow those physicians into the hospital setting and begin to manage the practices on behalf of the hospital, maybe you pick up net new physicians that are part of the network as the hospital relies on our expertise to continue to work with those doctors to optimize the quality of care and the cost of that care.","So, although it continues to be something we have to pay attention to, and on occasion we\u2019ll lose a practice if a customer that goes into a hospital and we don\u2019t have any affiliation with the hospital afterwards and obviously, that\u2019s a net loss for us. But I would say the team has been very good at working with our customers in these transitions and retaining our position.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks.","","John H. Hammergren","Yes.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move on next to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Thanks for taking the question. So just a few technical questions, James. Celesio, was it fair to say that it added about 700 basis points to total revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter?","James A. Beer","","Yes. It added about $8 billion in revenue in fiscal fourth quarter.","Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Okay, got it.","James A. Beer","Yes.","Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, and then, I know obviously annual guidance is being given here and that\u2019s historically been the case, but just as you think about how the first half of the fiscal year will gate into the second half, obviously you\u2019ve got Celesio that will be coming on board from an earnings contribution perspective in the back half, as well as \u2013 well, I guess that was somewhat offset kind of a slight headwind from a little bit lower generic pricing increases. So, is it kind of fair to say, first half 45% of earnings and back half 55% of earnings, if we kind of think about the midpoint of guidance?","James A. Beer","","Well, just one thing I misspoke on the Celesio revenue that was $4.8 billion in Q4, not $8 billion.","Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","James A. Beer","So in terms of the mix of earnings during the year, what I would point to is that last year, we had particularly strong earnings in the first half of the year, year-over-year and that was driven by somewhat unusually high generic price increase activity. So returning in our fiscal 2015 plan to more the profile that we saw in fiscal 2013 back through fiscal 2011 that type of picture in some quarterly seasonality.","Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","","We will move next to David Larsen, Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","","Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. For the $1 to $1.20 in Celesio synergies, can you just describe what the nature of that is and would that be expected to be achieved after domination is realized? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren","","So that\u2019s an accretion number, not a synergy number. The synergy number was $275 million to $325 million realized over four years, with a modest impact this fiscal year.","James A. Beer","","Yes. So the $1 to $1.20 of accretion is very largely just our share of Celesio\u2019s earnings. Now again, that always assumed 100% ownership and we only own 76% of the shares at this point. So it\u2019s important to factor that into account.","David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","","And then the driver of the synergies $275 million to $325 million, can you just talk about the nature of those please?","James A. Beer","","By far the most significant driver there are the purchasing synergies that we would look to be able to attain over time. As John said, we\u2019d look to get to $275 million to $325 million per year by year four. So, it will really be that procurement synergy effort that drives that to some modest amount of tank savings that we believe will be available as well.","David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","","Great. Thanks a lot.","John H. Hammergren","","So operator, I don\u2019t think there are any other questions on the phone. So, I think that we\u2019ll wrap this up. I want to thank all of you on the call today for your time. We certainly have a strong plan in place for fiscal 2015 and we\u2019re excited about the tremendous growth opportunities that are available to us across McKesson. I\u2019m certainly once again; proud of our track record in our delivery to our customers and the tremendous financial returns we\u2019ve delivered to our shareholders this year and for many years, and I also want to thank all of our tremendous employees for their effort this last year on driving that success for us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Erin for a view of upcoming events for the financial community.","Erin Lampert","","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the UBS Global Healthcare Conference in New York on May 20th and the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 11th. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and good-bye.","Operator","","And everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and full year. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson.","In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition related expenses and adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Also, James will discuss our operating performance further adjusting for the impact of net charges associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016, as well as the non-cash pretax good will impairment charge which is related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter.","For fiscal '16, we excluded the income sales of two businesses. Consistent with how we\u2019ve discussed our fiscal '17 results in prior earnings calls, which reconcile adjusted earnings to adjusted earnings excluding these unusual items, the supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 results discussed today.","In connection with the issuance of our fiscal 2018 outlook and in consideration of investor feedback, benchmarking relative to superior companies and in line with management's view of our operating performance, we are revising our adjusted earnings definition. The revision will principally exclude gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments including asset impairments and gains or losses on disposal of businesses or assets.","We filed a second 8-K with the SEC today, which includes the full text of our revise definition of adjusted earnings, as well as the recap of quarterly and full-year of fiscal 2017 results. This will allow you to compare our fiscal 2018 outlook to our revised adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017.","For reference, slide 14 of the supplemental presentation provides a visual walk from fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items. Then it bridges that measures to the fiscal \u201917 revise adjusted EPS.","We believe the earnings press release, supplemental slides and the recap of 8-K which all includes non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's underlying operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period.","Please refer to these materials, which may be found in the investor section of our Company website, for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thank you. And here's, John Hammergren.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both of our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. James, will cover our annual financial performance in greater detail. But let me provide some color on the year just concluded.","If we recall, as we entered fiscal 2017, we were working hard to mitigate headwinds resulting from moderating generics inflation and customer consolidation. During fiscal \u201817, we implemented a cost alignment plan to achieve improved efficiencies and realize materials savings across our enterprise. We announced a new sourcing partnership for generics with Walmart. We entered into a plan with Blackstone to create a new scaled healthcare technology business, and we announced several acquisitions intended to, among other things, expand our retail footprint and broaden our specialty capabilities.","We successfully executed against each of these major initiatives, which were transformative in nature and better position to Company for long term growth. However, we did not anticipate the sizable additional headwinds we experienced around pricing for branded pharmaceuticals in the degree of sell side price competition for generics, particularly within the independent retail pharmacy channel.","Let me take a moment to provide an update on those two topics specifically; first on branded pricing. Throughout the past year, there has been increased pressure on manufacturers in the pricing decisions they make, which led the lower inflation levels than we had originally assumed in our fiscal 2017 outlook. However, it is important to note that in the fourth quarter, the compensation that we earn we earned it from brand pricing changes, was largely in line with the expectations that we shared during our last earnings call.","As we entered into a new fiscal year, we\u2019ve assumed a mid-single digit rate of brand inflation, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2017. We believe this level assumed inflation is appropriate given the degree of uncertainty around branded pricing and a reality that we\u2019re not involved in setting drug prices.","Switching now to generic pricing, while the rate of price changes in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio has varied from year-to-year, we\u2019ve historically experienced deflation, which we define as a reduction in our cost of acquiring generic drugs from the manufactures. For McKesson, our multiple drivers of generic deflation, which included competition, supply and maturity of launched products and our sourcing efforts, the rate of deflation is specific to McKesson\u2019s generic product mix, customer mix, ongoing negotiations and relationships with manufactures and our specific fiscal year. We consider it to be unique and proprietary and thus do not disclose rated deflation for our generic purchases. An additional factor impacting generics is a sale price environment. We operate in a competitive marketplace and the competitive nature of generics is a function of market based pricing.","If you recall that in the first half of our fiscal year, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes for McKesson. Overtime, we\u2019re able to recapture that loss volume and retain our share after adjusting our sell side pricing. Consistent with our update, last quarter, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic drugs in the U.S., and less pricing variability within this customer segment.","In the end, it was important that we were able to recapture our volume, but is even more significant to retain and build upon on our longstanding relationships we\u2019ve established with customer base. This included expanding our Health Mart franchises past fiscal year, adding hundreds of new stores.","Next, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our -- next, I would like to discuss our relationship with Walmart. It was a year ago that we announced Claris 1, our now operational collaborative generic sourcing initiative with Walmart. I am very encouraged with the remarkable progress we\u2019ve made in the short amount of time. Walmart is largely realizing these initiatives benefits from this initiative. And we\u2019re now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to realize and share in additional synergies. We are encouraged by the ear success of this initiative, which demonstrates how our sourcing expertise delivers significant value. But we are optimistic that we will identify expanded opportunities to partner with Walmart in the future.","Next, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brand generic, specialty, bio-similar and OTC drug classes in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturer partners in all of these five categories. We continue to address these important changes as we work through our contract renewal cycles.","Moving on to Change Healthcare, I want to thank the current McKesson teams who worked so diligently to successfully launch this new organization. And I want to also thank our former McKesson employees who recently joined a new Company for their ongoing commitment to a thriving healthcare technology enterprise. This dedicated team of individuals successfully delivered on a challenging fiscal '17 Technology Solutions business plan while simultaneously contributing to the closing of the Change Healthcare transaction. I thank them all and congratulate them on their success. Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss McKesson's role in public policy.","Our policy decisions are being evaluated, and McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact our industry and our business and our customers' business, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We continue to engage in dialogue with policy makers as proposals evolve towards legislation. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role, the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally.","In closing, our fiscal 2017 was certainly a tough year and we faced multiple material headwinds that impacted our U.S. pharmaceutical business. I was encouraged by a number of things during the year. First, despite industry challenges, the underlying operating performance of the U.S. pharmaceutical business was improved through our focus on operational excellence and best-in-class customer service. This business is growing and is well positioned.","Next, absent the material UK reimbursement cuts we've previously discussed, Celesio's business has performed nicely. In addition, we completed multiple acquisitions during the year, which had helped to expand our strong platform for growth. For Canada, the business grew nicely in fiscal 2017. And we completed the acquisition of Rexall, expanding our retail pharmacy footprint in Canada. And in medical surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth and substantially grew in the lab space, complementing our non-acute service platform.","Overall, we continue to build the competitiveness of our broad portfolio of businesses, which allowed us to mitigate some of the very material industry challenges we encountered during the year at U.S. Pharmaceutical. I'm extremely proud of this management's team ability to adapt and maintain a constant focus on building the strength of our customer and supplier relationships, which will continue to drive growth and long term value creation for our shareholders.","Last, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication, leadership and consistent focus on putting our customer success at the forefront of everything we do. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we\u2019ll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James Beer","Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are pleased by our strong results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.42 per diluted share which gives us a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2018. I also want to highlight our record operating cash flow in fiscal '17, which allowed us to return more $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders during the past year.","Today, I will review our fiscal 2017 results and introduce our fiscal 2018 guidance range. Before I discuss our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will spend some time walking you through the changes to our definition of adjusted earnings. Now, let\u2019s move to our 2017 results. As I have a lot of information to cover today and we want to provide ample time for Q&A following my remarks, I will primarily focus on our full year fiscal 2017 results.","First, our consolidated results. As a reminder, the fourth quarter and full year revenue and operating results of MTS were impacted by the creation of the Change Healthcare joint venture, as announced on March 2nd, to which McKesson contributed the majority of its MTS businesses. McKesson will account for its equity share of Change Healthcare\u2019s earnings on a one-month lag. Therefore, for the month of March, McKesson\u2019s consolidated income statement contained neither the results of the MTS contributed businesses, nor any equity earnings from the new company.","Consolidated revenues for the full-year increased 5% in constant currency versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions. Full year adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, partially offset by contributions from acquisition closed in fiscal 2017, antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth.","Full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% in constant currency driven by acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plan and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $101 million for the year, an increase of 63% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [indiscernible], a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands. Interest expense of $308 million decreased 13% in constant currency for the year consistent with our expectations.","Now, moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate, excluding cost alignment plan charges and the impact to the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in the second quarter, was 22.6% for the year, driven by the beneficial impact of the on-shoring of our MTS intellectual property in the third quarter, our mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest or NCI was $83 million for the year, an increase of 60% in constant currency. The increase in NCI was primarily driven by Claris 1, the joint sourcing entity that we have created with Walmart, and the acquisition of Vantage Oncology.","Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, totaled $2.9 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS was $11.61 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $12.91 per diluted share. During the year, we recorded $0.04 charge related to the cost alignment plan and in the second quarter we recorded a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.26 related to our EIS business.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the fourth quarter, we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $250 million, bringing our total share repurchases in fiscal 2017 to $2.3 billion. As a result of share repurchase activity, particularly in late fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2017, our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 4% year-over-year to $223 million.","Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $197.1 million were up 5% year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 4% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $26 billion for the year on a constant currency basis, up 11%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $1.2 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 3% for the year, driven by the market growth and acquisition. Distribution Solutions adjusted growth profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% on a constant currency basis for the year, driven by competition in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing, partially offset by contributions from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017 antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth.","Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the year. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plans and ongoing cost reduction actions. When removing the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased year-over-year.","Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 11% in constant currency year-over-year at $3.9 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 35 basis points, driven by the same factors as previously discussed.","Now, moving to Technology Solutions. As a remainder, our MTS segment for fiscal '17 reflects only 11 months of results for those businesses that were contributed to change healthcare. Revenues decreased 9% for the year to $2.6 billion on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 11% in constant currency from the prior year. Despite realizing only 11 months of results from the contributed MTS businesses, adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 4% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin rate of 22.33%, up 295 basis points versus the prior year.","We're very pleased with the performance of the Technology Solutions segment in fiscal 2017 as the team works simultaneously to execute their business plans and close the Change Healthcare transaction. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our day sales outstanding decreased one day to 27 days. Our day sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 30 days. And our day sales in payables increased two days from the prior year to 61 days.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion with approximately $2.3 billion held offshore. For the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion on acquisitions, repaid approximately $1.6 billion in long term debt, spent $562 million on internal capital investments and paid $253 million in dividends. In addition, McKesson repurchased approximately $2.3 billion in common stock in fiscal 2017 and we now have $2.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","In fiscal '17, McKesson generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, inclusive of the $256 million in cash outflows related to the cost alignment plan and our settlement with the DEA and DoJ. The year-over-year growth of approximately 29% was primarily driven by several working capital initiatives across our U.S. businesses and lower cash taxes.","To wrap up my fiscal 2017 comments, while McKesson face significant challenges during the year, I'm pleased with how we were able to manage through adversity, drive strong cash flow and end the year in a solid financial position. Now before I get to our fiscal 2018 outlook, let me take a moment to discuss the revision to our definition of adjusted earnings. After careful consideration, we have made the decision to revise our definition of adjusted earnings effective with our fiscal '18 outlook. We believe this revision will allow us to provide better clarity on our underlying operating performance as it closely aligns with both how we internally manage the enterprise and the definition used by others in our industry.","Let me walk you through the changes at a high level. First, the revised definition retains the amortization of acquisition related intangible, LIFO-inventory related charges or credits and acquisition related expenses and adjustments; although, this category has been expanded to include certain fair value adjustments. An example of a fair value adjustment is the expected non-cash deferred revenue haircut in fiscal '18, resulting from the Change Healthcare transaction. Second, the revised definition will now adjust for gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments, which will include impairments, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or assets and the full month standalone category of claim and litigation charges or credits.","The restructuring charges that will be excluded are represented by programs such as the cost alignment plan or other restructuring programs that are considered significant. And the other adjustments category will exclude items such as the EIS goodwill impairment charge we took in the second quarter and gains from sales of businesses, such as the two differences we sold in the fiscal 2016. Again, these adjustments are intended to provide investors a better view of the underlying operating performance at McKesson.","I encourage you to review the second 8-K that we filed today for the full description of each item included in our revised adjusted earnings definition, as well as the re-cost of our fiscal 2017 results, utilizing this revised definition of adjusted earnings. Before I wrap up my comments on adjusted earnings, I want to confirm that as you would expect we will continue to provide all the GAAP information that we have historically provided, including the reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to our GAAP earnings.","Now, let me provide you with the details of our fiscal 2017 results on this revised basis. In order for you to drive the year-over-year performance we expect in fiscal 2018; then I will provide details on our fiscal 2018 outlook. I will point you to slide 14 of the supplemental presentation, as it provides a fiscal 2017 EPS walk, but includes reconciliation from adjusted earnings excluding unusual items of $12.91 per diluted share to our revised adjusted earnings. From the $12.91 per diluted share, we will now exclude the benefit of $144 million or $0.39 per diluted share in antitrust supplements recorded in fiscal 2017, and $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share in gains on asset dispositions.","We will also exclude two headwinds; first, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in fair-value adjustments; and second, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in restructuring charges. These adjustments result in revised adjusted earnings of $12.54 per diluted share for fiscal '17.","Now, turning to our fiscal 2018 outlook. In fiscal 2018, McKesson expects adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.75 to $12.45. This guidance range reflects a decrease of 6% to approximately flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. To be clear, the fiscal 2018 outlook excludes the negative impact of the non-cash deferred revenue hiccup from the Change Healthcare transaction, which is now expected to be approximately $200 million, as it will be excluded from adjusted earnings based on our revised definition.","In lieu of outlining each of the assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will refer you to the list of the key assumptions included in the press release we issued today. Instead I will walk you through the key items included in our outlook. First, I\u2019ll start with the overall market environment. We expect Distribution Solutions revenues, which are primarily derived from North America, to grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by market growth and recent acquisitions.","In the U.S. market, branded pharmaceutical manufacturer prices are tuned to increase by a mid-single digit percentage in fiscal 2018. This is a more conservative assumption than the results from fiscal '17. As we do not make these pricing decisions and because there may be variability in the timing, frequency and magnitude of pricing actions taken by manufacturers, we believe our assumption of mid-single digit price increases is prudent.","On the generics side, we expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals with increase in price in fiscal 2018, consistent with what we experienced in fiscal '17. We also expect the profit contribution from the launch of new oral generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market to be nominal year-over-year. As John mentioned, our overall basket of generic pharmaceuticals generally declines in price overtime, reflecting competition, supply, the maturity of launched products, and outsourcing efforts. And for the sell side pricing environment, we see the marketplace was competitive or with less pricing variability, consistent with our remarks on our last earnings call in January.","Moving onto Rite Aid, as mentioned in our press release, our guidance range assumes a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. Given our understanding of where things stand today with the pending merger agreement, we feel confident that we would not see volumes transition in this calendar year. If Rite Aid\u2019s volume were to transition in early calendar 2018, this will only have a small impact on our FY18 adjusted earnings per diluted share; although, we would expect a material one-time transition impact to our cash flow, driven by the mix of our business with Rite Aid. It is worth noting that our ongoing domestic and international sourcing scale is such that the potential loss of Rite Aid's volume was not meaningfully hold up our sourcing economics with manufacturers.","Now, let's move to our expanded sourcing agreement with Walmart and the mechanics of Claris 1. We announced our joint souring relationship with Walmart in May 2016. Since that announcement, McKesson and Walmart have worked to build out the new sourcing organization, Claris 1. This new organization first, focused on harmonizing pricing across our respective sourcing arrangement. This was completed late in fiscal 2017. Walmart is likely realizing the benefits from this initiative, and we are now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to share additional synergies.","That being said, because McKesson has control of Claris 1, we consolidate the results of the entity. You will see the full results of Claris 1 in our consolidated P&L, including revenues, gross profit, operating expense and operating profit. We then remove Walmart\u2019s portion of Claris 1 earnings via the non-controlling interest line, which appears below net income in our P&L.","However, it is important to note that the economics from Claris 1 included in the NCI line represents only a portion of the overall value of the expanded relationship with Walmart, as a majority of the joint sourcing value is realized in the cost of goods sold line. This COGS value is directly recognized in the accounts of McKesson and Walmart, and is not a part of the Claris 1 accounts. The non-controlling interest line now removes three items from our net income; Walmart share of Claris 1's earnings; the retail dividend; and partner income associated with other smaller non-wholly owned subsidiaries. We expect our income from non-controlling interest to increase approximately 200% from fiscal 2017.","Now moving to our international segment. We expect percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. In addition, we expect the international business to be impacted by additional UK reimbursement cuts; although, at present, the announced incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are materially smaller than what we experienced in fiscal '17. We will keep you up-to-date on this as the year unfolds. Based on the assumptions outlined, we expect our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin to be between 198 and 208 basis points.","The way to think about our fiscal 2018 adjusted operating margin is that our adjusted operating profit will benefit from our organic growth, the impact of FY17 acquisitions and the profits of our joint venture partners, such as Walmart in the case of Claris 1, which have consolidated in our results in accordance with GAAP. The margin rate is further aided by our revised addition of adjusted earnings and the inclusion of RelayHealth Pharmacy. Partially offsetting these positive items on margin rate will be impacted by our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, assumed weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and the lapping effect of increased competitive sell side pricing.","Moving now to McKesson\u2019s equity investment in Change Healthcare and other MTS considerations. We expect the adjusted equity earnings contribution from Change Healthcare to be between $370 million to $430 million, which reflects our 70% ownership. To be clear, we\u2019re assuming that our equity interest in Change Healthcare will not be diluted by the impact of a potential IPO. The MTS segment also reflects the contribution from our EIS business, which is expected to generate full year revenues of between approximately $450 million and $500 million, has an adjusted operating margin rate in the single digit range. We continue to make progress on reviewing these strategic alternatives for this business.","Now moving to corporate expenses, taxes and our share count. Corporate expenses are expected to be between approximately $435 million and $465 million in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our technology investments and incentive compensation programs being reset to target expectations. The guidance range assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 27%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. This rate is reflective of the ongoing beneficial impact of an inter-company sale of software in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.","Our mix business and the impact of minority interest earnings that are included in profit before tax, but are not taxable to McKesson. We expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2018 to be $213 million, which reflects the impact of share repurchase activity completed in fiscal 2017. In addition, we expect a negative foreign currency impact of up to $0.05 in fiscal 2018.","Switching to cash flow, our operating cash flow is expected to decline by approximately 10% relative to the prior year. This decline is primarily driven by the loss of the majority of MTS' cash flow following the creation of Change Healthcare, as well as very strong cash generation at the end of fiscal 2017. And last, as you think about the quarterly progression of our results in fiscal '18, we expect our results to be waited to the second half of the year, primarily driven by the anticipated strength of fourth quarter results, given the seasonality of branded manufacturer pharmaceutical price increases. And for the first half of fiscal '18, we expect the second quarter will be stronger than the first quarter.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melisa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we\u2019ll first take a question from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher","I'd like to go back to, John, your comments on differential pricing. And I don\u2019t think that was called out as one of the elements impacting the MTS or profit. I know there are quite a few puts and takes there. But has that been a material factor, and could you give us some detail on what you\u2019re trying to do both upstream with the manufacturer and downstream with your customers?","John Hammergren","I do think it is certainly an important factor. I'll leave the materiality to the accountants, but it's certainly been important part of our businesses as we look at it, and we've made significant progress. And in our conversations with both our manufacturing partners, as well as our end user customer partners; so we're excited about the progress. I think people understand that the cost of handling certain of these items is different than having them all blended together. And certainly the services we provide are different and the economics associated with and when the products is different and we're pleased with the progress. We\u2019ve more work to do, we do that systematically as our contracts are revised. But I feel good about the progress, Eric.","Eric Percher","The key driving services that are unique, or is it segmenting fees and charging separately for what you\u2019re providing?","John Hammergren","It's probably a combination of both. clearly, to the extent that our previous discounting didn\u2019t reflect the true cost of handling the products that needed to be modified, and to be extended that customers or manufacturers are asking us to perform new or different services, we\u2019ve taken that on as well. So I think it's simple to mention that. And I don\u2019t think in the past with the way we used to price our contracts, we segmented enough. And as obviously these other categories begin to grow, it's important that we price them in a more discreet fashion than as we\u2019ve attempted to do.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Lisa Gill with J. P. Morgan.","Lisa Gill","John, I just want to go back to some of your comments on Claris 1. As I truly understand where you are with the manufacturers, obviously today, we saw bad time with Express Scripts and increased the size of their procurement entity. Is there any push back around the manufacturers in the anticipation of potentially losing Rite Aid we\u2019ve had -- I mean how do we think about the contracting from that perspective?","John Hammergren","I think, James in his prepared remarks, made a specific comment related to Express and we don\u2019t see any impact related to the potential loss of our Rite Aid business -- and he made a comment about Rite Aid not about Express, so to be clear. And I don\u2019t think that when we get to a certain scale on the certain amount of materiality with the manufacturers, I don\u2019t think there is much of the difference in the way that the manufacturers behave with any of us. I\u2019ve said this before. I believe we\u2019re extremely well positioned and I think our contract is very competitive. I think Walmart has benefitted significantly from the relationship. And as to where we stand in it, the normalization of the agreements between McKesson and Walmart and our respective partners help drive a lot of very quick incremental value to Walmart. And I believe that this next phase as we complete our negotiations the contracting with the manufacturers, we\u2019re already beginning to see a reflection as a combined value of us putting our business together and committing it to these partners for a long period of time. And clearly we have the ability because our customers tell us whether our pricing in the marketplace is competitive or not. And with that customer feedback, we\u2019re constantly adjusting our perspective on what prices, a fair price to sell at and what a fair price to buy at is. And through that intelligence I think we remain very confident in our scale and approach to doing the job it needs to do.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","So one question that I have, John, obviously 2017 was a challenging year, but here we are. And you made some changes to how you revise the definition of adjusted earnings you moved some business to distribution. If we think about the operating market guidance to 198 to 208 -- to 2.8 is this, in your base that you feel that you can extend margins from? And along the same lines, now you talk about mid-single growth rate for distribution for the revenue line. How should we think about the growth algorithm for the operating income? Should we think about mid-single digit as well, if you can just give more color on that?","John Hammergren","Well, I\u2019ll have James jump in here in just a moment. I think that the principle drivers of our challenge in the previous year was the brand price inflation came in obviously below what we expected it to be. And then the very significant issue related to generic pricing that took the sell side of generics in the marketplace. And I think that we would expect that we will get up margin growth, going forward. And so I obviously always think that, and last year we had a surprise, a couple of surprises. But this year, you can see that we really don't have built into our guidance inflation on the generic side beyond nominal; and the branded inflation, we've guided, I think to a responsible range and the underlying operations of our business continue to perform very well; and the generic pricing challenges we face last year in the independent segment, as we've commented in the past, have been somewhat transitory in their nature; and recently, we have to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Those kinds of dislocations don't happen on a frequent basis. So having said all of that, our expectation is that our margins will expand from here.","James Beer","And in terms of the Distribution Solutions\u2019 operating profit, there are few items in through there; first of all, obviously, as we're going to benefit from the acquisitions that we entered into in fiscal '17; then we have these lapping effects of last year's headwinds, both the brand manufacturer price increase situation, as well as on the generic side the sell side environment, particularly through to the independent pharmacists. But setting those headwinds aside, I'm pleased to see U.S. pharma getting back to operating profit growth. And then you add to that the ongoing operating profit growth of remainder portfolio of businesses, which as you know, is quite diverse.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Just to go back and follow-up on the Distribution Solutions operating margin. If I look back in the guidance you guys provided, I mean, if I think back to October when you guys lowered guidance on competitive pressures and in the moderating inflation. And I think about that in the back half of '17. It seems like the negative impact from those changes would have certainly had your operating margins for fiscal '18 pointing to something down you, and yet here you are giving very encouraging operating margin guidance. So other than something like Claris 1 being an incremental positive year-over-year, did anything changed in your underlying assumptions as far as those two specific pressure points that you talked about last year, competitive pressure and moderating inflation. And I guess you -- one just kind of follow on to that, I know you don't guide to gross profit within Distribution Solutions. But would we anticipate, John, that gross profit would also be growing specifically in North American distribution?","John Hammergren","Yes, we certainly would expect gross profit in North American distribution to grow. And I would say, further, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the operations of our Company last year. And continuing this point that progress was largely overshadowed by the significant headwinds that we faced as we went into the back half of last year. And obviously, coming to this year, we\u2019re taking the remainder of those headwinds. But if you actually look under the covers, the rest of our Company is performing quite well and I am pleased with the fact that we can continue to show progress in our business. And clearly, some of the changes James mentioned in terms of the definition of adjusted earnings make our operating performance more clear. And we try to re-cash last years\u2019 and this years\u2019 so you can see how they would have compared. But James jumping here with some other color you\u2019d like to provide\u2026","James Beer","Yes, it's just kind of say for example two things about that change in the definition of adjusted earnings. And in the second 8-K we have broken out the FY '17 data in line with that new definition. So you'll be able to see the year-over-year type effects there. And then also just to reemphasize that because of the way the accounting looks, remember that our profit from our joint venture partners, such as Walmart's profit as a part of Claris 1, that actually gets counted in our operation profit line and therefore benefits of our operating margin rate lower down at the bottom of the P&L, we have to extract that out in terms of the non-controlling interest.","So there is complexity there, and that's very much how GAAP requires us to do things. And again in the 8-K, we've tried to break out in the last of the schedules that we have there both the operating margin on a growth basis, if you will, then also net of that MCI effect. So there are few steps to move through there. But hopefully, we lay things out so you can sort through that.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Steven Velazquez with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven Velazquez","Just regarding the Rite Aid EPS contribution of $0.20 to $0.40 in fiscal '18, I heard that right. I think most of us have seen that EPS ruin rate could then -- it would have been a little bit a higher than that at 13 point of revenues. I guess if you compare that number for FY18 to Rite Aid contribution of the past couple of years. We've been in that same range, or has that come down perhaps from various reasons? Thanks.","John Hammergren","I think it's probably fair to say that when our margins dropped across the Company, and typically in the U.S. pharmaceutical business, I should and know the focus on U.S. pharmaceuticals is a result of the phenomena's we've been talking about that same kind of degradation in the performance of every one of our, probably every one of our customers in the U.S. pharmaceutical business was effected. And it just becomes a question of mix. And so it's fair to say that most of our customers in U.S. pharma are less profitable today than they were a couple of years ago, and you\u2019ve seen it in our overall margin rate in that business\u2026","James Beer","And you\u2019re correct it was $0.20 to $0.40 of contribution from Rite Aid for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian","Point to your generics assumption, setting aside the down street pressures in this past year, that's now less variable. Have you changed the underlying assumptions in any way that net out to nominal contributions for fiscal '18? And maybe related to that since we\u2019re talking qualitatively and not quantifying, does the lower end of guidance capture worse than expected trends in generics. So that if there were say no contributions from generics increasing in price or maybe the overall generics basket deflating more than your base case. Would you still be in the serious EPS range?","John Hammergren","Well, on the generics guide, we talked about a nominal contribution, economic contribution from generics with increase in price; so very much the same guide that we offered this time last year. And then also similarly a nominal economic contribution from brand to generic conversions; we expect to see in fiscal '18. Now, as to the range of the guide, that\u2019s always going to be driven by a mix of all of the variables that we\u2019ve been talking about and have led out in the press release. So it we wouldn\u2019t want to particularly so spend drop on one. But clearly that was nominal for both generic price inflation and generic conversions, I think, appropriately set out very modest expectations.","James Beer","And I would follow on to the last part of that question related to generic deflation. We\u2019ve talked about it in the past; it's not having much of an effect on our business; and part of our normal operating model when you think about the overall way we manage our generic portfolio; and the fact that we\u2019ve had deflation historically on a basket basis for a long time. And the deflation on our purchase of generics doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a deflation on the way we sell our market generics, and so that the two are distinct.","And the challenge we faced last year was not the rated deflation on what we paid for generics, the issue we faced last year was acceleration in the normally competitive market on generics to become even more competitive on the sell side. And that\u2019s what we faced in the back half of last year that we tried to discuss on previous calls. And to be clear, we don\u2019t anticipate that level of price erosion on the sell side of our generic portfolio. Going back to what we experienced in the last half of last year, we expect it to continue to be competitive, and not as volatile as we experienced.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Two part question, so probably the most common thing in my inbox is sort of trying to tease out the comparability of the updated guidance with what was expected versus discreet. And I could ask you to comment on street estimates. But if you can, James, maybe just help us think through the few components that most materially changed and just maybe repeated in terms of the prior year as we think relative to the updated guidance would be helpful. And secondary, a few of the assumptions you are talking about prior, like the deferred revenue piece. Is there anything else aside from that that changed materially that you communicated before? And then if you can help us just figure out what's the most sensitive point here. I mean there is clearly a ton of assumptions. And so when you think about which one you probably have -- not the least confident in, but may be as the widest interval of the outcome. What would you point to one or two things that maybe could be a little bit causing upper end or lower end of the range, more so than others?","James Beer","Well, obviously, there are a few moving parts here in the guide. I think about some of the bigger economic drivers that would -- to be a real different -- have some of the expectations out there. I point to our assumption around mid-single digits for branded manufacturer price increase. Yes, that is a lower assumption than that that we experienced in fiscal '17. But we think that\u2019s the prudent thing to do for the reasons we talked about in the prepared remarks. Think about the contribution from Rite Aid that we've been quite clear on.","The change in the adjusted earnings definition, there's a material impact there because up until today, we've been talking about that deferred revenue haircut that would impact the Change Healthcare income. And so now, we don't have to deal with that in adjusted earnings. And then the other thing I would say is our tax rate is probably at 27% lower than perhaps some expectations, because we've got a variety of drivers there that we're continuing to benefit from as we look forward into fiscal '18.","So in terms of user variability, while we'll obviously see what the branded manufacturers actually do during the year; and one of the other important assumptions we've made is around the lapping effect on the generic sale side, the lapping effect of what happened in the independent space last year; as John has been indicating, we're seeing less volatility there. Obviously, the hopeful situation we'll see how things play out in that part of the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next go to Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny","I know you provided a lot of details, particularly on the change in the non-GAAP adjustments. But I want to just make sure everything is level set again on that front just there are a lot of moving pieces. In terms of the change, specifically, related to the deferred revenue adjustments. I know a lot of companies that in the tax based exempts in the past. Is this just the way you guys are recognizing it going to be a one-time adjustment and then you\u2019ll go back to normalized margins for the Change business. Or is this going to be now part of the base as you take for interest in terms of thinking of how that's going to continue to flow through into your P&L given the 70% ownership structure?","James Beer","So in essence, we will not take that one-time decline in what would flow off the balance sheet into revenue. So we will not be impacted by what we now quantify as $200 million deferred revenue haircut effect. Obviously, that's part of the GAAP books, but that will not be showing up in our adjusted earnings.","John Hammergren","That's related to the transaction of McKesson and Change Healthcare, so it's not a comment on Change Healthcare's treatment of deferred revenue.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next go to David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen","Can you please just clarify, on the buy side of generics, are you seeing an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment. And then can you also comment on the hospital market, like Cardinal has evolved a lot of new capabilities, especially on the medical side. Are you seeing any sort of more aggressive competition within the facility space or not? Thanks.","John Hammergren","Well we, I think in the previous comment, I talked about generic deflation and how we believe it will continue and has for a long time. We don't really comment on the rate of deflation, because it's not a big factor that plays into the way our economics or our P&L operates. The deflation is typically not an issue that we have to guide on or that we miss or make on, it's something just part of our business model and we attempt to manage it. And this is the deflation as it relates to what we buy at. We don't necessarily comment on what we price the product at unless there's some kind of unusual circumstance, like we faced last year when we talked about generic price erosion in the marketplace, that's the sell side comment, that\u2019s not what we will be buy the product for.","The second part of your question was related to the hospital market. And we certainly have competed in the hospital market for a long-term and we used to be in the medical supply business and hospitals. And frankly found it difficult to compete with the likes of currently in the hospital market. But as it relates to the business that we retain in the hospital business, it's really in two categories. One, is in the physician office part of medical supply purchases in the hospital segment, where they own the doctors and ask for us to provide shipment to the smaller physician office facilities and practices that they own, we\u2019re very strong there and continue to be strong. And clearly in the pharmacy business of hospitals, we have a very strong value preposition and remain very strong there. And I never take competition lightly, but I don\u2019t believe the continued investment that Carlos is making in the medical surgical business necessarily will correlate to some change in competitive dynamics on the pharmacy side. But that's yet to be seen.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","I wanted to ask John like as we think about the competitiveness of the sell side that we saw last year. Where does your confidence on part of this lag and recur this year, especially as we had saw what rebate did this morning with bringing on Express Scripts?","John Hammergren","I can only speak from 20 plus years now, the experience here at McKesson in watching how the market pricing that has evolved and how our customers have come to us overtime. We continue to build out a very significant value proposition for our customers, particularly independent customers. They always get a competitive price from us, they always get a good deal from us, and our ability to source products, I think, is second to none. Having said that on occasion in the past and infrequently, we\u2019ll see a period of deflation on the sell side that has accelerated or price competition is accelerated and that\u2019s what we faced last year. It may have been seven or eight years between the last year that we experienced in the last time we experienced an event like that.","So could it happen every year, we sure it could happen and eventually you raise to the bottom and there is nothing more to give. But I don\u2019t forecast that just based on historical activity. As it relates to rebates activity, certainly, I can't speak to what incremental buying power they may garner as a result of bringing Express Scripts together with them. I don\u2019t feel we've been in a disadvantage, I don\u2019t feel we will be at a disadvantage. And I would also say it's not necessarily a direct correlation that if someone buys better that they determine that they will increase their level of discounts and pass it all back into the marketplace. So if that were to occur, if they bought better and their partners ended up buying better and then they decided to put it into the marketplace, we would have to respond and it would be a year similar to this year.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee","John, obviously you've given us an outlook here for fiscal '18, and it looks like that things are started to normalize. When we think about the future, you look at some of your peers here and they\u2019re deploying capital into areas of growth outside of let's say of the pharma distribution business. And here we are divesting as a chunk of our technology business into Change Healthcare. Can you talk about how you look at the longer term outlook for McKesson in terms of -- where do you think you\u2019re going to be looking to find growth in? And what should we think about the long term outlook for growth? Thanks.","John Hammergren","We like the pharmaceutical business and we like it globally, we certainly like in U.S., and we like in Canada and we like the medical supply business and the option side markets. We believe those markets and also inside medical are growing fast and will continue to grow at a nice pace as people move out of less convenient, more costly settings for their care and have a more value orientation and a more physician centric relationship perhaps. And we like the pharmaceutical business. You can see, as an industry, the pharmaceutical business continues to grow propelled by innovation and bio-similars and new treatments coming out. Clearly, the demographics in pharmaceutical usage is improving and we see that trend globally as well.","So I think we continue to feel good about our position. And you see us deploying capital, I think, in a very intelligently in high growth areas, not only in new markets where we can, I think, be a consolidator and a new service provider but also in our specialty acquisitions, you saw us buy Biologics last year -- and then Vantage, which are good acquisitions for us. We made a technology acquisition, called CoverMyMeds, which comes in with a different profit profile. And certainly now it is a good business on it' own that provides significant service to the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the pharmaceutical payers and the patients who are dependent on getting the drugs at the right time and at the right place at the pharmacy counter.","And clearly, we continue to make Canadian acquisition, another one of which was announced today. So I think we are well positioned; I think we\u2019ve got a right assets; I think these assets have a correlation across borders and across boundaries in our business; and we have synergy that we can take advantage of that in the end that delivers better value for our customers. So they can do a better job of clinical care and clearly do a better job of the economics associated with delivering that care.","I think that was our last question. I want to thank you operator and thank all of your on the call for your time today. We\u2019ve got a very solid operating plan for fiscal 2018. And I am certainly excited about the growth opportunities across McKesson.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig to answer a few questions about our upcoming events.","Craig Mercer","Thank you, John. We will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 15th. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and good bye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's current, periodic and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results: acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. As you've seen in the press release we issued this afternoon announcing our third quarter financial results, we incurred charges related to 2 items which had a negative impact on our reported results for the quarter. I'll come back to these items in just a moment.","I'd like to begin with 2 big headlines for the quarter. First, we had exceptional growth in our Distribution Solutions business where operating profits grew by 37% over the prior year. And we're also very excited to have secured the acquisition of Celesio through the agreements we announced last week.","First, I'll begin with a few comments about Celesio. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement with the Haniel Group to purchase their entire holding of Celesio common shares. In a separate and subsequent transaction, we also reached an agreement with an affiliate of Elliott management to purchase Celesio convertible bonds. The agreements with the Haniel Group and Elliott will result in McKesson achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. We expect to close these transactions on February 6, 2014.","We are extremely pleased to move forward with the acquisition of Celesio, and we look forward to bringing together the strengths of the McKesson and Celesio organizations to provide our customers with even more efficient delivery of health care products and services around the world. While the path to securing this acquisition was certainly not what we had originally expected, it would seem that the interested parties to this transaction continued to see the compelling strategic benefit of McKesson and Celesio uniting to form a global leader in health care services. I never lost sight of the value this transaction will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. That being said, we made it clear from the time we originally announced the transaction on our second quarter earnings call that we would need to achieve the 75% ownership threshold in order to fully realize the value and synergies we had outlined. We also made it clear that we would be disciplined stewards of our shareholders' capital, and I'm pleased we were able to accomplish both of these important objectives. James will update the key financial elements of the transaction and provide additional information on the immediate next steps, but let me take a moment here to make a few things clear.","First, our strategic rationale and key financial assumptions remain intact. Second, the combination of McKesson and Celesio will become the world's largest pharmaceutical supply chain company, and we'll be well-positioned to meet the increasing global nature of our industry.","I'm extremely proud of the global sourcing capability McKesson has built over many years. We've been able to deliver tremendous value through our strong manufacturer relationships and our knowledge of the health care supply chain. This acquisition keeps McKesson's expertise at the center of our strategy and deepens our relationships directly with our manufacturing partners.","And finally, McKesson has a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend, creating a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders.","Turning now to our results for the quarter. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver exceptional results, and our view of the full year operating performance of the business has improved from our previous expectations.","In our Technology Solutions segment, we continued to take actions to align our development efforts and resources to our customers' most important priorities and the realities of our marketplace. Our third quarter results include charges resulting from the restructuring actions related to the timing of our Horizon Clinicals software platform requirement to meet Meaningful Use 3.","Our third quarter results are also impacted by a significant increase in our tax reserves. As disclosed in our recent quarterly and annual SEC filings, we've been engaged in a tax dispute in Canada regarding the transfer pricing matter for the years 2003 through 2008. McKesson has been in litigation regarding the assessments received for the tax year 2003.","In late December, the Canadian Tax Court ruled against McKesson, and in January, we filed an appeal of this decision. While we believe the structure of our transfer pricing agreements were appropriate, we think it is prudent to record an increase in our current reserves for all Canadian open tax periods.","So overall, for the full year, our outlook for Distribution Solutions has improved. However, we have updated our guidance for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $8.05 to $8.20 for our fiscal 2014, which include the restructuring charges in our Technology business and an increase in our tax reserves, which combined total $0.70.","Before I turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results, I'll provide some highlights from both segments of our business. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver strong operating performance. In the third quarter, revenue grew 10%, and adjusted operating profit grew 37%.","Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 11% for the quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to experience price inflation in a relatively small subset of our generics portfolio. Consistent with the expectations we outlined in the second quarter, inflation in our fiscal third quarter moderated from what we had experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson and strong compliance to our generics programs and services, including strong growth in our OneStop and generic -- OneStop Generics program.","In summary, we had another quarter of great performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenues in Canada increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers.","Our Specialty business had another solid quarter of performance, and I'm pleased with the collaboration and innovation that's being driven between our physician partners and our specialty team. Our Medical-Surgical business had solid results for the third quarter. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of PSS World Medical, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the employees of the combined McKesson Medical-Surgical and PSS teams for the outstanding progress they have made in the integration of these 2 great businesses.","While we still have significant work ahead of us in the coming years to optimize our distribution network, I'm proud of the way our teams have come together to implement our strategy, all while remaining focused on taking care of our customers.","In summary, I'm pleased with the exceptional performance in our Distribution Solutions segment for the third quarter. We have leadership positions across all of our North American distribution businesses, including U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution, Canadian pharmaceutical distribution, community oncology distribution and services, and Medical-Surgical distribution, including physician office, home care and long-term care. And we're pleased to add a great new platform for growth on a more global scale through our acquisition of Celesio.","Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. In the third quarter, revenues grew by 6% to $784 million, and adjusted operating margins were 8.55%. While we are disappointed in the reported results in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter, it is important that we take action in response to the changes in the anticipated timeline for Meaningful Use 3 and to size our organization in Horizon Clinicals appropriately.","I would point out, as the timelines for Meaningful Use 3 are delayed, we must maintain a certain level of resources to support our customers as they prepare for this important implementation.","Another item which had an impact on our third quarter results and our outlook for the full year is that we had expected a recovery in demand, in particular in our Medical Imaging business. This recovery in demand has not yet materialized. You should expect to see us continue to take actions to align our organization and development efforts to our customers' most important priorities. Our customers are going through a significant change in the way they think about their business models going forward. McKesson will continue to focus on delivering solutions that help our customers drive better decisions through analytics and business intelligence, enabled connectivity and provide tools and services to support new risk-based and value-based reimbursement business models.","In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. The performance in our Distribution Solutions business is strong, and our outlook for the full year operating performance has improved from our previous expectations.","And our acquisition of Celesio positions us for leadership on a global scale. The combination of McKesson and Celesio is expected to have revenues in excess of $150 billion, approximately 81,000 employees worldwide and operations in more than 20 countries. We will deliver to approximately 120,000 pharmacy and hospital locations on a daily basis in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil, including more than 11,000 pharmacies that are either owned or part of a strategic banner or franchise network of community pharmacies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased by the continued strength in our operating results. We're also very pleased to be moving forward with Celesio and expect that this acquisition will build upon the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter consolidated financial results, provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook and outline the key financial aspects of our acquisition of Celesio.","As I review the third quarter, there are 3 aspects of our financial results that I would like to particularly bring to your attention. First and perhaps most important in thinking about our business going forward is the continued performance and strength within our Distribution Solutions segment. Second is a $122 million charge we recorded relating to a dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency, which we have described in our previous SEC filings. I will come back to this later in my remarks. And third, our $42 million in restructuring charges taken in our Technology Solutions segment, primarily related to our Horizon Clinicals software platform.","My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.45, which exclude 4 items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased to 10% for the quarter to $34.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased to 21% to $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued strength in our distribution business. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 13% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013.","For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3%. Other income year-over-year was slightly lower for the quarter at $5 million. Interest expense was approximately in line with the prior year at $59 million.","Now moving to taxes. As outlined in our recent filings, we have been engaged in a legal dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency regarding a transfer pricing matter that impacts the tax years 2003 through 2008. The tax court released its decision on this matter late in our third quarter. And earlier this month, we filed an appeal of that decision to the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada. During our review of the court's decision, we reevaluated our existing tax reserves for all open tax years and recorded adjustments increasing these reserves by $122 million. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be 36.5%, an increase from our previous estimate of 31%, driven by the current quarter Canadian tax reserve adjustment and a change in our mix of foreign and domestic income. Excluding the current quarter tax reserve adjustment, the adjusted full year tax rate would be 32.5%.","Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $339 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaled $1.45. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter were negatively impacted by $0.52 from the reserve adjustments related to the Canadian tax matter and by an additional $0.18 from the restructuring charges recorded at our Technology Solutions segment.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 234 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. We expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 234 million.","Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A.","Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $33.5 billion, primarily driven by market growth and more business from our existing customer base. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $24.9 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 1% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant-currency basis increased 12% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins.","Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 67% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. The combined business continues to perform very well, as we made progress on important integration activities.","Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 27% for the quarter on 10% revenue growth, resulting in a 65-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our third quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from continued favorable performance within our generics pharmaceutical business. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 19% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 234 basis points, an improvement of 46 basis points versus the prior year.","Based on our performance fiscal year-to-date, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 6% for the quarter to $784 million, primarily driven by our acquisitions. Now as I mentioned earlier, the third quarter results in Technology Solutions reflect certain business realignment and restructuring charges. Our businesses are continuously reviewing their outlook and strategic plans and allocating their resources to drive the best outcomes for our customers and our business. However, we do, on occasion, make decisions that have a more meaningful impact on our results. And therefore, we bring these to your attention.","This quarter, our results in Technology Solutions were impacted by $42 million in business realignment and restructuring charges, driven by delays in the Meaningful Use 3 timeline and the realignment of our development efforts primarily related to the Horizon Clinicals software platform. $31 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $11 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. As a result, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit decreased 4%, representing a 453-basis-point decline in our adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 12%, driven primarily by the acquisitions we made in the prior year, but also as a result of the impact of the current quarter restructuring charges.","Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $127 million, up 12% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 10% a year ago. Overall, third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 39% to $67 million, and the third quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 8.55%, a decrease of 636 basis points versus the prior year, driven largely by the charges I discussed earlier.","Based on the current quarter restructuring charges and the rationale for these charges that John reviewed earlier, we now expect to be at the lower end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of the mid-teens.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 25 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 32 days was flat year-over-year, and our days sales in payables remained at 46 days.","We generated cash flow from operations of $472 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect that cash flow from operations will total approximately $2 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with $1.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $296 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. We now expect full year internal capital spending to be approximately $400 million.","Now I'll turn to our outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter were specifically impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook.","First, the dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency had a negative impact of approximately $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter and the full year. Second, the current quarter adjustments to our tax reserves and our change in income mix also drove an increase in our updated full year adjusted tax rate to 36.5% from our prior estimate of 31%. And third, the Technology Solutions charges lowered our adjusted earnings by approximately $0.18 per diluted share this quarter.","As a result of these 3 items, we are updating our adjusted earnings guidance to a range of between $8.05 and $8.20. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. We expect that the results from our acquisition of Celesio will not have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results. In addition, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.55 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.23 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.71 to $0.77.","Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. McKesson expects to fund a portion of the transaction with offshore cash and has a bridge financing facility in place to fund the balance of the purchase price. As we consider our permanent financing plans, we remain committed to maintaining our status as an investment grade-rated company. We will begin to consolidate the financial results of Celesio during our fourth quarter, ending March 31, 2014, and our earnings will reflect [indiscernible] share of Celesio's earnings, although as I mentioned, we do not expect the acquisition will have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results.","After the expected close of our agreements with the Haniel family and Elliott on February 6, 2014, we will exceed 75% ownership of Celesio's shares on a fully diluted basis. We plan to launch a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that we will have operational control of Celesio late in the first half of our fiscal 2015.","Just to remind you, getting to operating control of Celesio, also known as a domination in Germany, is the point in time when we expect to begin executing on our synergy business case. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive on an adjusted earnings basis in the first 12 months following the completion of the transactions with the Haniel family and Elliott. This range, however, assumes 100% ownership of the outstanding common shares of Celesio and thus will have to be adjusted in line with our actual ownership stake in Celesio at different points in time over the coming months. Overall, our assumptions for accretion and synergies from this acquisition remain unchanged.","In summary, we recorded 3 very strong quarters this year, and we are excited to move forward with our acquisition of Celesio and expect the transaction to deliver tremendous value to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders in the years ahead.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks. It seems you suggested that maybe the generic inflation moderated a little bit in fiscal 3Q versus 2Q, but yet the magnitude of the beats out of the pharmaceutical segment continue to get bigger. And so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more, give us a little bit more color, about maybe what in the business maybe did much better than you would have thought given that moderating inflation -- generic inflation?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we were really pleased with the performance of the Distribution Solutions segment in the quarter, and we continue to have strength, really, across the board. You saw nice revenue growth in the business. Clearly, the PSS integration is going well for us, which has been additive to the performance in that business, but the real strength is really coming still out of our generics business. Our OneStop revenues were up nicely. The share of wallet we're getting from our customers who are relying more and more on our generic capabilities and now depending on us to source the right products at the right price for them has been very helpful. And clearly, the position we have with those manufacturers continues to improve. I think we've really built very positive, trusting relationships. And inflation continues to be an important part. So it's too early to call it trend change in generic inflation, but clearly, some moderation has occurred and it's been helpful. And it's still positive relative to our original expectations.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe just one quick follow-up. If I look at sort of what you're implying now for the fourth quarter based on your updated guidance, it looks like about $2.26 to $2.41 in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is lower than consensus. And the reason I bring it up is because on one of your competitors' conference calls, they seem to suggest that there were some price inflation that was maybe moved from the March quarter into the December quarter, and so I'm kind of wondering, was there anything that might have been -- that you might have recognized a little bit earlier than you otherwise would have? Is there any difference in the typical seasonality of these 2 quarters?","John H. Hammergren","I don't think we saw a lot of changes in the way that branded manufacturers behaved in our portfolio, the way we've established our agreements. Having said that, there may have been some slight move into our third quarter and out of our fourth quarter. I think that our -- we clearly believe that the inflation moderation is going to continue as we look into our fourth quarter, and we also have some follow-on expense in our MTS segment, as I talked about in our -- in my prepared comments. This Meaningful Use 3 thing for us is -- it was a real critical change. It pushed out our customers' implementation and we were able to, through the charge, reduce a significant amount of the investment we had sitting there, waiting to do these service implementations with our customers. But there is still remaining investment built in services and in R&D as we try to prepare ourselves for whenever the MU3 thing gets put in place for us. So I think it's a combination of sort of that moderation on the generics side to some degree in the fourth quarter, as well as the MTS business will have this kind of follow-on expense associated with MU3 and some other things that we've got going on there.","James A. Beer","The other thing I would just add to that is, of course, tax rate that I mentioned for the full year. We are looking at that 36.5% tax rate. So you have to bear that in mind as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you share with us kind of like what has been the feedback from your customers in the acquisition of Celesio? And I know, John, you talk about increasing generic wallet of customers. But are you seeing increased appetite from customers to historically source the bulk of their generics directly from manufacturers to strategically do more with McKesson?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we've been actively working for almost a decade on helping our customers realize the value, both from our sourcing, as well as our logistics efforts, and we believe that we are sourcing as well now as almost any one, and Celesio is going to help us improve even more, as we add that volume. And in particular, the retail footprint that, that brings along with it. I think the dynamic with our customers is also a focus on how to get supply chain efficiency. And","[Audio Gap]","wholesale channel is not -- has not proven to be the most logistically favorable way to do it. There's added costs on not only the buying and procurement side, but you could also certainly envision the increment of cost when it goes into our customers' warehouses, and then they have to handle the product and get it back out, when we're already in those stores every day, anyway, with the delivery of the other product that we have been selling them. So I think there's an increased appreciation at the executive level within our customers to look at those costs and to look also at the changing global world of generic sourcing and increased interest in focusing on McKesson. And I think what's great about the relationship that we've created here with the acquisition of Celesio, is it allows us to continue to have tremendous transparency into the supply chain. It gives us really total control of our own destiny, and it allows us to maintain those close partnerships with our manufacturing partners so that we can continue to have visibility to the opportunity, bring those opportunities to our customers and present them in a way that is compelling relative to them moving their internal sourcing of generics over to McKesson.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the one follow-up is regarding the Ranbaxy plant import ban. How do you view the ban? How does it impact your view of generic price inflation? I know that you talked about some moderation, but does that -- could that change the trends?","John H. Hammergren","I guess, Ricky, I would remind you that McKesson has a very large generics portfolio consisting of thousands of products. And to put this inflation thing into context, the inflation is really coming from a very small subset of our total portfolio of products and a small subset of the manufacturers. With regards to Ranbaxy, I believe the industry is well aware of the work the FDA has been doing. They've increased their funding and their staffing to do critical inspections, and although I certainly feel bad for the Ranbaxy folks relative to this, I think McKesson is aware of this increased scrutiny and trying to make sure that we are availing ourselves of a wide enough supply chain so that we have access to the products. And I do not expect any of the recent situation with one of the Ranbaxy plants in India to have an impact on our delivery to our customers, nor an impact on our view of inflation going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just curious, we get a lot of questions on the generics and the price inflation and the impact and sort of how it flows through. Can you help us understand a little bit the extent to which you're seeing benefits from more -- by whole type pricing? Or is it that the same percentage spread on a bigger dollar amount gives you some more earnings? And I guess where I'm going with it is, to what extent, when price inflation moderates -- is it just sort of lack of upside? Or do you actually have to -- a negative that you have to overcome year-over-year because the earnings actually get lower in dollars?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we've seen a trend over time with generic pricing. It used to be a deflationary headwind we had to deal with year-on-year. And as that began to moderate, it clearly made the year-on-year effect easier. With an inflation environment like we experienced this year, clearly, it was a surprise to us that this would occur to the magnitude that it has. And as you think about our thinking going forward, it could provide a headwind for us, depending on what your view of ongoing generic inflation might be. Clearly, the offsets to that will be to get more and more folks buying off of our generic portfolio. Additional offsets will be the power of what we're doing with Northstar and our sourcing there. And clearly, our global sourcing initiatives are going to get additional fuel or accelerant as we put the Celesio teams together with the McKesson teams to approach the market on a global basis. And also, as you think about FY '13, we have a brand-to-generic trend that moves in our favor again. This was really the lull year for generic conversions, and I think, as you think about next year, we'll see that pick back up again.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Right. Right. And I have a follow-up to that actually. I think you started to mention it. You've said for a few quarters now that you're seeing more generics business from your existing customers. Can you frame that potential in terms of what's left on the table there, in any way, for us to get an understanding of where you've been and maybe how much more there is to go if more and more customers were, in fact, to move more of their business to you?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we have a great book of business, and we have been able, over the years, to take a great deal of the responsibility for delivering generics to our independents on -- is one of our key requirements. As you know, Tom, you've been following us for some time, we've been moving up the food chain with bigger and bigger customers testing us from a generic perspective and coming to the conclusion that we do in fact do the best job for them relative to generic pricing and generic service and generic availability. I think that, that movement is continuing. Our very largest customers still purchase generics on their own. And clearly, that would be a very large opportunity for us as we continue to build a compelling vision for what that might mean for them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was curious just in terms of the cash flow and sort of where we are. It seems like it's pretty back half -- 4Q weighted for the year. How did that sort impact how you're thinking about the financing mix for Celesio? Obviously, we saw you raise the bridge, but we're -- I'm just curious in terms of -- in the new or old, I guess, guidance assumption, what is the sort of backbone behind that just in terms of percent from new debt versus cash on hand? Because, obviously, you have a portion in Europe.","James A. Beer","Yes. Certainly, the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong operating cash flow quarter for us, in part as a result of the timing of a lot of the brand price increases that we traditionally see. So in terms of the financing for Celesio, we have the view that we would have at least $1 billion or so of cash available offshore, and then we would obviously draw on the bridge for the balance of our needs, those needs, of course, are dependent upon the timing of the remaining 25% or so of the Celesio shares that we acquire. So we'll see how we play out in terms of that remaining 1\/4 or so of the shares. That will help us define the eventual amount of permanent debt that we would put in place once we pay off the bridge.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe, John, you touched upon obviously over time, as these generic relationships develop, the potential to touch more of your large customers. But I'm curious, with all the new relationships in industry, what are you seeing from the independents, which has obviously been a core strength of yours for years? And how are they sort of reacting to all of these new arrangements and sort of the potential for them to possibly participate in new services? I guess this is now going to be true for you both here and in Europe.","John H. Hammergren","The independents in both Europe and here in the United States have been very positive about the announced Celesio acquisition, and now they're even more positive on the view that it's going to close here in a few weeks. And I think they believe that not only will they be able to enjoy continued great service and price on generics, but there are obviously tremendous retail experience that comes with Celesio, through the management of Lloyds Pharmacies, as well as the many banner stores that they support throughout Europe to continue to find ways to bundle our capabilities effectively for our independent customers. I'd also point out that none of our customers in Europe or here see the merger of McKesson and Celesio as a conflict of interest on their side. They don't feel threatened by it. They don't see it as something that's against their ultimate goals, and they don't see it as a competitive action in any way. So I think from a discussion perspective, we don't have any conflict of interest relative to what our motives are. And I think they continue to look at this in a favorable way, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A lot of talk today about generic inflation. Can you maybe just give us any color as far as brand price inflation you saw in the quarter and expectations for the March quarter? We've heard some talk about the fact that some things may have been pulled into the December quarter. Did you see something similar? And how should we think about it in the March quarter?","John H. Hammergren","I would say that our view in the quarter was pretty consistent with our going-in thoughts as we developed our plans for the year. So I -- given that it hasn't been brought to my attention and when I asked the question to our team, there might have been some nominal changes in behavior. But as a portfolio, the price really came in close to what our expectations were.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, in Canada, obviously you called it out, it was up 12%. You talked about customer, as well as market growth. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that came from market growth? Are you seeing substantially more market growth there than we're seeing in the U.S.? And if so, what are the key drivers to that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, we have picked up a bunch of new customers in Canada, and we've been very selective on those new relationships. One of our competitors exited Canada through the sale of their business to another competitor in Canada, and some of the customers that were serviced by that competitor were open to a conversation with McKesson. And as a result, we've been able to grow our business. I might also say that our specialty business in Canada, which we believe is market-leading, continues to grow very nicely. And so we've been encouraged by that continued penetration in that part of our book.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there a way to look at the 12%, how much came from the new customers versus the overall market in Canada?","John H. Hammergren","It's probably difficult to parse out, Lisa. There are public numbers on market growth rates in Canada, but I think, clearly, we believe that we've had a significant increase in revenue as a result of our customer wins in the Canadian marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just have a quick question on the March quarter as well. If I'm doing the math right, I think the implied fourth quarter guidance is $2.26 to $2.41 and straight to $2.46 right now. But again, with all the details in the press release and the commentary on the call, is there anything that's sort of one-time-ish in nature that you're including in the upcoming March quarter that's kind of baked within that quarterly guidance in particular? Or is that sort of more of a clean range the way things stand right now, just in relation to taxes or IT charges or even charges tied to Celesio as well?","James A. Beer","No. There's nothing that we're implying as to the fourth quarter or one-time nature or anything like that. Really, the 3 drivers I would ask you to really focus are obviously the Canada tax, $0.52; the technology charges of $0.18; and then the impact of the tax run rate, which is both partly driven by that Canada tax item, but also as a result of a change in our income mix with distribution business representing a greater proportion of the total profitability of McKesson.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","John, obviously we've talked a bit about your generics program here. And when you look at sort of the partnerships that have formed, yours is obviously a little different because you're basically owning Celesio. But as you think in the future and serving [ph] your large customers, do you envision more that they'll just join your -- they'll just become a customer of your OneStop program? Or could it end up being where you're partnering more in a JV format? Like how do you envision -- what would be your preferred route, and how would you kind of see it? Or do you even see the need to do that?","John H. Hammergren","Charles, that's a good question. I think the way I think about it is that the -- first of all, you see through these combinations that scale really matters and that wholesalers really matter. We are an integral part, even in the largest customer set, of the value proposition and the service offering that's brought to the marketplace. So I think the industry overall and wholesaling has done a very good job of continuing to add significant value. And changing our model over time so we remain vibrant and viable and in the middle of a very important industry and earn our position every day. I would say, relative to structures, we have not had great success at McKesson creating joint ventures that are sustainable, that -- where interests are always combined and unified. And usually, we end up with a situation where they collapse under their own complexity or they have some problem with one venture partner trying to optimize against another. So we're not really inclined to enter joint ventures, although I'd say that -- with the caveat of clearly, we'll listen to the opportunity and make a decision. I would say that with respect to our largest customers, we hope to continue to evolve our value proposition so that the economics that are afforded to them through our OneStop program or through custom-developed programs, that they'll buy off of our portfolio and that, that transaction will make sense for us and for them without the complexity of some type of a venture structure which could be difficult to manage.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And if I can just follow up, your largest customers that do buy direct -- I mean, we generally assume that they buy all the generics direct. Is that really the case? Or is that they're buying sort of high-value generics directly and maybe low-value generics through you?","John H. Hammergren","I can only speak for McKesson's large customers. I would say that without exception, they all buy some generics from us. Given the frequency with which we deliver to the stores, our position has always been to help our customers from a service perspective. Clearly, many of them have their own warehouses and do their own buying as well for certain sets of products. And how they reach a decision as to which they buy for themselves and which they buy through us may not be totally transparent to us. I would assume it would usually be from an economic perspective, they would make that decision. Our job is to wrap the value proposition of our complete relationship with the customer, which should include brand, generic, our service offering, our automation systems, our warehousing capabilities, to make it compelling for them to discontinue their own purchasing. And we've been effective at doing that all the way up to our largest customers. And I think that it's our responsibility to continue to evolve our programs so we can earn the privilege of serving their needs from a generic perspective in a more holistic way.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, first one for you is can you detail for us, with the generic inflation that's been going on, how is Northstar leveraged to that? So has that been an excess margin opportunity for Northstar? And maybe the opportunities for Northstar in Europe?","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, George, for the question. Northstar clearly is around the globe looking at opportunities to bring product into our supply chain. And I think that the visibility we get through Northstar enhances our view of the opportunities that exist globally for us, as well as some of the challenges that may exist, whether it's plant closures, limited supply of raw materials or other issues that may come along. And I think that Northstar experience helps inform all of McKesson from a sourcing perspective in a very positive way. We have launched a variant of Northstar into Canada with success, and that product continues to build its position in Canada, that product line. And I believe, and so do our new partners at Celesio, that there are opportunities to explore with our generic portfolio in Europe. And clearly, Northstar will be a part of that.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, James, maybe just 2 quick housekeeping questions. I want to make sure I heard things right. With the 36.5% tax rate you mentioned, was that for the fourth quarter? Or is that what we expected the full year rate to be?","James A. Beer","Yes, that's the rate for the full year, and that includes the impact of the Canadian tax matter that I talked about.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- as you guys launch the tender process for the remainder of Celesio, how long does that tender process go on for? And then maybe just a very simple explanation of next steps?","James A. Beer","Yes. The tender process we're doing -- envisage taking about 4 weeks, and then you'd have an additional 2-week period, very similar to actually the structure of the original tender, whereby additional people could tender their shares during that extra 2-week period. And then we have already issued our intent to go through a domination hearing. That will take some time. There are a few steps that we have to go through to be able to get to that hearing. First of all, we have to go through a valuation process. And then we also have to give 6 weeks' notice to call an annual general meeting at which the domination process would be heard. So that will take a few months, but we would still expect to be on track to reach domination towards the end of the first half of our fiscal 2015. And of course, it's at that point in time where we can really start work on the synergy case. That's the point of time in which we have operating control of Celesio.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","John, can you touch on how simple or perhaps complex it might be for the combined buying power of both McKesson and Celesio to operate across borders? Will that be a fairly simple process? And then can you also touch on the pricing environment in Germany?","John H. Hammergren","Thank you, David, for the questions. I think that it's probably difficult to characterize the 14 countries in Celesio's book in one way. I would say it really matters which country you're thinking about relative to the way generics are purchased today, how they're contracted for, whether the payers are involved or the government is involved. I would say that we've carefully mapped out the positions by country, by manufacturers. We understand where we think these synergies might fall for us. And clearly, our guidance to synergies and how we talked about it when we first announced the deal, all of those factors remain in place. So I think that -- we believe there are places where we can go across the borders with a more unified approach. And I'm sorry, David, I forgot the second question you asked.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then just in Germany, the pricing environment in Germany. Any challenge there? Any headwinds?","John H. Hammergren","That's another good question. Our German operation or the German operation under Celesio in that market has -- there has been public discussion about the wholesaling pricing in that market, just to be clear about what pricing -- at least I think I'm talking about. The wholesalers in that market have been in a competitive battle with each other for some time. I think that the Celesio people, on their last public conference call, characterized it as stabilizing but not improving. I don't think I want to make any additional comment other than that. But clearly, that's what their view was the last time they spoke publicly about it.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then I saw you had a press release on a relationship with RedBrick. Can you maybe just comment on what that will provide to McKesson's clients?","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's in our Technology business, and I have to say, it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. We do think it's important. We've been impressed with what the Redbrick people have to provide, but it won't really be anything material for McKesson at our scale.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just understanding that we'll get formal guidance next quarter, I was wondering, John, maybe if you could share a little bit how you're thinking about the operating margin range, considering this year sounds like we'll be towards the upper end of the 200- to 250-basis-point range. Just trying to get a sense of how much of the drivers of the performance or outperformance this year do you think directionally are sustainable as we think about next fiscal year. And this is x Celesio, of course?","John H. Hammergren","Sure, Robert. Thank you for the question. We have not contemplated our guidance for next year yet. As you know, we'll do that when we report our fourth quarter results in April. I believe that -- our view, however, as a company is that margin expansion is a priority. And clearly, as you see the P&L flow this quarter, we like to grow revenues in line with the market, or maybe faster if we can get a bigger share of our customer's spend, which is what we've been focused on with our generics. We like to get a very positive drop to our gross profit lines by managing our pricing carefully in the marketplace. So we are not giving it all away. And then clearly, we want to manage our expenses very carefully as well so that we can drop it to the bottom line. And that's what delivers a great business and a great business model. I see no reason to believe that we can't continue to focus on gross margin as a top priority. I don't see any negative mix change occurring in our business, and I think generics continue to be a propellant across the board if you think about our sourcing. And if you think about next year, we have another brand-to-conversion cycle, which will be helpful to us from a margin expansion perspective. It remains a priority. And as we -- hopefully, as I keep telling Paul Julian, when you get past the 250, we'll come up with a new goal for you, which he's always excited to discuss.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. I guess just if I could flip one in on Medical, not to be lost, obviously, good results there as well this quarter. Understanding PSS has been a big part of the contribution of growth this fiscal year, we start to lap that next quarter. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you're seeing on underlying growth within the medical business and what your expectations might be in that segment going forward?","John H. Hammergren","I'm glad you brought up PSS. We have just a terrific franchise -- or I should say Med-Surg. We just have a terrific franchise and completing the PSS acquisition was an important step to market leadership in almost all -- in fact, all of the segments that we serve now in Medical. That integration is going very well. You saw the strength in the revenue, but I believe that those businesses' underlying growth, setting aside the acquisition, are all growing at or above the marketplace. And those are places where our value proposition really stands unique, and I think we have the ability to continue to grow share in home care, long-term care and our physician office business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, how quickly can you proceed with an acquisition strategy for Celesio to really expand that platform? Do you have to wait a couple of years? Or is it something instantaneously you can put in place?","John H. Hammergren","An acquisition on top of Celesio, is that what you were asking?","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, building out the European or Latin American markets, wherever you might choose to go.","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's probably a little premature for me to speculate on it, given that -- I think we need to do a close diagnostic on what position we are in, in each one of these markets and how well we're positioned to take on additional work in those markets. Celesio is a composite of 14 countries that are all managed in a very discreet way, and I would think each one of these countries should provide additional opportunities. So we have both an execution challenge we'd have to understand if we were to bring on additional acquisitions. And clearly, we have a balance sheet constraint that we've put in place that says we're not going to lose our investment grade, and we're going to manage our cash flow very carefully. So with those 2 caveats, I think we're open to acquisitions, into doing things, but we're not going to do it in a way that disturbs our integration plans at Celesio, and we're not going to do it in a way that would integrate -- or risk our investment grade rating.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","John H. Hammergren","Great. Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for being on the call today. I'm really pleased with the operating performance of our business and excited about the future and our acquisition of Celesio. We're bringing on a great management team, a great group of employees and a great asset that will help us really build our company as we go forward. And I look forward to welcoming those teams as I travel throughout Europe in the next several months. This platform is important to us, and it's important to our customers.","I'm now going to hand the call off to Erin for her upcoming review of upcoming events.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On February 25, we will present at the Citi Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in early May. Thank you, and goodbye.","Operator","And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation."],"14286":["McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Holly Weiss - SVP, IR","Brian Tyler - CEO","Britt Vitalone - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Lisa Gill - JP Morgan","Eric Coldwell - Robert W.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.","Holly Weiss","Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our Web site at investor.mckesson.com.","With that, let me turn it over to Brian.","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Holly, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. We're please today to be able to report a strong start to our fiscal year 2020. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $55 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, ahead of our original expectations.","On our fourth quarter call, in May, I discussed that we were entering the fiscal year with positive momentum. And I feel really good about this underpinning our first quarter results. We're seeing healthy growth across many parts of our business, which is a direct result of the actions we have been and are taking to execute on our strategic imperatives, which are enabling us to become a more focused and efficient company. And our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the flexibility to deploy capital that can differentiate McKesson and create shareholder value. As a result of our first quarter performance, combined with our confidence in the business as we look ahead, we're raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $14.00 to $14.60. This is from our previous range of $13.85 to $14.45.","Now turning to the business, I'll summarize our first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Britt to elaborate. The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions had a good start to the year, driven by our broad set of specialty biopharmaceutical capabilities focused on both providers and manufacturers. I'm particularly pleased as this demonstrates the progress we're making on one of our three key strategic imperatives. We continue to see biopharma dynamics that are trending in line with our annual guide of mid single-digit price increases on branded drugs. In addition, given our presence in the provider space and particularly oncology, where we are well positioned as biosimilars continue to become prevalent.","Talking about generics for a moment, similar to the last few quarters, our ClarusONE sourcing platform continues to deliver yield in line with our expectations. With its scale, we're able to buy at prices that are competitive with our peers. On the sell side, we continue to see a market that is competitive but stable.","A few comments on Europe, our U.K. retail business performance was impacted primarily by temporary wide NHS underfunding which we believe should improve in the second-half, and to a lesser extent volume weakness. Performance in the other European countries was not enough to fully offset these challenges. Britt will speak to the expected full-year impact. Before I address the NHS more specifically, let me remind you of the actions we're previously taken in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. With new leadership at the helm, we're making solid progress towards further rationalizing our store footprint and streamlining our back office functions. And we continue to evaluate our cost structure as we do in all our businesses.","Turning back to the NHS, we're pleased by recent announcements, first, to increase the retail tariff, beginning in August. And we would expect to see further upward revisions in tariff later in the year, which should make up partially for any underfunding. The NHS also announced the new five-year Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework. This framework brings greater clarity and long-term certainty by maintaining the current level of industry funding for community pharmacies for the next five years. While certain elements of the funding allocation are yet to be fully defined and could evolve over the five-year time horizon, we view this as an incrementally positive development for our European business. McKesson remains active in its support of and direct discussions with the U.K. government on the future of community pharmacy and healthcare in the U.K.","Turning to MedSurg, our Medical-Surgical business continues to generate above-market strong organic growth with its focus on delivering care and low-cost patient setting, and we have now lapped the Medical Specialties Distributor or MSD acquisition, which is delivering results in line with our expectations. We saw good growth across multiple markets and product categories, including Lab, Pharmaceutical, and McKesson Private Label. The non-acute space continues to be an encouraging area for us. Like others in healthcare, we continue to see care shift to these non-acute settings where we currently operate. With investments such as MSD and our new technology in our distribution centers, we're continuing to expand our services to these providers and to their patients.","Turning to the other segment, which primarily consists of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS, and our investment in Change Healthcare, we see improving prescription trends in our owned Canadian retail business which reflects our focus on the retail customer experience. We've made investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats. With strengthening fundamentals, we believe this can reinforce the role that community pharmacy plays in Canadian healthcare. Within MRxTS, we continue to see good growth in CoverMyMeds and the RelayHealth Pharmacy, driven by unique technology offerings that resonate with both our retail and biopharma partners. We continue to make investments in this business to position us for future growth.","Change Healthcare achieved an important milestone with the completion of its initial public offering, in June. Britt will speak more about this and what we can expect going forward. We're also investing in platforms that enhance our data and analytics capabilities. We realized benefits across the enterprise in the first quarter, and we expect to see expanding benefit in the future.","I now want to touch upon drug pricing reform and the policy landscape. I had the opportunity recently to spend a few days in Washington, D.C. McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policymakers to address issues that may impact patients, our industry, and community-based pharmacy and medical practices, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality, and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. These objectives align with the administration's goals, and we're committed to continuing the dialogue with policymakers and industry partners on sound, sustainable, and pragmatic solutions. It remains a dynamic environment, yet we remain confident in McKesson's path forward.","The critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally. Let me address two of the most recent developments. The Senate Finance Committee published a package of measures last week. We anticipate there might be further modifications as the package makes its way through the legislative process. So at this point we're not in a position to go into great detail on specific provisions. However, we will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that these reforms support the efficiency, sustainability, and security of the supply chain as we seek to improve cost, quality, and access.","Finally, earlier today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, announced a Safe Importation Action Plan. Given how recent this announcement is we haven't yet had the full time we'd like to digest or study this plan, but maybe a few just quick preliminary thoughts. Obviously McKesson's presence in both U.S. and Canada gives us a unique perspective on supply chain considerations and the impact to stakeholders and patients as we navigate this complex question of importation. There are legitimate concerns that importation could potentially introduce counterfeit or fraudulent products into the U.S.","Importantly, we have a primary responsibility to maintain a safe, secure, and efficient supply chain, and to ensure that we confirm to FDA safety and efficacy standards in addition to the safeguards put in place by the 2013 passage of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. These objectives are paramount as we evaluate the two pathways announced in today's plan.","Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on the opioid epidemic. We continue to believe distributors are being disproportionally targeted given our important but limited role in the supply chain. Filling orders from licensed pharmacies who are in turn filling prescriptions written by licensed healthcare providers, any suggestion that McKesson drove demand for opioids in this country would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of our role as a distributor. We will continue to fight that mischaracterization in the multiple venues, both state and federal, where lawsuits have been filed by thousands of plaintiffs. These are clearly novel, complex, and unprecedented claims that must be navigated.","We remain deeply concerned about the impact of this crisis on families and communities across the U.S., and are passionately committed to using McKesson's capabilities to be part of the solutions. This includes partnering with government, industry, social institutions, and other players to help bring this crisis to an end. I've spoken about it before, but let me remind you of the investments we've made and continue to make in our programs, our processes, our technologies dedicated to preventing diversion, and our corporate initiatives, announced last spring, to help [technical difficulty] the epidemic.","Those include educating the pharmacies and hospital to whom we deliver about the importance of compliance with the EA Regulation, creating a nationwide clinical alerts system that uses patient prescription history to identify patients at risk of opioid overuse, abuse, addiction or misuse, and actively advocating for public policies that will help address the opioid epidemic.","In addition, we contributed $100 million to establish the foundation for opioid response efforts a foundation dedicated solely to driving solutions to the epidemic. I'm proud of our teams and our team members who ensure the safety and security of our supply chain day-in day-out.","With that, let me turn the call over to Britt.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. McKesson posted another solid quarter and strong start to fiscal 2020. Slides on reviewing with you this afternoon are posted to the Investors section of our website and include our full-year fiscal 2020 guidance assumptions. Today we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share ahead of our original expectations and we're raising the full-year fiscal '20 outlook by $0.15 to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share from our previous outlook of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share.","Let's move right to our first quarter results. Our first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share were up 14% year-over-year driven by strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, Medical-Surgical Solutions and our MRxTS businesses. A lower share count higher contribution from our equity investment in Change Healthcare, a one-time gain from investment activities and expense timing. These items were partially offset by the anticipated year-over-year increase in opioid litigation and technology costs which we outlined with our initial outlook in May. Also had a lower profit contribution from the Europe segment and a higher adjusted tax rate.","Let me start with the details of our consolidated results, which can be found on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by a few key operational items. Within our Medical-Surgical business, the contribution from the MSD acquisition, which we have now lapped, and above market growth in pharmaceutical products, volume growth across our MRxTS offerings, and growth in our specialty provider solutions business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, these items were partially offset by foreign currency effects and lower retail pharmacy margins in the U.K.","First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 1% year-over-year partially driven by the acquisition of MSD in the prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $933 million for the quarter, 9% above the prior year. Interest expense was $56 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower commercial paper balances.","Our adjusted tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter, mainly driven by our mix of business. We continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year.","Income attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $625 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $189 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year.","Next, I'll discuss our segment results, which can be found on slides five through eight, and let's start -- I'd like to start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. First quarter revenues were $44.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven by solid contributions from our largest retail national pharmacy customer's, growth across our specialty businesses and continued solid performance within our health systems segment partially offset by branded to generic conversions.","Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 11% to $600 million primarily due to strong growth in our specialty businesses continued strong performance by our sourcing operations and the lapping of prior year opioid-related expenses.","As a reminder, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act in the first quarter of McKesson's fiscal 2019. Although the Act was being challenged in court, we recorded an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results of $15 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment which accounted for the estimated portion of the annual assessment. This legislation was later ruled unconstitutional and the approval was reversed in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 136 basis points, an increase of four basis points. Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions, first quarter revenues were down 3% year-over-year to $6.7 billion.","On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 3% driven by our market growth in the distribution wholesale business. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 50% to $37 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly due to the weak retail pharmacy environment in the U.K. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 50 basis points on an FX adjusted basis, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our first quarter results were lower than expectations resulting from weak retail pharmacy margins in the U.K. due to industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. We anticipate this underfunding will modestly improve in the second-half of fiscal 2020.","As Brian discussed earlier in fiscal 2019, we took actions in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. These actions included further store rationalization and cost actions. We continue to execute against these restructuring actions as we further evaluate our cost position. As a result of the U.K. outlook, we now expect European segment adjusted operating profit growth to be on the low end of our original assumption of low to mid single digit percent growth.","Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, 12% year-over-year. Excluding the MSD acquisition which closed on June 1 of 2018, segment revenue increased 4% driven by growth in our primary care and Extended Care business including strength in pharmaceutical products and our home delivery business.","Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 27% to $159 million driven by organic growth in contribution from the MSD acquisition. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 836 basis points an increase of 102 basis points due to market growth and cost management.","Finishing our business review with other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter down 1% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 2% primarily by growth in our MRxTS business. Other adjusted operating profit increased 31% to $279 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly driven by increased equity income from our investment in Change Healthcare and continued strength in our MRxTS business.","Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $108 million for the quarter as compared to $64 million in the prior period. Let me take a minute and update you on our equity investments in Change Healthcare.","On June 27 of 2019, Change Healthcare began trading on the NASDAQ. This was an important milestone for Change Healthcare, well Change Healthcare is now a publicly traded company McKesson will continue to report the equity income from our interests in Change Healthcare based on our equity ownership percentage and we will continue to report Change Healthcare results on a one-month lag. As a result of the IPO, McKesson's equity ownership in Change Healthcare is approximately 58.5% effective beginning with McKesson's second quarter.","When taking into account McKesson's new equity ownership percentage as well as Change Healthcare's repayment of long-term debt following the completion of its IPO, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be unchanged from the prior range of $250 million to $270 million which it assumes 70% ownership throughout fiscal 2020.","I would point out that our adjusted equity interest assumption for Change Healthcare as well as our future results and commentary on Change Healthcare will be specific to McKesson's ownership interest based on McKesson definition of adjusted earnings, our equity ownership percentage in Change Healthcare and the period from which we are reporting which again will be on a one-month lag. Any questions related to the operating performance or the outlook for Change Healthcare will be addressed by the change management team. The IPO was an important next step in McKesson's efforts to unlock value for our shareholders as we progress towards exiting our investment and Change Healthcare in a tax efficient manner.","As we've detailed in the past, there are lockup periods in other milestones, which must be met prior to our exit, which include first the customary six month lockup period following the IPO, then Blackstone or equity partner and Change Healthcare has the opportunity to do a secondary offering, covering up to a three month period, falling that there would be a three month lockup period.","Given all of these factors, our exit could extend to a period of 12 to 18 months. However, depending on the necessity of certain milestones, we may have the opportunity to exit by the end of our fiscal 2020. We will provide updates as we progress through the respective lockup periods then milestones, as we move closer to our eventual exit.","Moving out of corporate expenses, McKesson recorded a $137 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the first quarter, an increase of 44% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs, and the overall timing of technology investments in the fiscal year, partially offset by a one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter of approximately $0.10. As it relates to opioid-related litigation costs McKesson recorded $36 million in expenses in the first quarter. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs will be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020. Based on the one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter, we now anticipate corporate expenses to be on the low-end of the original assumption of $725 million to $775 million.","Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow $162 million. This performance was ahead of our expectations. I would remind you the cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter impacted by timing, including the day and a week that marks the close of a quarter.","We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2020. Investment in growth opportunities remains a key priority for McKesson. During the quarter, we made $111 million of capital expenditures and spent $46 million on acquisitions. We continue to focus on internal investment in areas such as data and analytics and information security.","We use cash in the quarter to continue returning value to our shareholders. We repurchase $684 million in common stock, and they have $2.8 billion remaining and our share repurchase authorization. We also pay $75 million in dividends in the quarter. And yesterday, the board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.02 to $0.41, an increase of 5%, which will be payable to shareholders in October.","In closing, we are pleased with a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we had growth across the majority of our businesses, which more than offset the weakness in the retail pharmacy market in the U.K. Our results for the first quarter, which include an unplanned one-time benefit of $0.10, have given us confidence in our full-year fiscal 20 outlook.","As a result, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance of $0.15 cents to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share, which represents solid growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint versus fiscal 2019. I would remind you that we do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling. We continue to expect a percentage of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first-half of the year as compared to the second-half to be similar to fiscal '19.","Overall, we're pleased with the focus. The execution of the performance across the company and we are off to a great start at fiscal 2020 and with that Brian and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much, and good afternoon. Congratulations on a nice start to the year. Brian, I know that it just came out, you know, this new safe [ph] importation action plan, but just being in Canada, how realistic is this that the manufacturers are going to allow product to go to Canada, then come back to the U.S., and just given the size of the Canadian market. And what role do you think that McKesson can play as the largest distributor in Canada to make sure that, one, product that meant for Canada stays in Canada? And two, anything that does potentially come to the States is safe?","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Lisa, for the question. We do think McKesson is in a uniquely informed position given our business in Canada and our presence here in the U.S., obviously. There were two tracks discussed in the plan that came out today. I will say I was encouraged by the fact that it was an invitation for industry and industry participants to bring their perspectives and knowledge into the discussion. And we will plan to be actively engaged in that. So our first and foremost responsibility and priority will be the safety and security of the supply chain, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Now, you rightly point out the Canadian market, from a population standpoint is less than a 10th of the U.S., and I suppose that various manufacturers will adopt various perspectives on what they may or may not do. We will carefully evaluate with various industry partners what the opportunity may be. But the overarching goal will be safety and security for citizens both north and south of a Canadian-U.S. border.","Lisa Gill","And then just as a follow-up, clearly what they're trying to solve first here is overall drug pricing. Can you talk about what we saw in the quarter around drug price inflation on the brand inside as well as the generic, clearly quarterly results coming better and better, especially on the drug distribution in the U.S. component of the business? So just wondering some of the key drivers there, as well as what you're seeing on both inflation and deflation in generics and branded?","Britt Vitalone","Thanks for that question, Lisa. I'll start, and Brian can add. As we talked about, in Brian's remarks on the branded side, what we saw from an inflation perspective was right along in line with our expectations. As you know, the first quarter is generally a softer quarter for branded inflation historically. And what we saw this quarter was really in line with our expectations. And as we think about the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance of mid single-digit inflation on the branded side.","On the generic side, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our sourcing operation, ClarusONE. What we've seen thus far in terms of our sourcing performance is right in line with our expectations. And on the sell side, as Brian mentioned, we continue to see a competitive market, but we continue to see a stable market. And so we're pleased with our ability to continue to source very competitively, which is certainly benefiting our customers, and we're certainly pleased with the ability to bring that to the sell side and our customers.","Lisa Gill","Great. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America.","Michael Cherny","Good evening. Thanks for all the comments so far. Britt, I want to dive in a little bit more into the U.S. pharma performance, maybe a microcosm for the rest of the business. It seems like just given the sheer magnitude of the performance and the outperformance on revenue, relative to at least your guidance, that a lot of it had to be driven by pharma. That being said, we didn't see a ton of gross margin pull-through. Now I might be splitting hairs a little bit here, but can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics in terms of what was the rationale for the slower gross profit growth relative to the revenue growth?","Britt Vitalone","Sure. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my comments, some of the revenue growth that we saw came from some of our largest national retail customers. And as you might expect, they don't generate as great a contribution to gross profit. We did see broad-based strong performance across the segment, not only with our largest national retail customers, but we saw good performance in our Health Systems segment, and we continue to see very strong performance in our Specialty business, and so we're quite pleased with that. Overall in the segment, while our gross profit was lower on a consolidated basis, within our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment we saw very good performance at the adjusted operating profit line. So, we're very pleased with the performance that we saw, very broad-based performance across that segment. And we think that we're well positioned to continue and achieve our guidance for the rest of the year.","Michael Cherny","And just on the contribution from Change. The way to think about the fact that the numbers didn't change despite the fact that you had a lower ownership stake versus guidance simply driven by the outperformance contribution for 1Q, or is there anything else that changed in terms of just the methodology, aside from just the pure less ownership stake?","Britt Vitalone","I would say that it's a combination of the lower ownership stake being offset by the deleveraging that changed it as a result of raising the funds for the IPO.","Michael Cherny","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. Thanks for taking my call. A question around the guidance, you beat by by $0.30. You only guide it up by $0.15. I know you mentioned the EU business is now expected to be at the lower end of the range. You also mentioned corporate expenses are going to be lower. Is there any other deltas there, is this conservatism. How should we think about the guidance relative to the beat in the quarter?","Britt Vitalone","Sure. So, I think there's a couple of things there, Kevin. First of all, we had good performance. We also called out a one-time gain from investment activities that is within our corporate expenses, that was about $0.10. So, while we had strong performance across really a broad base of our businesses, we did see weaker performance in our European business, and we did lower the range for the full-year as a result of that. We had the one-time unplanned benefit. We had some favorable timing in our corporate expense line. Again -- and we called out at the beginning of the year, we intend to continue making investments in our business both on a data and analytic side and in a technology side. So, we had strong broad-based performance across the business. We had a one-time gain within our corporate expense line. And I think it's early in the year, but we feel very confident, and confident enough to raise by $0.15.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the Medical segment, you give us the revenues ex MSD they would have been up 4%. What would the EBIT growth have been ex MSD in medical as we're not lapping it, just to give us a little bit of a better view of sort of what that business might look like going forward?","Britt Vitalone","Yes, we don't break that down specifically, Kevin, but what I would tell you is we had strong organic performance within that business. And as I mentioned, we had strong pharmaceutical sales performance as well as continued strong performance in our home delivery business. So we're pleased with the overall performance of the segment. We're pleased with the execution against the MSD acquisition. And as I mentioned, across the broad base of that business we had growth in pharmaceuticals, we had growth in our primary care business, as well as our home delivery business, so good organic growth as well as the MSD contribution.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good evening. So the first question here on the guidance. Obviously you had a very good performance on the top line. But when we look at your U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions guidance for the remainder of the year, it would suggest that revenues are going to normalize, where we're getting to around plus 4% to negative 1% on the revenue. And on the operating profit as well, kind of like a negative 2% to about 3.3% growth. So was there any kind of like pull forward of revenues this quarter that's going to normalize for the remainder of the year, or what kind of like drove that strength? I understand it is your largest customers, but if you can give us some more color behind that?","Britt Vitalone","Sure, thanks, Ricky. There's nothing unusual about the revenue development in the quarter, there's nothing that I would call out as a pull forward, to use your terminology. And we had very strong performance. It was primarily in our largest retail national accounts. But again, as I mentioned, we had a broad base of revenue growth across the business. One thing I would point out about our adjusted operating profit for the quarter, as I talked about in my opening remarks, last year we did have the opioid litigation cost that were included in that segment's results. And as I mentioned, we recorded $15 million last year for the New York State assessment. So I think you should factor that in. We're very pleased with the performance. We continue to expect to see growth in this segment for the remainder of the year. And we're very pleased with the revenue development.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. So let me ask a follow-up on specialty and think this is kind of like the third quarter both you and your peers are highlighting the strength in specialty is benefiting results. So can you just share with us little bit more color on specialty and whether you've seen any contractual changes in the last year that would explain the improvement in benefit because I'm assuming it's not coming from branded inflation. So how should we think about it benefit and how should we think about the sustainability of that benefit. And I think that historically you talked about specialty margin is being below traditional branded drugs. Is that still the case or should we assume that margins have re-rated higher?","Brian Tyler","I'll take this one and Britt can jump in if he'd like. So when you think about the Specialty as a segment and obviously the pipeline of innovation continues to be heavily slanted towards these types of products. In full legacy core U.S. pharma business, the margin profiles and structures you'd be accustomed to, I would characterize as still being in place and so while we do benefit from that specialty growth through good volumes and it is beneficial for us on the gross profit line, it does continue to be modestly dilutive to the rate. I would remind you though we also have a very good business in the community setting related to specialty products and that's both our U.S. oncology network and our unaffiliated community provider business. And those are the businesses where we continue to see really good momentum, really good growth and benefit from the pipeline of both innovative products and frankly biosimilars as they emerge and come to market.","And we have a very robust value proposition obviously a complete value proposition in the case of U.S. oncology. And then a wide assortment of tools and services we offer to the unaffiliated community providers and we think that that value proposition continues to earn us the right and the ability to grow and to benefit from the Specialty Pharmaceutical pipeline in general.","Operator","And next will be Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys. So I just wanted to go back to kind of the change in other math again because I don't think I have it straight. So in terms of the $108 million versus the prior year and then and that's for Change and then sort of the full-year guide I'm not sure I understand sort of what caused the up step and cadence and then sort of the notable downside. I know the ownership percentage is changing but it still seemed like a big delta and I'm guessing that's essentially what caused the spike in the other segment profits. I'm just trying to figure out sort of why that cadence was kind of funkier than what I think one would have expected?","Brian Tyler","Sure. Thanks for the question, Ross. So let me start with just the other side of the other segment just generally. With that segment we have our Canadian business we have our MRxTS businesses which are very strong businesses and growing very well for us. And we have our Change, our equity investment in Change. First I'd point out that our Canadian business continues to perform well, we certainly talked about the impact from the generic legislation at the beginning of the year. And that team really did a great job in mitigating that. And we're pleased with the performance of Canada, our MRxTS businesses continue to grow very well and we're making invest -- continue to make investments in those businesses.","Within our Change asset, we did have the ownership Change from 70% to 58.5% effective in our second quarter. And in that second quarter, you'll also see the impact from the delevering. Within the first quarter though, there are a couple of things that I would point out. First of all Change had as most companies had the implementation of the revenue recognition standard and that created a timing element for the year.","For the full-year that's not going to have an impact on McKesson but it does have an impact earlier, favorable impact earlier than year and then a reverse out as the year goes on. And then of course as you think about that business, there's a mix of income between taxable, non-taxable depending on the legal entity. So what I would say is primarily for the first quarter, you see some timing impact from the revenue recognition standard and you see a mix of income between the entities of taxable and non-taxable.","Ross Muken","Got it. And then maybe just thinking about sort of, maybe business development activity or the M&A side of things, a lot of things and services, including your own asset, obviously have challenging multiples. And there's a lot of political wins going on, I guess, how do you sort of frame what's the right time to be more active again, on sort of tuck-in M&A and how the risk reward sort of, is there versus just continuing to buy your own equity, which given is cash flow yield seems like a reasonable investment.","Brian Tyler","Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. And I think we would characterize our M&A activity in recent quarters of being relatively light, that doesn't mean that we're out of that space. And then, I think when we think about capital allocation, and we're always very focused on where are the opportunities to deploy capital to build platforms and businesses and services for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are being very diligent to make sure that as we look at this process that is guided by our strategy, that's guided by our focal areas, it's guided by the markets and segments where we think we have good businesses, strong teams, the right to win.","And anywhere in those segments, we can find assets that are complimentary and accelerate and an accelerant to our business. We're quite interested in those. We obviously consider alternative use of the capital and return of the capital in making those calculations and final determinations of what's the best way to deploy that capital on behalf of our shareholders. So we continue to be active, we continue to be in deal flow. We continue to look carefully at the landscape with an eye to make sure it's aligned strategically that it's an investment and accelerant. And that it is the smartest way to deploy capital across the various uses of capital we have.","Ross Muken","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And moving on to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Baxter","Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the sell side environment. You said in the past that in general your contracts last about three years. So it appears to be coming up against some of the independent pharmacy contracts that renewed during 2016. Can you give us, and hopefully give us a sense of what proportion of those contracts have been addressed at this point? And also any color you can write on with the discussions look like in terms of helping your pharmacy partners deal with the pressure they are under would be very helpful, thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, so typically, as we've talked about, we would renew roughly a third of our contracts in any one given year. We recently got through two big retail national account renewals successfully, which was great news and I'd say, I'd characterize this year is having a fairly normal portfolio of renewals and renewal activities.","So I wouldn't point to anything particularly unusual in that regard. You know, we work with our partners over the life of these contracts. We are typically engaging in, day-to-day and discussions; we begin conversations well in advance of any sort of sudden renewal activity. So we really view it as kind of an ongoing dialogue and an ongoing partnership over the course of these contracts. And you'll be well familiar with our track record of renewing these particularly larger deals as it relates to independence in general and what are we doing to help independence?","I would say independence is probably long been at the core of McKesson as a company. It's a key part of our commitment that community practices we think being central to addressing the access cost and quality issues this country faces the independence -- continue to benefit from the programs and services that we invest in. They can hence, they can choose to consume that and a sort of all-encompassing way through a relationship with Health Mart and our access reimbursement services that come along with that. But we are constantly looking at how we innovate for them both and how they interact with their patients, how they attract patients and draw footfall to their stores, how they monetize that footfall, both in front and behind the counter, and we work with them, day-in and day-out and then just the efficiency of the operation of their business.","Community pharmacy today feels reimbursement pressure, it's felt that pressure every year, I've been in the business and that's almost 23 years now. So we partner with them very closely to help them ensure their position to survive and adapt and innovate and independent community pharmacies do tend to be creative individual business folks who find ways to unmet needs in the communities they serve.","Stephen Baxter","Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. And then just one quickly on capital deployment and the pacing of share repurchase, so it looks like if you carry this magnitude of share repurchase through the balance of the year, you'd end up with something a few million shares below where your guidance is which looks like 185 million shares unchanged versus previous, so I was wondering if you could help us understand the progression of share repurchase and how you guys approach the balance between opportunism and planned activity throughout the year. Thanks.","Brian Tyler","Yes, thanks for the question. I would just reaffirm that we've not changed our assumption on our diluted shares for the end of the year. We don't have a set amount that you should think about for modeling to take it from quarter-to-quarter. We think about capital deployment and as Brian mentioned, we think about it opportunities on strategy and where we have opportunities to invest on strategy or invest internally, we do that. And certainly, we've had an opportunity this quarter to return more to our shareholders. So we make those decisions on a regular basis, but in terms of our guide on shares for the end of the year, we've not changed that.","Operator","And our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nippon Research.","Eric Percher","Thank you. I'd like to go back to the gross margin question and maybe given the comments around independents I know that was one segment that hasn't been driving the same contribution that some of the other areas, the retail nationals and other less profitable accounts maybe as you think about the growth in revenue and what that translates into had a press profit growth level at a period of time where independents aren't driving it and a period of time where generic contributions aren't as high what do you see as the and natural growth rate?","Brian Tyler","Well, Eric, what I would point to is if you look at our consolidated gross margin, there is multiple factors to consider in here and one of the things that impacted our gross margin in the quarter was the weak retail results in our U.K. business within Europe. And clearly, we had a large proportion of revenue being driven by our largest retail national account. We have, we had a very broad base of revenue growth across our business and overall I would just say that one of the things that impacted to the negative side was not only the mix of revenue, but the impact from a weak retail environment in the U.K. We think about our independent customers within U.S. Pharma. We haven't seen anything different this quarter from the previous couple of quarters. It was -- I don't know that there's anything really to call out specific about that.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, when we look at the kind of reimbursement environment that retail independents are facing, I think we talked last quarter about the fact that we look at our data, we really see an aggregate a very normal headwind there has been established something that's kind of been consistent with prior years. And on average, that is true statement within that average there are based on patient mix and contracts that the government private commercial product mix and the really the patient population in your in catchment area, you can see some winners and some losers. But on a blended way is really feels like a steady the same steady reimbursement headwind we've been accustomed to.","Eric Percher","So I think we see that and certainly the headwind in international gross margin is evident, but my question is really where we don't see at a distribution and specialty segment level, what are your thoughts on the ability to drive gross profit growth relative to revenue growth and that's really the question was getting at?","Brian Tyler","Well, as we've talked about previously, Eric the growth of specialty products is going to have a dilutive impact on the rate. It's certainly very good for us from a margin dollars perspective as I think about that the U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, again, it's a business that is broad-based from a distribution perspective, both in the nature of the products in the customers, but also the specialty businesses that Brian talked about our U.S. oncology asset, our provider base that we have and also the manufacturing life capabilities that the services that we provide to the manufacture those also add to our gross margin profile.","So, and I think about our distribution business is very scale certainly is impacted by the product mix, but the fact that it's broad-based in terms of our U.S. Oncology asset or other specialty assets and then our manufacturing services assets, I think that really does give us the opportunity to develop that gross profit over time.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations. Britt just want to follow-up on Ricky's question from earlier clarify that question again. So you put up an 8% growth number in the U.S. for Q1 and yet you're maintaining the guidance calling low to mid single digits. So is there anything we should be thinking about that could drive a deceleration in growth. I mean you've talked about specialty being strong or is there anything to call out there?","Britt Vitalone","Yes, I would the thing that I would point out is I think we saw a larger proportion of revenue from our largest retail national accounts in the quarter. We still expect to see very strong revenue growth in the mid single digit range for the year. I think as you just think about the quarterization of that, we saw it a larger proportion of that coming from our largest accounts and that had obviously a very favorable impact in the quarter.","Brian Tanquilut","Got it. All right, thanks guys.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess similar one Britt on the corporate expense side. You're pointing towards the lower end but just looking at where you ended up in the quarter, it still seems like quite a big ramp through the year to get there. Anything you know of or that you anticipate on the corporate expense side that it would be terribly different than what we saw in the quarter. And then I guess Brian just I'll throw my follow-up out there. I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks but large proposed generic merger out there. Curious if or how impactful that would be on not only ClarusONE but on McKesson in general if you had a view that would be great. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Brian as we think of our corporate expenses at the beginning of the year, we talked about the things that are driving the higher corporate expense year-over-year. We talked about the increase in opioid litigation costs. We talked about the increased investments that we were making in technology particularly infrastructure and data and analytics. We still intend to make those investments throughout the year. We had a favorable timing related impact in the first quarter but our intention is to continue to invest in those capabilities as we go throughout the rest of the year.","We also in my remarks, I talked about our opioid litigation cost projection for the full-year still remaining at $150 million. And then the thing that I did talk about that is included on our corporate expenses was the onetime benefit we had from investing activities which reduced our corporate expenses in the quarter and that allowed us to take our guide corporate expenses down to the low end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year.","Brian Tyler","Robert to your second question, we actually did not comment on this, I think in our opening remarks. So thank you for the question on the Pfizer-Mylan merger. So I would start by saying that these we have strong relationships with both of these organizations and they've been important partners for us. And if McKesson and in ClarusONE the rationale for the merger as I understand it is broadening of the portfolio, there is some cost synergy, some efficiency and frankly at the scale that we operate and by being partners with large scale healthy organizations that are capable of continuity of supply and competitive pricing is it can be a good thing. So we'll evaluate how this merger comes together. We'll continue to be a dialog with them but it wouldn't say it poses any imminent concerns from our perspective.","Operator","And our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, hey thanks for taking questions. I think you touched on biosimilars being a benefit particularly in the oncology network. Can you talk about sort of your outlook here? I think there's some talks about I think insulin moving over to jurisdiction by the -- I guess with the biologics group and FDA, CIBR and that that could pave the way for interchangeability on at least with biosimilars insulin. Maybe your thoughts on where you're seeing sort of that regulatory landscape right now and how you think about that opportunity and what it means further down the road for you?","Brian Tyler","Well, I mean the biosimilar landscape in general, we feel pretty positive about more choices more substitute ability or interchangeability that gives clinician, the more choices hopefully gives it helps addressed cost challenges we see in the marketplace and we think with the footprint of providers that we have in the community, we're particularly well positioned to take advantage of those trends. So, we also continue to work with innovators, first and foremost, as we think about these if the patient outcome is a clinical-oriented decision is what product is best in the formulary to meet the clinical needs to the extent, there are a variety of choices and interchangeability that tends to be good for a company like us with the markets and channels that we serve that choice tends to be a positive thing for us.","Charles Rhyee","Is that something that you think is coming close in that you're trying to plan ahead of that or is that you feel there is still a ways off?","Brian Tyler","It's really hard to comment on what the regulatory pathways will be and timing and our recent experience in policy arena tells us anything, it's very difficult to forecast. What may come out, lots of discussion what they come out ultimately and what it may look like in its final form it would be, it would probably not be in my best judgment to try to predict that for you.","Charles Rhyee","Okay, fair enough. And just one last question, you talked about the FX impact being sort of net neutral but if I look, it seems like, particularly the pound and the euro have been getting weaker relative to the dollar, how are you guys thinking about that or sort of what your expectations around that. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, I don't want to predict the direction of the pound. On a consolidated basis, it doesn't have a material impact. But as I called out, it did have an impact on revenues within the Europe segment for the quarter. So, obviously we'll watch that very carefully but as we think about it on a consolidated basis, we don't see an impact.","Charles Rhyee","Great, thank you.","Holly Weiss","Operator, you have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly that question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric Coldwell","Hi, thanks very much and good evening. Most of my main ones recovered but I'll shift gears a bit, I would like your thoughts on generic introductions for the rest of the year if possible, expected to be a good guy or a bad guy to profitability on a year-over-year basis and then specifically if I dare ask Lyrica comes out with roughly 10 manufacturer is a very low initial price. How did that impact pretty big product, how does that impact your thinking on generic profitability in trends in that market seen so many manufacturers launch it such a deep discount to the brand.","Brian Tyler","Yes, thanks for that question. Generic launches as we've talked about do not have the size of impact that they used to have -- they have a modest impact on our profitability. So we don't see that having any change from our previous views on that. In terms of Lyrica, we are very fortunate to have a strong sourcing organization like first one where we can partner with multiple manufacturers. We don't see that Lyrica is going to change the direction of our generics profitability will certainly be a benefit for us and it will certainly be a benefit from our customers, but it will have a modest impact at most.","Eric Coldwell","Great.","Brian Tyler","Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thank you, Justin for facilitating this call. I want to thank everyone on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a strong start for our fiscal 2020 and I'm really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I do want to take a minute to recognize the outstanding performance of really all of the McKesson employees and team members and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities, make better health possible. So thank you team McKesson. Have a good evening everyone.","Operator","Well, thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

This morning, McKesson announced our agreement to acquire PSS World Medical for a total consideration of approximately $2.1 billion. The close of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including all necessary regulatory clearances and the approval of the PSS shareholders.","McKesson's Medical-Surgical business and PSS will combine to form a leading provider of medical supplies and services and technology. We're very excited about this transaction and the value it will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and to our shareholders.","Before I walk through our thoughts on the strategy of the combined organization, let me review the primary financial impacts of the transaction, and Jeff will also provide more information in his remarks.","Under the terms of the agreement, McKesson is acquiring all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical for $29 in cash. In total, including PSS World Medical's existing debt of about $480 million and related transaction costs, the transaction is valued at approximately $2.1 billion.","The value and synergy in this transaction will happen over time. By the fourth year, we expect to realize annual pretax synergies in excess of $100 million. This transaction underscores McKesson's deep commitment to its physician and extended care customers. Industry participants will play an increasingly important role as the implementation of health care reform continues and demographic shifts increased demand.","By preserving the strengths of both businesses, the combined organization will bring extensive distribution capabilities, deep product and technology expertise and a broad portfolio of business services to the industry.","The combined organization will benefit from the addition of PSS World Medical's distribution network, private fleet, broad laboratory customer base and strong private-label offerings, which will complement McKesson's broad portfolio of solutions to maximize value for our customers.","Upon the close of the transaction, the 2 management teams have come together under the combined leadership of Stanton McComb, President of McKesson Medical-Surgical business; and Gary Corless, President and Chief Executive Officer of PSS. The combined business will report to Paul Julian, Executive Vice President and Group President of McKesson. Stanton and Gary are both exceptional leaders who are passionate about their teams and the opportunity to enhance the value we deliver to our customers.","In summary, we have a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and we are very excited about the opportunity to bring together these 2 great organizations.","Turning now to McKesson's results for the second quarter. Today we reported another solid quarter with total company revenues of $29.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92. Based on our performance year-to-date, we are updating our previous outlook for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.15 to $7.35 for fiscal 2013.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both of our segments of our business.","Distribution Solutions had strong operating profit growth on revenue that was down 1% compared to the prior year. As you know, our fiscal 2013 is a robust year for oral generic launches, and in particular, our second quarter saw a number of sizable launches which had a deflationary impact on our revenue line.","As a result, adjusted operating profit grew by 10%, driven by strong execution across the segment.","So overall, I'm pleased with the financial performance of the Distribution Solutions segment in the first half of the fiscal year, and I remain confident in our full year expectations.","Turning now to our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. I want to highlight a couple of important accomplishments. First, I know there's been a fair amount of discussion about the overall competitive environment, perhaps driven by a few very public contract awards in our industry in the current year.","We are proud to have long-standing customer relationships, and that the core of McKesson's values as a company is to deliver outstanding service, products, technology and innovation so that we have the opportunity to create customers for life.","As a matter of what we consider to be good business practice, we don't make a habit of talking about our customers or our competitors' customers publicly. We believe our customers value the confidential nature of our business relationship. One of the few relationships that is more public than others due to our customers' disclosure requirements, is our relationship with Rite Aid. McKesson has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Rite Aid, and we're very pleased to have recently extended our distribution agreement through March of 2016.","Turning to another important part of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. For the third time in 4 years, McKesson's Health Mart franchise achieved the highest ranking in overall customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in the J.D. Power and Associates 2012 U.S. National Pharmacy Study. The study encompassed responses from more than 12,700 consumers surveyed on overall customer satisfaction. Our Health Mart pharmacists delivered outstanding personalized care to their patients every day, and we're proud that their dedication has been acknowledged.","This recognition from consumers further reinforces the value patients receive from Health Mart pharmacies and also demonstrates the value of the partnership between Health Mart and community pharmacies. We're also extremely pleased to reach the milestone of 3,000 Health Mart stores during our second quarter.","And finally, in the second quarter, we named Mark Walchirk as the new President of our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. Mark has held numerous roles inside of McKesson over the past 11 years, including Chief Operating Officer of McKesson Specialty Health and Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business.","Mark succeeds Brian Tyler, who is appointed Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development in August, following Marc Owens' appointment as President of McKesson Specialty Health. These executive appointments demonstrate the deep bench strength of leadership talent within McKesson, and I believe we have the best business leaders in the industry.","In the specialty market, we continue to strengthen our position. I've been pleased to see our teams' ability to win new customers and expand our value to existing customers in this market through a combination of great service and great technology. We also continued to add physicians to our US Oncology network and grow and expand our innovative partnerships with hospitals throughout the country.","In our Canadian Distribution business, we delivered solid operating performance across our many lines of business in the second quarter, and I'm pleased to see the steady progress our team continues to make in Canada. And the acquisition of the Katz's banner business is performing extremely well. We've not only succeeded in working closely with the acquired banner members to strengthen their business but we've also seen benefits across our existing banner network from the expanded scale we acquired with the Katz acquisition.","Through acquisitions like the Katz Group, as well as the solid execution and innovation of our team in Canada, we continue to find ways to mitigate the impact of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business, we continue to benefit from organic growth as well as our ability to gain new customers.","Revenues were flat for the quarter, but this was mainly due to there being 5 fewer days of sales in the quarter. Adjusting for the difference in sales days, revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter.","We've had terrific momentum and strong results in our Medical-Surgical business for some time. With the acquisition of PSS World Medical, we will leverage the best of both organizations including the unified strength of the most knowledgeable and tenured sales teams in the industry.","The combination of great products, services, technology and people will be the platform to continue this momentum and enhance the value we will bring to our customers.","In summary, I'm pleased with the solid performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Our first half results have been modestly better than we had planned, primarily due to timing. But our full year expectations remain unchanged.","For the second quarter, revenues were flat and adjusted operating margins were 13.83%. We continue to make progress in ensuring our customers' success and supporting them on their journey to reaching important Meaningful Use milestones as they move forward with creating more connected and accountable health care communities.","We start with a portfolio that is unmatched in breadth, which gives McKesson a unique view in the flow of information between patients, providers, hospitals and pharmacies as it takes place today and what will be necessary for the future. As our customers' needs evolve, we will invest internally and externally in the critical technologies that will help them succeed.","In the second quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions, and although they are not expected to have material impact on earnings in the near-term, they are important to our strategy going forward. At the end of September, we announced our acquisition of MedVentive which will become part of our provider technology business. MedVentive's products and solutions will work together to enable providers to proactively manage the clinical health of at-risk patient populations by identifying gaps in care and delivering actionable information to care providers. These capabilities are important to the accountable care and patient-centered medical home offerings across our Technology Solutions segment.","In early October, we announced our plans to acquire Med3000 which further strengthens our core offering in revenue management solutions. Just to remind people, who might not be as familiar with our revenue management solutions business, this business offers leading outsourced financial and billing solutions primarily to physician practices and hospitals. These solutions are more important than ever as physicians, hospitals and other entities work to reduce costs and run their businesses more effectively.","Turning to McKesson Health Solutions. We've been investing and creating more connected solutions for our customers, and one recent example is McKesson Reimbursement Manager. This solution has the ability to manage multiple reimbursement models by identifying the correct provider reimbursement rate based on the unique combination of several provider- and client-specific attributes.","This capability is important to payers and providers as they navigate the complex reimbursement models that are becoming more common in the marketplace.","And finally, turning to RelayHealth, which is a key length in bringing together many of our solutions for our customers, you've heard us talk about the pharmacy and hospital network business and we have -- also have been growing the business in the management of clinical information. Our ability to connect health care information in a secure way helped us position for win the recent TRICARE award for secure messaging throughout the entire military health system, and for the Air Force award for automatically populating patient health records with actionable information from the Air Force's data repository.","In summary, we report another solid quarter of operating performance, and I'm pleased to use the tremendous strength of our balance sheet to bring together 2 great organizations, our Medical-Surgical business and PSS World Medical. And we still have the financial flexibility to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders.","I'm proud of our accomplishments and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect a solid performance at this halfway point in our fiscal year.","We're obviously pleased that the strength of our balance sheet has allowed us this morning to announce our transaction with PSS. And I'll offer a few financial comments on PSS at the end of my remarks.","My comments today on our earnings will focus on our $1.92 adjusted earnings per share, which as you recall, excludes 3 types of items, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments and certain litigation reserve adjustments.","The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release.","Let me first turn to our consolidated results for the quarter which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion for the quarter, down 1% from the prior year. There are a number of factors behind this 1% decline, and I'll cover these as I discuss each of the segments in more detail.","On this small decline in revenues, our adjusted gross profit was up 4% for the quarter. I'd remind you that this quarter reflects a record number of recent generic launches which had a deflationary impact on revenues while driving up our adjusted gross profit.","Total adjusted operating expenses were up just 2% to $1 billion for the quarter as we showed good expense management across the company.","Moving down the P&L. Other income was up $4 million for the quarter to $10 million and interest expense declined 14% to $55 million for the quarter. As you recall, we repaid $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012, and we now have another $500 million maturity due in March of fiscal 2013.","Looking ahead, we expect to refinance both amounts later this fiscal year. As a result, we would expect our interest expense to increase modestly in the back half of fiscal 2013. I would point out that this is just a refinancing of existing debt and is independent of the PSS transaction, the financing for which I will come back to at the end of my remarks.","Turning now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 30% benefited from $7 million of net favorable discrete tax items. Similar to the first quarter, some of these favorable tax discrete items came in earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. Also, for the full year, we now expect a higher total of net favorable discrete tax items.","As a result of these changes, we've lowered our full year estimate of the adjusted tax rate a bit from 31% to 30.5%.","Adjusted net income for the quarter was $461 million, up 13% from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.92, an increase of 18%, compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.63.","And wrapping up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 4% year-over-year to 240 million. We continue to expect our full year average diluted shares to come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares outstanding.","Before moving on to our segment results, let me comment on one other item, which while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically the $44 million AWP litigation charge.","As a reminder, last quarter, we reached a final agreement with the coalition of State Attorneys General to resolve the majority of state medicaid claims related to AWP. Since then, we have continued to work through the remaining state Medicaid cases. As a result of progress made towards resolving these remaining state Medicaid cases, we have increased the AWP litigation reserve by $44 million.","This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.11 per diluted share.","Let's now move on to our segment adjusted earnings results which can be found on Schedule 3A. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues were down 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. Direct distribution and services revenues were also down 1% for the quarter to $20.9 billion. This is roughly in line with our original expectations as we continue to expect direct revenues to be fairly flat for the full fiscal year due to the record number of generic launches in fiscal 2013.","Our warehouse revenues decreased 2% year-over-year. The primary driver of this decline was brand-to-generic conversions which particularly impact our warehouse revenues. Relative to our original expectation of unusually strong growth in our warehouse revenues this year, we now expect warehouse revenues to be fairly flat for the full year. As you know, we earn lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. Therefore, the impact on earnings from lower warehouse revenue is quite modest.","Canadian revenues, on a reported basis, declined 5% for the quarter primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact and there being 1 less sales day in the quarter. Factoring out both of these items, Canadian revenues declined just 1% for the quarter. And as John mentioned earlier, our team in Canada continues to do a good job of mitigating the impact of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs.","Moving on to Medical-Surgical. While reported revenues were flat for the quarter at $873 million, results were impacted by there being 5 fewer sales days in the quarter this year. Excluding the impact of having 5 fewer sales days, Medical-Surgical revenues grew a healthy 8% for the quarter driven by market growth and new customers.","We are pleased to see continued steady growth in our Medical-Surgical business and believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum forward.","Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 6% for the quarter to $1.3 billion. This represents an adjusted gross margin improvement of 34 basis points versus the prior year. There were a number of components driving these results. We did, of course, have tremendous growth in oral generic profits this quarter. The quarter also benefited from 2 timing items that particularly aided our results. First, we received $19 million of favorable antitrust settlements in the quarter which added roughly $0.05 to $0.06 to our adjusted earnings this quarter. We do plan, over the course of the year, for some level of these types of settlements, but the timing and precise amount always varies.","Second, we also saw a timing shift this quarter with our manufacturer economics. When you think about our relationships with manufacturers, the majority of our compensation is fixed over the course of a full year. However, the timing of when we recognize that compensation can be impacted by price increases and other factors, some of which were particularly strong this quarter.","Adjusted operating expense in the segment was up just 3% for the quarter primarily driven by the costs associated with acquiring the Katz assets. Given this, we were pleased overall with the expense management in this segment.","The adjusted operating margin rate for this segment was 241 basis points this quarter, an increase of 25 basis points versus the prior year. As you've heard me say many times before, given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. Based on our first half fiscal 2013 results, we now expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points compared to our full year fiscal 2012 adjusted operating margin rate of 210 basis points.","In summary, we're pleased with the first half performance in our Distribution Solutions segment.","Moving now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were flat for the quarter at $824 million and adjusted gross profit declined 3% to $384 million.","Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending was $116 million, roughly flat with last year's $115 million. The capitalization rate was unchanged at 9%.","Adjusted operating expense increased by just 1% in the quarter to $272 million, and we are pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth.","Technology Solutions' adjusted operating profit was down 10% versus 1 year ago to $114 million and our adjusted operating margin was 13.83% compared to 15.27% 1 year ago. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens or 14% to 16%.","Leaving our segment performance now and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $9.8 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.5 billion and our day sales outstanding increased by 1 day to 26 days. Compared to 1 year ago, inventories increased 7% to $10.1 billion and payables were up 4% to $15.5 billion.","This resulted in our day sales in inventory increasing by 2 days to 32 days, and our day sales and payables increasing by 3 days to 50 days. These working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $459 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operations will be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion. And of this amount, approximately $1.6 billion was offshore. Overall, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 31.7% for the quarter, at the low end of our target range of 30% to 40%.","Capitalized spending was $167 million for the first 6 months of the year, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $425 million and $475 million.","Now I will turn to our outlook. Given the solid first half results, we are updating our guidance on adjusted earnings from $7.05 to $7.35 to a new range of $7.15 to $7.35. In addition, we now expect $0.54 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. And due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.15 for litigation reserve adjustments.","Also to remind you, as a result of the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain we had in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.18.","Now let me take a few moments to talk about the financial aspects of the PSS transaction that we announced today. As in all our acquisitions, this acquisition had to make both great strategic sense and great financial sense.","As you've heard me say before, we look at many financial metrics when evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe PSS will provide a great return on capital for our shareholders, create value we can only get by combining the 2 companies and reasonably share that value creation between the 2 companies' shareholders.","For now, we have chosen to not include any impact from this transaction in our fiscal 2013 guidance, which I just took you through, since we cannot predict the precise timings of the close.","To help you think about the P&L impact, however, if you were to simply assume that the transaction was 100% debt-financed at a 4% interest rates, we would expect the acquisition to be $0.15 to $0.25 accretive in the first 12 months after closing on an adjusted earnings basis.","For those of you who track us on a GAAP basis, our initial estimate for intangible amortization is roughly $100 million per year. Longer term, as John stated earlier, our synergies in this business case of over $100 million per year will be realized incrementally over the first 4 years as we integrate the companies.","To be clear, our intention on permanent financing will be to use a mixture of cash on hand and new debt. Initially, we will be putting in place a bridge facility to help fund the close of the transaction. The precise amount of new permanent debt, we then issue after the transaction closes, will vary depending upon circumstances at that time.","To make another probably obvious point, probably the transaction of this size, given our portfolio approach to capital deployment, we are likely to do a little less share repurchases than we otherwise would've done in the near-term.","And finally, once the transaction is closed, we will be reporting the results of PSS as part of our Distribution Solutions segment.","Thanks and with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So basically my question is -- my understanding is the companies have slightly different distribution models when you look at McKesson versus PSSI, where one is kind of using a third-party carrier. The other one's using may be a fleet of vans for a lot of the physical delivery. So I'm just trying to get a sense whether you thought about the go-forward strategy and the physical distribution. Is that also a major part of the cost synergies of the deal? Just looking for more color on that.","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, I think both companies have a great track record of customers with strong relationships and long-term relationships with our organization. And those relationships are built by a combination of the quality of the people that we use in the field, both the delivery people, the distribution workers that pick the product to make sure the order's delivered on time. And clearly, the sales force that has a relationship. So we're going to be very careful and very thoughtful about any changes we make that might disrupt those customer relationships. And frankly, there's things we can learn from both of our approaches relative to distribution and transportation that we need to take the sort of the best of the best approach in the marketplace. So I think I don't want to get too specific, but I think we believe they're significant value from the combination. And we should make sure that we're very careful about preserving what we're doing. Our synergy number that we provided, we think, is appropriate and will not cause significant disruption that will be noticed by our customers as a result of taking out the cost.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our question again from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. Just the first one was on the process, if you can give us any background on the deal itself, how it came together? And anything in that realm, that\u2019d be helpful.","John H. Hammergren","Well, obviously, we have had a long-term industry relationship with PSS World Medical. And as I mentioned on with Steven, I think that our organizations know each other well. We've competed well in the field, and I think that we have had mutual admiration for the cultures built by both companies. And so I think as you would expect, off and on over the years, we probably have had lots of conversations about opportunities. And all I would say is that the door was made available to us when the discussion opened up around their extended care business. And through those discussions, we were able to expand the discussion to talk about the larger transaction. We know these businesses well. We have a strong footprint in the primary care and physician business as well as in extended care. And I think that relationship over decades really in the marketplace has afforded us the opportunity.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, you did mention a couple of the IT deals that you had done. Med3000, I thought, was a decent size. Could you guys offer any color on the financial impact there both in terms of balance sheet as well as income statement?","John H. Hammergren","Let me talk a little bit about the strategy and then Jeff, perhaps, can talk about the financials of the transaction. You're right, Med3000 is slightly larger than the MedVentive deal. The Med3000 deal fits nicely with the assets that had been previously acquired by Per-Se, and then acquired by McKesson when we acquired Per-Se. We believe we are the market leader in revenue cycle management and services, like billing and collections, with physician offices in this country, and we've got a very good model to make that happen. And we are pleased to bring the Med3000 team into the fold. Frankly, their model is a little more expansive, not as scaled as ours. But it goes into other areas of the marketplace where we are looking to build our capabilities, and so we're excited to bring that team on. And it's got a great leadership and management team, and I think it'll move us strategically. The MedVentive deal, as you mentioned, is more of a technology asset. And that fills a need -- bringing together several of the McKesson existing assets as our customers struggle with the complexity associated with trying to manage patient populations and be at risk for those populations. And so I think that, that also positions us well. A frankly smaller scale and -- but that company has been around almost a decade, perhaps slightly longer. So they've been working on this process of taking a longitudinal view of a patient and their care for a long time. So they both fit nicely for us. And Jeff, maybe you could talk a little bit about the financing?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, from a financial perspective, Tom, in the near-term, both deals have an immaterial impact on the income statement. And from a cash and purchase price perspective, they're small enough. So we won't be breaking out the specific purchase price which just tells you that the cash involved is not material relative to the $2 billion to $2.5 billion of operating cash flow we'll have this year. Certainly, as they close, you'll see in our cash flow statement next quarter our total spending on all the acquisitions that closed in the quarter.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a couple -- I just had a couple of questions. John, maybe bigger picture, we've been talking in the last few quarters about hospitals buying physician practices and how that market is changing and hearing about what margins will look like going forward. Can you talk to us about what you see going forward under ACA, should it stay? And physicians buying -- I'm sorry -- hospitals buying physician practices, and what this means to now be the leader in that marketplace?","John H. Hammergren","Sure, Lisa. Clearly, we have to continue to evolve our model as our customers aggregate together perhaps in larger practices, or as you said, some of them have chosen to sell their practices to hospitals or to IDNs. What's great about McKesson is we have a very, I think, a strong relationship and an understanding for the acute side of the business. As you may recall, we had an acute Med-Surg business at one point, which we sold. But our knowledge of that marketplace, in how hospitals operate and hospital GPOs operate, I think, has benefited us as we've evolved our model to provide service and solutions to customers who either are existing customers who are being acquired and want to remain with McKesson or -- and frankly, new customers that have been acquired by hospitals, where hospitals are struggling with a more unified approach to their supply chain requirements. Clearly, the acute care distributors stand in a position to compete with us for that business, but because they have a position in the hospital space. But we also think there's an opportunity for us to continue to service these customers, and we have had very little customer attrition through an acquisition by a health system or a hospital. And I think the priority for those health systems, frankly, is not the 1% or 2% of the supply chain cost that those physicians may represent of their entire medical-surgical spend, I think they're more focused on the productivity and efficiency and alignment those physicians might have with the enterprise, particularly if they're trying to build a at-risk ACO or PCMH kind of a model. And so I think that to the extent that they can put the logistics and supply chain requirements behind them and not have to disrupt that productivity by making significant changes in distribution, they benefit. So we have successfully navigated with our customers these changes in their ownership models, and I think we're well positioned to handle the scale requirements that are necessary for hospital customers. Having said that, clearly, we have competitors on the acute care side that have an avenue into this marketplace, and we have to be vigilant on our value proposition.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, John, for you or Jeff. How do we think about the synergies that you talked about, the $100 million, is that just cost? Or do you think that there's some level of revenue synergies, especially from an IT perspective? My understanding is that today, Athena has a relationship with PSS. So do you see that as a future revenue relationship opportunity?","John H. Hammergren","Well, just to answer the question directly, our synergy model is really all cost base, and we believe we have a line of sight to those synergies. It'll take us some time, as Jeff and I have mentioned, this is not an easy process and we want to make sure that we're not disrupting our customer relationships. But we -- to the extent that there's upside in this from a revenue and a value proposition perspective, we'll continue to build that out, and that's not included in the numbers that we provided this morning. As it relates to relationships that PSS World Medical may have with others in the industry, whether they're on a laboratory side, frankly, in terms of their sourcing and their power in that space or whether it's on the technology side, as you noted, there may be opportunities for us to leverage what they're doing through our sales force, and we look forward to that. And if they have relationships with companies that McKesson has been unable to build, we look forward to extending those relationships across our footprint. And at the end, even to the extent that we might have some competition with McKesson's internal capabilities across the footprint, we're not going to -- out of the gate discourage any or dismantle any of the relationships that PSS World Medical has built without careful evaluation. Athenahealth has built a great model, I know the team there. And their model, frankly, is a little different than the model we have in our REMS business. We have a different physician practice target that we're looking at compared to what they're doing, and so I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I know I'm only supposed to be asking 2 but I just want a clarification here. Does the transaction include the Elder Care Business because I know you're in the long-term care business as well?","John H. Hammergren","Yes. The transaction is for PSS World Medical, as it stands today. The transaction that had been spoken about by the PSS World Medical management relative to their extended care platform is where we began. But that is no longer going to be sold as a separate asset.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to follow up -- I think, it was Tom's question, and you addressed most of it. But you did mention during the call that you expect your Technology Solutions outlook to be the same as before. And previously, you'd stated Technology Solutions growth similar to last year's rate of about 4%. Since then, you've acquired 2 businesses, which on a full year basis, would add about 5 points to growth by my math. So I'm curious if you've just not included the acquisition revenue performance? Or if you're implicitly showing us that Technology Solutions' underlying organic growth is perhaps a little less than you originally expected?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, the key here clearly is the acquisitions are closing late in the year and have no actually material impact on our revenues this year. So our view of the underlying performance of the organic MTS businesses hasn't changed at all.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jeff, I'm sorry if I missed this one, when do you expect the acquisitions to close?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, they're closing in the third -- late in the second quarter and sometime during the third quarter.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So about a 0.5 year influence? Okay, that's good.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the sales force question and then on the synergies. Obviously, this is largely sales force-driven market. So I was hoping if you could share some thoughts on maybe the different approach from the 2 companies as it relates to that. And then maybe how you're thinking about the overall sales footprint once McKesson Medical and PSS are combined.","John H. Hammergren","Well, we have a great admiration for the sales force that has been built over time at PSS World Medical. And we believe strongly that sales force is one of the points of significant value in this transaction, as is the Medical-Surgical sales force at McKesson. And so we hope that we will be able to retain all of the sales reps on both sides. Our synergy case has no reduction in sales force modeled into it, and we don't plan to reduce the size of our sales footprint at all. Now we'll have to do some reconciliation in the marketplace relative to territories so that -- we have some overlaps in certain markets and what we're going to do there. But all in all, I would hope that the sales forces in both companies look at this as a significant opportunity because we expand what's in their bag. And the culture and economic models for the reps are very similar, I don't think that there'll be a compensation surprise for the sales force. And as I said, we're focused on retaining them. The other part of that is the service model behind it. The distribution networks and the ability to deliver -- the ability to make sure that the product is available. All of those infrastructure capabilities may change slightly. But our goal is to make sure that we don't disrupt the expectation from a service perspective that our customers have become dependent on. So I think that this should be seen as real positive by the sales forces.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Jeff, if I could just ask one on the quarter. The operating margin was particularly strong in the Distribution business. And by your account, this wasn't an outsized quarter for exclusive launches per se. And I know you mentioned the timing around the antitrust and the manufacturer compensation, I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about the drivers of that margin in the quarter. And then what things should we be thinking about tempering in the back half relative to the revised guidance that you gave us?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, you are correct. The quarter was strong but it was particularly strong driven by just the timing of there being strong brand price increases, and that just pulls forward in most cases, what you would otherwise have expected to get over the course of the year from our brand manufacturers. The favorable antitrust settlement was a significant item that we certainly didn't expect to happen this early in the year. So those are really the 2 things, combined with the fact that, as you point out, it was really strong oral generics quarter as we all expected that drove the margin rate in the quarter so high. But since the first 2 of them really just have to do with timing, that's why you don't see that much change in our view for the year. And we've ticked up a little bit our expectation of the full year margin expansion in Distribution Solutions. But that's mainly driven by that change in our outlook on warehouse revenues because as our warehouse revenues come down a little bit, that does add a little bit to the margin.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, could you hazard a guess of market share for each of the franchises post-transaction? And then maybe secondarily, we've never seen PSS World's ROIC ever tick above 6%. Admittedly, it's been a comedy of strategic mishaps historically. But the $100 million synergy estimate just doesn't seem like, to me, that it gets -- gives you much leverage to ever improve that metric? So what's -- is there -- what can you say about the secret sauce here that really justifies the deal premium here?","John H. Hammergren","Well, Robert, I had a hunch you might have a view on the Medical-Surgical business given our history together. I don't think that if you actually look inside of our Medical-Surgical business, you'd see very healthy ROIC characteristics. And in particular, that business has gained significant momentum once we sold our acute care business. And so I think that we believe strongly that we can get a good return on the investment in PSS World Medical and that we also can continue to improve not only the ROIC of the acquired asset but the combined assets' ROIC will improve over time. And as you know, when we model acquisitions, we model acquisitions with a long-term view of our cost of capital and a very laser-like focus on our ability to continue to improve ROIC in the company. As it relates to the shares of these businesses, although we will be a very large player in all of our, alternate-site markets, they still are highly fragmented. And I would tell you that it remains extremely competitive in the marketplace. So I think that the combination of the 2 companies clearly is an opportunity for us to create value. But I don't think anybody should assume that this isn't going to remain a competitive industry in both extended care, primary care, home care, all the other alternate-site markets that we compete in.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you have a capital savings number, John, to go with that $100 million cost savings number?","John H. Hammergren","Well clearly, we would expect capital to be taken out of the business as we rationalize inventory investments and focus on credit and collections, the kinds of things that we do very well. And I'm sure we will be taking investment out. Now having said that, there will probably be some facility and other capital requirements as we go through this. But certainly, the day-to-day working capital should come down in the business.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a bit about, in the IT business, sort of the Paragon transition what you've seen so far, what the feedback's been, how you feel about sort of the momentum you have in that side of the software hospital market?","John H. Hammergren","Sure, Ross. The Paragon transition is a part of our, MPT business, which is a part of MTS. And Paragon is our electronic medical record and health care information systems product lines, both the financial and the clinical, for, primarily, the hospital or IDN marketplace. The transition you're referring to is our work with our customers to migrate them from our Horizon platform for clinicals to the Paragon platform for clinicals because we believe it drives a significant amount of efficiency, and it's a lot less costly to own and to operate. That transition has gone well for us in the marketplace. We have had some customer attrition, primarily driven by customers' requirements that Paragon doesn't currently have. But I think that customers that have transitioned to Paragon have great confidence that we will continue to build out our capability, particularly in the nonhospital part of the applications that need to be built in ambulatory. So I would say that we're on, or ahead, of our business case in that transition across the board. There have been some customer losses in that segment or that product line, but I would tell you that, that attrition is in line with our expectations.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Can you give us some color on the CVS RFP process? And secondly, with the implied second half guidance a little bit lower than we expected, is it just solely a function of the pull forward of the $19 million benefit in the price increases? And was the timing of the Rite Aid renewal factored into that updated guidance as well?","John H. Hammergren","As we discussed in our earlier remarks, we typically don't talk about our customers or our competitors' customers, for that matter, relative to their status, relative to contracting. So I guess I would say that on a global basis, we remain committed to the renewal of our customer base and to competing them the full value that we deliver for our customers over time. We have a long track record of renewing our relationships. About 1\/3 of our business every year comes up for renewal, and our track record of success in that has been, I think, very good. And so we would hope that we would continue to earn the privileges serving our customers, and that's, I guess, my view. And Jeff, maybe you could talk a little bit regarding quarters?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Sure. I think, Ricky, relative to where we started the year, there's probably 4 things that have pulled forward, just from a timing perspective, into the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. So you've got the manufacturer economics driven by the way our agreements work in some of the strong brand price increases that many people have commented on in the marketplace. We did have the favorable antitrust settlement, which was sizable, a $19 million settlement. We have seen the tax discrete items that we anticipated for the year would be much more front end or first half-loaded than we expected. And last, although much smaller, as I also mentioned, we do, just the timing of how we're managing our balance sheet, we expect to do a little bit of debt refinancing in the back half, that's going to tip our interest expense up a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, that's independent of how we ultimately choose to finance the PSS transaction. So those items really are what caused us to feel we are solidly on track with our plan for the year. It has ended up a little bit more front end-loaded than we had expected, but we feel good about our numbers for the full year.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from George Hill with Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, following up on Lisa's question a little bit, just big picture. You guys have just made a $3 billion commitment to the ambulatory setting or the physician practice market. Just can you tell us how does McKesson think about the longer term viability of the physician practice market and the direction of the independent physician practices, given the acquisition of PSS and Med3000?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we believe that the physician market is going to remain very robust. And in fact, if you actually think about what's going on in the marketplace, particularly the consolidation of physicians into the acute care setting, it's really an indication of the importance those physician practices, the important role those physician practices play in the total delivery of health care. If you don't have a line of physicians in the care network, you're never going to get at the issue of cost and quality and health care the way that we need to as a nation. And so we believe strongly that the physicians are going to remain in more and more demand. There aren't enough of them to satisfy the patient demands that are out there today. And demographics are only going to increase the import of physicians. I want to be clear in my view on this relative to the -- where physicians might reside, whether they're large physician groups in clinic settings, or they're parts of surgery centers, or they're acquired by hospitals in their -- in the satellite of those hospitals. And we don't believe that our business model is impacted negatively at all. And in fact, if anything, as our customers become more sophisticated, our sophisticated solutions meet their needs. We probably agree with a general view that physician practices that are 1 or 2 folks in a box down the street are probably under some pressure to aggregate either into a health care system or into a practice group of some kind. But we've been growing nicely in those settings. And you've seen these consolidation and physician practices underway perhaps for the last several years, yet you've seen McKesson's ability to grow through that because we'd come at the solution set with a more robust set of tools for our sales forces and our management teams to use to meet the needs of our customers. So these ambulatory customers that are being acquired, I think, will be as, or more, dependent on the services McKesson can provide as compared to the past. And on the Med3000 acquisition, or our REMS business, frankly, most of the physicians in those businesses are physicians that are already practicing in hospitals. They're emergency room doctors, they're anesthesiologists, they're radiology doctors. And so I think that this movement into a more connected health care system from a delivery perspective, and once again, if anything, a positive on what we do there because our customers are aggregating together in larger settings. And the complexity of what they're doing with -- from a billing and payment perspective, is only increasing. So I think that our skill sets fit perfectly with where we think health care is going, and we're excited to bring these assets together.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","And John, I might just add 1 financial comment, which is if you combine the $2.1 billion we're spending on PSS and Med3000, you don't get anywhere near a number that would round to $3 billion. So I know we haven't broken out, in fairness, George, the purchase price on Med3000, but I would tell you we wouldn't get anywhere near that range.","John H. Hammergren","Yes. When you said immaterial, with -- materiality would certainly start below $1 billion for that increment.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Jeff, let's just assume for simplicity, this deal closes at the beginning year, fiscal '14's. What, say -- we can probably back into these numbers, but I'd like to get your take on what sort of EBITDA contribution you would think about for PSSI in fiscal '14 as well as what the first year synergies might look like?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, I think, John, I don't probably want to go beyond the comments I made in my script, which is if it were to close March 31, we'd expect the transaction, if you were to assume it was fully debt-financed at 4%, to be $0.15 to $0.25 accretive on an adjusted basis. And our very rough estimate right now in terms of intangible amortization, it'd probably be about $100 million a year. So you could -- the synergies in this case do happen over a more extended period of time than we see in many of these kinds of transactions because as John, I think, has really articulated, there's a lot of good things at both companies that we are going to very thoughtfully think about as we go through how to take the best of both companies and create something of real value for our customers. So the synergies will be relatively modest in year 1 and then grow significantly as the years go by. So I think I'd probably prefer to leave my comments at that, and you can probably take a good cut at the EBITDA based on those.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","It looks like the operating expenses within the Distribution division came in better than I was looking for, maybe an improvement sequentially, can you talk about what drove that? Was that, possibly, tape synergies? And then also, was there any benefit on a relaunch of generic oxaliplatin in the quarter? And then just lastly, the U.S. Pharma bulk revenue came in later than I was looking for, maybe a sequential decline there, was that driven mainly by generics? Maybe 5 fewer days? Or was there something else going on there?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","I'll tick those off one at a time. On expense, there's really no single driver of the good expense management in Distribution Solutions other than all of our businesses and what is always a competitive environment really, doing a great job of managing across the board. On oxaliplatin, I would say, yes, it relaunched. And yes, that was in our results. It is not particularly material to us. And certainly, the economics around it are nothing like what the industry saw on its previous launch. So it's certainly a nice thing, but it is not -- nothing like last time. On bulk, you are correct that relative to our original expectations, our warehouse revenues were a little softer. There's really a couple of things going on. They vary a lot from quarter-to-quarter because it's driven by the purchasing patterns of a handful, less than a handful really, of big customers. All of those big customers have much broader relationships with us with lots of direct buying as well. So sometimes they choose to buy more direct and less warehouse, and that's actually a good thing for us. But it drops the warehouse revenue line. And then, the third thing going on there is we have seen, on some of the new generic launches, a little bit larger dropoff in our warehouse revenues due to those launches than we had anticipated. So that's not something that has a material impact on the bottom line, but does impact that revenue line.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can I just -- maybe a more market question for you, John. And it really, so I guess, the med-surg. And obviously, we're hearing some comments about sort of weak utilization volumes in the market from companies across many subsectors, health care. Can you give us some comments on what you're seeing, I guess, first in the physician market? And then secondly, maybe more broadly, what you're seeing across all your businesses?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we have -- I think we have a pretty good dial tone on what's going on in health care because of the breadth of our service offering. And as we talked about earlier, with the Med3000 acquisition and our REMS business, where we actually do patient office billing. We have a pretty good insight into the actual frequency of visits and the types of visits that might be going on. I don't think we've seen a significant change in the cadence of health care this year compared to last, and I think that we haven't seen a big change in the last quarter compared to the quarter before that. So I think our businesses actually have been performing quite well, and we have not seen a real step-down now. And clearly, there might be soft spots in certain parts of the market, but overall, we're pleased with our performance and pleased with what we see.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So -- and just a follow-up there. When you talk about the flat year-over-year, where -- on the res, we're saying it's solely the 5 less business days and -- and within that 8% underlying growth, you wouldn't point to any kind of softness, that it could have been stronger had utilization been better or you're saying that's just been pretty steady?","John H. Hammergren","Yes. I think the 8% is reflective of a slightly better-than-market growth, but we still think that markets are growing in the 4% to 6% kind of range. And that we're competing in a way that is allowing us to grow slightly faster. But I think overall, we still feel good about it. The flatness in the revenue and distribution is driven primarily by generics. And so that when you think about the corporation overall and our ability to grow revenue, it has been impacted by generics, which is a positive thing on the gross margin in the operating income line, but is dampening our revenues. So we'll see that dampening continue through the year and then as we start to go into next year, our revenue line should begin to grow again as generics begin to taper off, at least from this year.","I want to thank you all for your time and your questions today, I thought they were terrific. I'm certainly pleased with our accomplishments during the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for some discussions about upcoming events.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 15, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix. And on January 7, we will present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and the full year. After James comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results amortization acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.

Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Our fourth-quarter results wrap up another year of outstanding earnings growth led by strong performance in our Distribution Solutions segment. For the full year, revenues increased 30% to $179 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29% over the prior year to $11.11.","Fiscal 2015 was an exceptional year across McKesson as we deepened our relationships with our customers and manufacturing partners while expanding our scale in global reach. There are many achievements to highlight, but to name just a few.","In fiscal 2015 we formally secured operating control of Celesio and created a global sourcing and procurement office in London. This office will lead our efforts since we partner with manufacturers to more efficiently and effectively provide pharmaceuticals across a wide variety of markets and geographies.","During the year we demonstrated the strong value we provide to our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers as we successfully operationalized our agreement with Rite Aid and entered into an expanded relationship with Omnicare for both the sourcing and distribution of brand and generic pharmaceuticals. Our Medical-Surgical business met or exceeded all of our year two integration priorities related to the PSS acquisition, driving significant efficiencies in our IT and distribution infrastructure while maintaining the exceptional level of service our customers expect. We drove market-leading growth in our specialty business, expanding our position across oncology, rheumatology and ophthalmology and extending our track record of annual growth for new physicians joining the U.S. Oncology Network, and we continue to work alongside a growing number of partners in the CommonWell Health Alliance where we are beginning to see real-world progress in making the promise of data interoperability a reality.","In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year and continued our strong track record of creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2015. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership and constant focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything we do.","Today we also provided fiscal 2016 guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 per diluted share, representing an expected increase of 12% to 16% in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. This plan reflects strong growth across our businesses on top of the exceptional results in fiscal 2015. I'm excited about the outlook for our business and the momentum we have for fiscal 2016. We have a tremendous number of opportunities ahead of us, and I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver innovative solutions that help our customers drive better business health.","Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment, the key themes of an aging population are rise in chronic diseases and the challenge of containing costs remain important in the evolution of our industry. Against this backdrop it is encouraging to see great innovation taking place. Pharmacies continue to expand their value as convenient sites of care for patients by providing an ever-increasing set of services to help consumers better manage their health. In turn, consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare. With higher deductible plans becoming more prevalent and consumers playing a larger role in the selection of their health insurance through employers or exchanges, people are increasingly looking for transparency and data as they make more informed healthcare choices.","The policymakers have set meaningful direction to support a transition to value-based care in the United States. Recently Congress overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2 which permanently replaces Medicare's sustainable growth rate system. The bill, which was signed by the President, provides needed reimbursement stability and predictability for providers in the near term while they transition to a more incentive-based payment system by the year 2019. The bill also contains provisions for healthcare data interoperability among other important provisions. I believe the passage of these measures and the bipartisan support for continued reforms intended to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery in our country will continue to spur business innovation to solve healthcare's most critical challenges of cost, quality and access.","McKesson stands unique in the industry for our depth of our relationships and strength of our experience across healthcare, and this positions us well to help our customers navigate ongoing challenges and emerge as stronger, more effective businesses.","Moving now to our business results for the fourth quarter and the full year, Distribution Solutions had another excellent year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. On a constant currency basis, full year fiscal 2015 Distribution Solutions revenue increased 33% and full year adjusted operating profit increased 31% compared to the prior year. Although adjusted operating margin in this segment declined modestly year-over-year, driven primarily by the impact of the mix of hepatitis C drugs, we remain confident in our ability to consistently expand operating margin over time.","North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the year with 17% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2015, driven by the strong expansion of our generics business including growth of approximately 40% in our one-stop proprietary generics program. We are proud to be a full-service generic sourcing and distribution partner to an increasing number of our customers. Fiscal 2015 provided a visible platform for our U.S. Pharmaceutical team to demonstrate their ability to drive strong value to our in-house proprietary sourcing expertise and to drive efficiencies throughout the supply chain while strengthening the service levels our customers enjoy.","In fiscal 2015 we also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation in return. And Health Mart maintained its strong record of growth during fiscal 2015 ending the year with nearly 3,800 stores or approximately 15% growth over the prior year.","In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2015. In addition to maintaining market-leading position in pharmaceutical distribution in Canada, we continue to grow our extensive network of banner independent pharmacies across Canada where we now serve approximately 1,900 participating stores.","The expansion of our private label generic pharmaceutical offering under the Sivem brand continues to exceed our expectations. And we're pleased with the exceptional growth and the expansion of our Canadian specialty business in fiscal 2015 which now includes more than 85 Inviva infusion clinics across Canada.","Turning now to our U.S. Specialty business. In fiscal 2015 results were strong driven by growth across our portfolio of assets included in our oncology business as well as other specialty categories such as rheumatology and ophthalmology. I'm also pleased to report we continue to grow the number of physicians who choose to joined and further strengthen the U.S. Oncology Network. For the fourth year in a row, Black Book ranking placed McKesson's iKnowMed as the number one oncology electronic health record in the market.","We continue to expand our services to both payers and manufacturers. We are working with payers using innovative payment models that tie quality to outcomes and have secured multiple contracts for value-based reimbursement in oncology care. And with manufactures we continue to be a key partner to our clinical trial research network and our comprehensive manufacturer facing solutions including commercial support, product distribution support and patient services.","I want to acknowledge that there has been quite a lot of talk of late regarding biosimilars. We expect the biosimilar landscape to evolve over time and we believe this new category will play a growing role in the specialty market. The success of each biosimilar drug and drug class has many dependencies, including the channel of delivery, the disease which the drug addresses, physicians' views on quality and efficacy and the value delivered by various participants in the supply chain.","Our comprehensive service offerings and capabilities put McKesson in an excellent position to provide value in this exciting and evolving market. In summary, North American pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 we expect high single digit revenue growth compared to the prior year.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues were $26.4 billion for the full year, an increase of 5% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the last five months since formally gaining operating control of Celesio. Our London-based procurement organization is off to a solid start and we still expect to generate between $275 million and $325 million in synergies by the end of fiscal 2019.","We are making important long-term investments to upgrade the information technology infrastructure across Celesio and we continue to invest in refreshing our existing retail pharmacy footprint creating a differentiated health focused experience in our pharmacies and we are encouraged to see signs of more stable performance in important markets by Germany.","And as previously announced, we have launched a sale process for the Brazilian businesses, PanPharma and Oncoprod, which are now reported in discontinued operations. For fiscal 2016 we expect that the international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue will be roughly flat compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis.","I'm pleased that our Celesio businesses are performing well and are well-positioned to execute on their operating plans and priorities. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered solid results with 5% growth in revenues in fiscal 2015. We have now completed year two of our three-year PSS World Medical integration plan and I'm pleased to report the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on all fronts.","The Medical-Surgical team made significant progress in the integration distribution center network, migrations of critical IT systems and harmonization of our product portfolios in fiscal 2015.","Fiscal 2016 represents the third and final year of integration work and we expect to complete consolidation of our distribution network and further integration of key IT systems across the business this year. I remain extremely impressed with our Medical-Surgical team and our ability to grow and expand the strong relationships we are privileged to have with our customers while keeping operational excellence at the center of everything that we do. For fiscal 2016 we expect Medical-Surgical revenue growth in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Overall I'm proud of our full-year operating performance in Distribution Solutions and believe we have strong momentum as we enter the new fiscal year.","As we look ahead to fiscal 2016 we expect that Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase by mid-single digits compared to the prior year, and we expect adjusted operating margin to expand by low double digit basis points compared to the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% to $3.8 billion. Full-year adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $486 million. We remain encouraged by the strong results we see, particularly in our Relay Health Pharmacy and Connectivity businesses and our Payer Solutions business and by the signs of stabilization and growth that we see in our Medical Imaging business. At the same time we continue to take steps to further refine our portfolio of businesses.","Our fiscal 2015 results were impacted by the anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, the planned elimination of a product line and the previously disclosed wind down of our international technology business. Looking forward to fiscal 2016 we expect Technology Solutions revenue to decline by mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in our Connectivity, Payer Solutions, Medical Imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be offset by an expected decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of another business line. However, we expect adjusted operating margin in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2016 to the low end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of high teens. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better enable care and better enable connectivity.","To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan for our fiscal 2016 that reflects growth across our broad portfolio of businesses. And we expect that both of our segments will expand operating margin and will reach the initial part of the range for the long-term adjusted operating margin targets we outlined at our investor day last June. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth we expect across our businesses, and finally we are in businesses that continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2016. I'm confident in our teams' ability to continue to deliver value to customers and the strong financial returns for our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70, representing 12% to 16% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard we are very pleased by our results for the quarter and for the full year. Our results reflect strong growth in our adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share driven by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. In addition, our capital structure remained a source of financial strength as we generated strong operating cash flow and continued to leverage our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Today I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2016. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses.","Before I begin, there are two aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention. First, our current year and prior year financials were recast to exclude the results of Celesio's operations in Brazil. The results from our business in Brazil and other businesses held for sale are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Brazil's operations drove a loss from discontinued operations per diluted share of approximately $0.10 for the quarter and for the full year. As part of the decision to sell the Brazilian business, we also recorded a $235 million after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of this business to its estimated net fair value. This impairment charge generated a loss of $0.99 per diluted share from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter and full year.","Second, during the fourth quarter the euro traded at an average exchange rate of $1.12 per euro versus our prior expectation for a rate of $1.15 per euro. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar generated an incremental negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.03 to our adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter versus our prior expectation.","Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2015 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $11.11, which excludes four items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 19% for the quarter and 30% for the full year to $179 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% for the quarter to $3 billion, driven principally by an additional month of contribution from Celesio as we closed the acquisition in February 2014 of the same quarter last year.","For the full year, adjusted gross profit increased 36% to $11.8 billion, primarily driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth, including strong execution in our Distribution businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 9% for the quarter, driven mainly by the inclusion of an additional month of Celesio's operating expenses given the timing of our acquisition, as previously mentioned. For the full year, excluding the impact of Celesio, consolidated adjusted operating expenses increased 1%. Other income for the full year totaled $65 million.","Full year adjusted interest expense increased 47% versus the prior year to $374 million, primarily driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. For fiscal 2016, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be less than the prior year based on $1.5 billion of planned debt repayments.","Now moving to taxes, for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 30.6%, which reflects our mix of income and a number of discrete tax items. Our fiscal 2016 earnings outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%, which is based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international earnings; however, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $11.11. Overall, this year's adjusted earnings per share benefited significantly from our mix of business, specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings, and the contribution from our acquisition of Celesio.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. During the fourth quarter we completed a $340 million share repurchase, which fully exhausted the previously-granted board authorization. In addition, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization amount of up to $500 million. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2016 is 236 million. We expect to continue our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment while addressing upcoming significant debt maturities.","Specific fiscal 2016 capital allocation priorities are as follows. Planning for existing debt maturities and thereby maintaining our investment-grade ratings, investing in our current businesses and reviewing opportunities to pursue value creating M&A.","Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. On a constant currency basis, Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 23% for the quarter and increased 33% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business. During fiscal 2016, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by a mid-single digit percentage over the prior year driven by expected market growth and our mix of business.","North American distribution business revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. For the full year, revenues increased 17% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business including revenues from the sale of drugs used in the treatment of hepatitis C.","For fiscal 2016, we expect our North American distribution of business to deliver a high single digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal 2015. For the fourth quarter, international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 30% on a reported basis and 51% on a constant currency basis to $5.9 billion, reflecting one additional month of revenues as we closed our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014.","For the full year, the underlying revenues of Celesio increased by 5% on a constant currency basis. For fiscal 2016, we expect Celesio's constant currency revenues to be approximately flat to the prior fiscal year.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 5% for the quarter and the full year driven by market growth. We continue to execute against our three-year PSS integration plan and perform well against our synergy business case. During fiscal 2016, we expect to complete the final year of our integration plan while delivering mid-single digit percentage revenue growth year-over-year.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 46% for the full year on a 31% increase in segment revenues resulting in a 58 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year.","On a constant currency basis, segment adjusted gross profit increased 48%. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 59% on a reported basis and 62% on a constant currency basis for the full year driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and by the strong revenue growth within our North American distribution business.","Excluding the impact of Celesio, our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 3% versus the prior year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect continued growth in segment adjusted operating profit driven by the contribution from our generic business specifically from expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts.","In addition, we expect branded pricing trends to be consistent with the prior year and anticipate generic drug pricing trends slightly below those observed in fiscal 2015.","The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 243 basis points, a decline of five basis points over the prior-year. This decline was primarily driven by a higher volume of branded drug sales including the sale of hepatitis C drugs and a lower than expected contribution from Celesio.","Excluding the impact of the hepatitis C drugs, the segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 255 basis points for the quarter, up 7 basis points from the prior year.","Distribution Solutions full year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $4.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 238 basis points, a decline of three basis points over the prior-year. Again, this decline was driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, in particular hepatitis C drugs. Excluding the impact of these hepatitis C drugs, segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 247 basis points, an increase of six basis points over the prior year. For fiscal 2016, we expect Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to expand low double digit basis points compared to the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 10% for the quarter and down 8% for the full year to $3.1 billion. This full year decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline by a mid-single digit percentage as year-over-year growth in our payer-facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of a business line.","Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 14% for the quarter and 9% for the full year as a result of various cost management and restructuring initiatives. For the full year, adjusted operating profits decreased 8% to $486 million, primarily due to a lower revenue base and the wind-down of our U.K. Workforce business. Our full year adjusted operating margin remained flat to the prior year at 15.8%. During fiscal 2016, we expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased three days to 26 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days and our days sales in payables was approximately flat versus the prior year at 54 days. Our working capital management is illustrative of our continued focus on cash generation. During fiscal 2015, we reported $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. We ended the year with a cash balance of $5.3 billion with $2.3 billion held offshore. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016.","Internal capital spending totaled $545 million for the full year, which includes spending related to Celesio. For fiscal 2016, internal capital spending is projected to be between $600 million and $650 million as we continue to develop our information technology infrastructure across McKesson and make incremental investments related to our retail pharmacy operations.","Now I would like to briefly review some important considerations regarding our acquisition of Celesio and the related synergy case. Our current fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates making measured progress towards achieving transaction synergies of $275 million to $325 million by the end of fiscal 2019. And as a reminder, the vast majority of these synergies represent procurement-related savings from our global sourcing efforts.","You might recall that subsequent to achieving operating control in December 2014, McKesson consolidates 100% of Celesio's net income, and in exchange we are obligated to pay an annual guaranteed dividend of \u20ac0.83 per share to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders. And today, while we continue to consolidate 100% of Celesio's results from continuing operations, it is important to note that for fiscal 2016 we expect our ownership of Celesio to remain unchanged at 76%.","Our dividend obligation to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders will be recorded controlled in the line titled net income attributable to non-controlling interest on Schedule 1 and is expected to drive a fiscal 2016 expense of approximately $44 million or about $11 million per quarter assuming our 76% ownership stake at an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro.","Now before I conclude, I would point out that in today's press release we detailed the key assumptions underlying our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70. As always, our plan includes certain risk but overall we see significant opportunities to create continued value for our shareholders, customers and business partners in fiscal 2016.","Our plan calls for outstanding growth on fiscal 2015 results that were exceptionally strong and represents adjusted EPS expansion of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow up to allow others an opportunity to participate.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you very much for taking the question. John or Jim, maybe just a little bit on Celesio. You guys \u2013 Celesio has put forward the plan to delist the shares. How should we think about how that accelerates whether or not investors in Europe are going to put the shares back to McKesson? And, I guess, can you guys provide us any update on when we might expect to see the shares delisted?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, George, I think the objective we have is to focus on down listing now and it will probably lead or could lead to delisting in the end but our focus now is to down list. It provides certain efficiencies and it streamlines some of our reporting requirements in Europe. As to how the minority shareholders may behave as a result of this, it certainly would be speculation on my part. As you know they have a price that's already been fixed through this process that they can put their shares to us and clearly we'd have an obligation to buy them at those prices and to the extent that this accelerates their interest in doing so then we have to have the wherewithal available to us to make that transaction possible, but I guess other than that I don't have much else to say about it.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow up would be, you are a few more months now into your majority ownership of Celesio. Any kind of surprises or anything new the company's learned either to the positive or the negative side? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question. I appreciate it. I think that as you might have noticed in the quarter we announced that we were going to put for sale our Brazilian assets and I think that's an example of what McKesson typically does in these types of situations, is to look carefully at the portfolio of businesses that are represented, particularly in a large asset like Celesio, and begin to focus our efforts and our management team on those assets that we believe will deliver the best long-term value for our company and for our shareholders. And as such this portfolio modification or optimization was contemplated and announced as a result.","We continue to be very encouraged by the progress we're making in the U.K., in particular in our retail strategies. Several of our other markets are performing well and we are continuing I think to make progress. You may have noticed in the conversation, I talked about the revenues being relatively flat and it's principally driven by two factors, and that is in addition to the Brazilian operation going into discontinued ops, the Norway business loss, the large hospital customer, which affected our revenues in that market, and we also continue to have some challenges in the French market as reimbursement continues to be a pressure point there. But I would say that we see signs of Germany continuing to stabilize and as I mentioned the U.K. business in particular is performing well.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. John, can you maybe just give us an update on the London procurement operation? At what point, what percentage of contracts have you signed, I mean just to give us an indication as to how much more work you have to do on the procurement side?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you know, we were delayed in getting operational control of Celesio, so it delayed our ability to really begin to execute against the procurement synergies that we believe exist for us as we create a global footprint and a single relationship with these manufacturers on a global basis. And so that work was delayed. As I mentioned, we've launched that opening of that office in January. We're in the midst of our discussions with, as you might imagine, the very largest of our manufacturing partners, talking about how we can streamline the relationship between our companies and make sure that they win when we win, and those discussions are probably too early to describe relative to how far along we are or certainly percentages of completion.","I would say that we're getting a terrific response, however, and the manufacturers are eager to work with a company like McKesson where we can deliver such significant value. And I think it also helps that we can sort of have a unified message globally with what we're trying to do. And clearly our footprint in the U.S., our strength with Rite Aid, our strength with Omnicare, our Health Mart capabilities, I mentioned the 1,900 banner pharmacies in Canada along with the several thousand pharmacies in Europe, both owned under the Lloyds brand as well as franchised, give us a significant footprint that manufacturers are very interested in. So I'm excited about the early progress and we'll clearly keep you guys informed as we continue to make progress.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in fact just staying on that generic theme, I was surprised to hear in fiscal 2016 you expect generics to be below 2015. Is that because of the timing of the way Nexium came in, or am I missing something as I just look at what's expected to lose patent protection over the next 12 months?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question. I think we actually expect more dollar value of generic launches, or I should say branded generic launches \u2013 launches of branded drugs in fiscal 2016 than there were in 2015. So you're right, there's more dollar value of product going generic. I think as we look at our portfolio of generic estimates, we frankly see the character and characteristics of some of those generics being not quite as favorable for us as the launches that took place in FY 2015.","So an example would be a generic that might have many, many participants, and the value back to the supply chain as a result of that competitive activity wouldn't be as great. So I would just say there are some nuancial differences between our view of the portfolio of generics. It's not so much size-based as it is characteristic of the launches.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks, John.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. You're obviously ending with a cash balance very strong, over $5 billion. It looks like the free cash flow you're calling for in fiscal 2016, about $2.4 billion. And based on your comments, both John and James, it sounds like maybe share repurchases for next year aren't quite as high a priority as M&A. I'm curious if A, there's anything specific leading to this maybe slight re-prioritization for next year? And then, John, I guess more importantly, can you share maybe what in your mind are the priorities right now as you think about where you maybe want more exposure across healthcare?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't I start with the answer and let James fill in some of the details. Clearly based on our belief at this point and what we've described as our expectations for fiscal 2016, we will have a very strong balance sheet at the end of the year. We've also talked about our priority related to maintaining investment grade. We did talk in the call about debt that's going to be extinguished this year as it comes due and in an earlier conversation we talked about the rights of the minority shareholders of Celesio. So there are some uses of capital including internal investment that James and I have described for fiscal 2016 that will consume some of this financial strength.","We've also talked over time about our \u2013 in addition to the priority of remaining investment grade, the priority of high-value transactions and the ability for McKesson to execute on those transactions in a strategic way that produces very positive returns, above our cost of capital returns, for our shareholders. And that remains a priority as well. And we did talk about the board approving a $500 million repurchase, which is not insignificant as it relates to share buybacks. So I think you'll continue to see us unfold our strategy as the year goes on and we're cognizant of the fact that our balance sheet remains a source of opportunity for us and we plan to use that opportunity judiciously on behalf of our shareholders.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just further emphasize that I think it's helpful to have some cash balance flexibility to allow us to take advantage of attractive M&A if it should come along during this period of delevering.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's fair. And I guess just a quick follow up on some of the comments you made around follow-on biologics or biosimilars, John. I know you don't typically get into individual drug launches but given this is kind of the first of its kind, I was wondering if you could maybe share your thoughts around how you think about biosimilar in Neupogen coming to the market and whether or not there's anything factored into the guidance around that launch or potential launch I should say?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you hit in a very key comment there about potential launches. So I think that it relates to our fiscal 2016 guidance and the uncertainty related to biosimilars and their uptick we have nothing included in our guidance related to biosimilars. I would say that I think the company is well-positioned to hit the biosimilar space.","As you know, we have a very active specialty business and we have a complete array of services that could be provided to a bio similar manufacturer which we think will launch in a very similar way to branded manufacturers launches in terms of the support for patients, the special handling requirements, the reimbursement requirements, the physician contact that needs to happen. And we do that in a significant way today.","In addition, I might add any of the biosimilars that we'll be focused on the oncology market are particularly attractive to us because of our physician network. And the U.S. Oncology Network has a track record of helping branded companies come to market through our clinical trial work and we also have the ability to create formularies when they're convinced that from a clinical perspective the product can be selected and defined for the patients in a way that delivers best-in-class quality and lowest possible cost. So, I think that unique asset in US Oncology will play a role here over the years as biosimilars come to market in the oncology class.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It should be interesting to watch how it plays out. Thanks, John.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question, guys. John, I'm curious. It's \u2013 I know your business is kind of second derivative in nature but with King Burwell kind of weeks away from a decision of the Supreme Court, how would you view a negative Supreme Court ruling on ACA subsidies relative to your outlook on the core U.S. Pharmaceutical and Med-Surg business?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's been difficult for us all along to quantify ACA's effect on the demand in our businesses albeit we do believe there is a positive effect associated with people getting access to care in the fashion that ACA is providing. I would say that in my conversation with people on the Hill and at the state level around markets, I believe that the countries are going to have to position itself to take care of folks that are not able to afford their own care or to do so in a way that is an effective and efficient for the businesses and for our country.","And so I think the end result or even if something were to come from the Supreme Court ruling that may put a question mark on the subsidy or support for these patients I think that there'll be a quick reaction on the Hill to try to find another way to provide low-cost quality care to patients so they don't fall through the crack and end up in the emergency rooms in America. And I would remind also to the listeners that know this well that pharmaceutical use and the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals and primary care physicians is the best way to treat patients as opposed to letting them their situations falter and having them end up in an acute situation in one of our Great American hospitals and that I think needs to be avoided.","So, I think it's early to call but I think that this combined with the continued pressure from the demographic perspective and all the things that we see from a growth and opportunity perspective in our industry keeps me very excited about the future for McKesson.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And a quick follow up, flipping over the IT side of the business with the doc fix legislation and some of the focus there being on interoperability and what have you, what do you see as kind of the status of CommonWell and opportunities relative to both CommonWell continued move forward and revenue opportunities for Relay Health in particular as it relates to work that you guys do in there? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question. We are excited to be a participant in CommonWell, and as you know the CommonWell is a not-for-profit gathering of roughly 70% or so of the systems provider volumes in the country for physician offices and hospitals, and that aggregation of technology companies who have decided to come together and create a method by which we can move information between our non-native systems or between each other's competitors' systems, said another way, is a landmark opportunity for this country to actually get interoperability and exchange data in a way that's never been done before.","So this opportunity for McKesson, I guess, translates into our ability to continue to support CommonWell's mission through the services that have been offered by Relay Health, and Relay is one of probably many in the future providers of capabilities to CommonWell that will facilitate this movement of patient data and financial data that'll be very helpful.","So I'm quite excited about it. I'm frankly right now more excited about what it's going to do for healthcare in this country than I am necessarily for the revenues of Relay, which will follow over the years. But I think the adoption curve is going to be steep and I think people are going to benefit from CommonWell's efforts.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter and guidance. A couple follow-up questions. First on the Tech Solutions, so, John, obviously you expressed your excitement around CommonWell, but when you think about the Tech Solutions segment in performance over the last few years, when you think about the different parts of the business does the segment still fit strategically with the rest of the McKesson portfolio?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Why, I think the way we think about our technology businesses is the value that it delivers to customers and our ability to make sure that we're delivering against those needs. As we think about the overall portfolio of McKesson's companies, you can see that we are always active in our management of that portfolio, and that's frankly one of the reasons that the Technology Solutions segment, which is an aggregation of many different companies, revenue has been down as a result of that portfolio activity. But there are assets in there that are very directly correlated to other business unit strategies in our corporation.","It could be things like our Relay pharmacy business, which is the connectivity provider for most of America's pharmacies, or it could be our outsourcing business for physician offices, which is heavily correlated with our practice management activities where we're supporting the efforts of community oncology or community physician work, and then there's other businesses that may not be as correlated to the strategy of the rest of our businesses, and in those cases the key for us is can we optimize the performance of those companies as standalone companies vis-\u00e0-vis their competitors.","So I don't ever rule anything in or out on any of our businesses relative to our strategy. I think I look at it as an evolution, and we need to continue to do so, and we need to make sure that we optimize the value and the performance of these businesses on behalf of our shareholders.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And one follow up that's related to questions that we're getting from investors. Obviously there's a lot of chatter out there about potential M&A of some clients of yours and some of them have longer-term contracts. So do these contracts typically have a change of control clause in them? If you can just clarify that.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the industry's going to continue to be filled with chatter and clatter related to strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions, and certainly people in our healthcare industry that promulgate some of these discussions and rumors more than others. McKesson as a policy, really doesn't \u2013 we don't talk about our customer contracts, and we certainly don't talk publicly about M&A or potential M&A.","We have very solid relationships with our customers. We've earned the right to have their business for years and sometimes decades, and as you know, we've currently earned the right in several cases of expanding our relationship with our customers to include all of the purchasing of their generics and the distribution of their business.","And I might also note that we have a very broad base of customers. So we clearly, to the extent that we \u2013 that our relationship with one customer changes, hopefully we're at the same time expanding relationships with others. So all I can tell you is we stay close to our customers and in many cases if a customer changes from an ownership perspective, McKesson stays with that customer even into the new entity from a service perspective and you might recall, Ricky, when CVS purchased Caremark we were fortunate to have CVS continue the Caremark relationship with McKesson. So I think there are many examples where you will see M&A activity and McKesson maintains the relationship.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just from me just a quick question on the FY 2016 guidance. While EPS at the midpoint is just a touch below The Street consensus, it seems to me, it may just be due primarily to slightly higher tax rate year-over-year also that that flash share count $500 million buyback authorization. I my sense is investors probably are not going to be too concerned about but I guess for me just big picture, just curious that there's still potential for the combined company tax rate to still come down over the next few years despite the fact that they may be up a little in FY 2016. Thanks.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the tax rate guidance that we've offered for FY 2016 reflects the expected mix of profits between our international businesses, which tend to be taxed at a lower rate versus our domestic businesses. And recall, of course, those domestic businesses have been growing very nicely in recent years. And so that's a fact in the thought behind the 31.5% tax rate guide for fiscal 2016. We're not looking to try to project out beyond fiscal 2016 at this point in time.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, and good evening. I also wanted to follow up with one quick question on the guidance. It seems like one of the components of your guidance you talk about maybe lower pricing on the generic side in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. It's kind of nice to have a conference call that is not dominated about generic price inflation but, John, I'm kind of curious. Could you give us your perspective in terms of what you are seeing there? And are you actually seeing any changes in the market? Or do you just believe it's prudent to assume some level of normalization? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Glen, I think you hit the same word I was going to use and that was prudent. I think we've seen a very robust cycle of generic inflation at least as we view it. And clearly, we expect it to continue at least we expect it to moderate as we give our guidance for next year to the extent that our prudent guidance proves to be incorrectly low and then at some point we'll over achieve our expectations to the extent that we projected to be too high in our crystal ball, then we'll be disappointed with what happens with the generics. But I think overall we remain very optimistic about our portfolio and how we manage it and I think we get good job of forecasting where the business is going to be.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks very much. First I was just hoping that perhaps you could size the U.S. Specialty business and growth rate? But really my question is around specialty pharmacy. To be fair you have a specialty pharmacy operations ex-U.S. You interact with patients in U.S. Oncology. You own pharmacies, you have pharmacy franchises globally. So I'm just not sure why specialty pharmacy would truly be a foreign business to you, no pun intended on that or why you might not actually be interested in moving more in that direction and I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question. We are in the Specialty Pharmacy business in various aspects of our strategy. And certainly if you think about it globally, particularly where we own pharmacies we have specialty pharmacy activity and you pointed out oncology is one example. I think we've always been sensitive to supporting our customers and their activities and we are reluctant to compete with our customers in any real significant way. So to the extent that specialty pharmacy can support our overall strategy and not be in conflict with what our customers expect from us and we'll continue to pursue and it in certain areas it makes a lot of sense for us to be there and in other areas it makes sense for us to support other people's Specialty Pharmacy businesses.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Is there any chance I could get you to put some figures around the size of specialty overall in the U.S., and the growth rate, you did mention you were growing above market?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No chance.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","What do you think the market's growing?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Slower than we are.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Have a good night.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. So, sticking on sort of the international parts of the business, you've owned the asset now for some time, you guys have done a tremendous job historically of rolling up various industries and obviously you have plenty of firepower to do deals. What have you learned about the various geographies so far where you play and where you don't play? And what is sort of your view of Brazil? How did that impact your view in emerging versus more developed markets to move into with that asset? And then how would you characterize valuations in some of those geographies versus what we see in the U.S., so a kind of a broad-reaching question on the M&A outlook in some of those newer markets?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ross, that's a very interesting question and I think it has a very complex answer that is \u2013 that I'll try to deal with. I think the way we think about Europe is the way I think about McKesson 16 years ago when I landed in this seat. How do we \u2013 how can we optimize the performance of the businesses we have and focus on those businesses and then how do we branch from those businesses to adjacencies that we know how to operate in markets where we can compete. And I think the situation with Brazil, it was not obvious that we could create a market-leading strategy there particularly given the vertical nature of some of the retailers in that market. And nuances associated with the business models down there and clearly whether it was scaled properly, et cetera, that I think the conclusion was reached that we should have our focus on Europe and in those markets where we currently have a strong beachhead. And in many of those markets we're number one or number two already from a distribution or a retailing perspective. And in many of those markets the hospital business is still direct, the specialty business is nascent. There aren't a lot of services that are similar to what we provide here in the U.S., both to manufacturers and to the end customers. And so I think we do see an opportunity both through organic growth as well as M&A in several of those markets and that'll be part of our focus as we think about the strength of our balance sheet.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's perfect. It's 6 o'clock, so I'll end there.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. I know there are a few other folks that are still on the line hoping to ask questions. So if you want to go a little bit further I'm happy to do that.","Operator","We will go next to David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter. Can you just highlight again what the growth rate was in the OneStop Generics program? I thought I heard a very high number? And then maybe some descriptions around what drove that would be very helpful. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the OneStop program has been and continues to be very successful for us and this last year, the number I quoted was a 40% growth rate year-over-year, which was quite significant. Now, obviously a portion of that was our success with Rite Aid but the business still grew very significantly even outside of the Rite Aid business.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask on Health Mart. The growth of 15% seems much stronger than the market so what portion of this is due to market growth as you define it? And where is the remainder of the growth coming from? Is it more taking share or small change that you did, (62:06) some of these activities in-house that are now going to the Health Mart franchise? Can you just elaborate there a little bit?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Just to be clear, the growth rate was in store count not in revenue of those stores. And so the stores, I'm sure some of them did come from competitors but I would imagine there's a portion of them that just came from great customers that have been doing business with us for a while and realized that Health Mart added a bigger opportunity for us and for them, and that expansion of our footprint with them and the services we provide gave us a better position with those customers. So it expands our footprint at Health Mart across the country and our objective with our customers is hopefully to earn the privilege to be Health Mart for all of them, obviously with the exception of the large chains which are creating their own brands.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then the follow up is just a bigger picture question, of ongoing M&A among pharmaceutical manufacturers and what we read about in the press. To ask the question a little bit differently though, at what point would you begin to get concerned of too much consolidation in the pharmaceutical space?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm not concerned yet, and I would say that the manufacturing advantages (63:26) we have are very significant. Clearly to the extent that we can create value by delivering channel or volume to them, they're interested in working closely with us, and that's our objective. And I certainly don't see on the horizon a situation where manufacturers no longer need McKesson as part of their solution.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for sneaking me in there. A simple one would be, the London organization that you've created, is that independent from the international distribution business, meaning it doesn't roll up \u2013 the profits would roll up within the Celesio business?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Eric, I guess the best way to describe it is that it's a separate operation that is organized in London and it reports directly to Paul Julian, and its job is to focus on a global relationship with large global manufacturers. And as to the financial effect of those businesses, of this activity, you probably would find it in many different parts of our corporation, including maybe even Medical Supplies as we source globally for medical supplies and private label. So it really will \u2013 it'll end up in various P&Ls as success is reached there.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","At this time we have no further questions so I return the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I certainly want to thank everybody for their time today and for being on the call. I know we ran a little bit over but it was our year end and we spent a little time chatting, so I wanted to make sure that we spent some time making sure we have all of your questions answered. We think we have a very strong operating plan for fiscal 2016 and certainly exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I'm certainly proud of our track record of delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders and to each of you, and I'm certainly proud of our terrific McKesson team which continues to deliver year in and year out. So with that, I'll turn it over to Erin for upcoming events for the financial community.","Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, John. I have a preview of some upcoming events. We will participate at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas tomorrow, May 13, and the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 9. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and I'm delighted to welcome James Beer, McKesson's recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will provide the business update, who will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results: acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Late last night in the West Coast and early this morning for those of you on the East Coast, McKesson announced our agreement to acquire Celesio for a total consideration of approximately $8.3 billion. McKesson and Celesio will unite to form a global leader in healthcare services. Many of you are quite familiar with Celesio, but for those of you that are not, I want to take a moment to introduce you to this great company.","Celesio is a leader in pharmaceutical wholesaling with a presence in key markets across Europe and Brazil and an extensive network of retail pharmacies that are either owned or a part of a strong collaboration model throughout Europe. This transaction brings together the strengths and expertise of 2 leaders in global healthcare with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and a history as a trusted partner to customers dating back approximately 180 years.","The United States, Canadian and European healthcare services markets have been experiencing a number of forces driving change across healthcare delivery. Demographics are driving increased utilization. Governments and other payers are demanding more efficient and effective delivery of care, and consumers are more engaged in all aspects of the care continuum driven by access to information.","In response to some of the larger forces for change in healthcare, the industry has evolved rapidly, marked by convergence between segments and increased globalization. The combination of McKesson and Celesio will be well positioned to meet the increasing global nature of the pharmaceutical supply chain and continue to enhance our customers' ability to deliver better and more efficient healthcare services.","We are very excited about this transaction and the value it will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. Customers will benefit from increased supply chain efficiency, enhanced global sourcing and a broad array of innovative technology and business services. Our manufacturing partners and suppliers will benefit from access to new markets and the efficiency of a global distribution partner. And the employees of McKesson and Celesio will benefit from being part of an even stronger and larger global company.","So let me take a moment to walk through some of the important elements of the agreements we have announced today. McKesson will acquire the Haniel Group's entire stake in Celesio, representing approximately 50.01% of the outstanding shares of the company for EUR 23 per share in cash. McKesson has also agreed to launch parallel voluntary public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares and outstanding convertible bonds of Celesio. This transaction has been approved by McKesson's Board of Directors, the Haniel Group's Supervisory Board and Celesio's Supervisory Board.","The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions, including the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of 75% of the shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. James will provide more color on some of the financial elements of the transaction in his remarks, but I would highlight a couple of things.","First, the value and synergy in this transaction will happen over time. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control of Celesio, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. To give you a sense of the strength and scale of the business, the combined company is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $150 billion and more than 81,500 employees worldwide, along with operations in over 20 countries.","The business will report to Paul Julian, Executive Vice President and Group President of McKesson Distribution Solutions. Paul has skillfully led the Distribution Solutions segment of McKesson for the past 13 years, where he has overseen a period of tremendous revenue growth and profit expansion in our distribution businesses. These businesses have risen to become leaders in their markets, driven by Paul's focus on operational excellence and building the best leadership team in the industry.","In summary, we have a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend. The acquisition creates a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders.","Before I move on to our business results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to welcome James Beer to his first quarterly earnings conference call with McKesson. It has certainly been an exciting few weeks since James joined the company earlier this month, and I'm delighted to have an executive of his caliber and experience to lead our finance organization. James has enjoyed a successful CFO tenure at 2 prominent organizations, American Airlines and Symantec. And I know his experience and perspective will add tremendous value, as we complete the acquisition of Celesio over the coming year.","Turning now to our results for the quarter. Today, we reported strong second quarter results with total company revenues of $33 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.27. Based on our performance for the first half of the fiscal year and our improved outlook for the year, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $8.40 to $8.70.","Now I will turn our -- turn to our operations and provide some brief highlights from both segments of our business. Distribution Solutions revenue grew 11% for the quarter, and adjusted operating profit grew 18%. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 13% for the quarter, consistent with our expectations for strong growth for the year.","The quarter benefited from growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offering. We continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson, strong compliance to our generic programs and services, and strong growth in our OneStop Generics program. In the second quarter, we continue to experience favorable pricing on certain products in our generics portfolio, principally driven by a few products where there has been supply disruption. While we are confident in the continued strong performance of our total portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products and programs and the value we provide to our customers, it is difficult to predict larger environmental factors such as supply disruptions and manufacture behavior. That being said, in the updated guidance we provided to you today, we have assumed generic performance continues ahead of our original expectations for the second half of our fiscal year but at a moderated pace compared to the first half of the fiscal year. In summary, I'm proud of the performance of our U.S. pharmaceutical business, which continues to benefit from the excellence of our global sourcing capabilities and our relentless focus on operational excellence.","Our specialty business had solid results in the second quarter, and we continue to strengthen our position with our customers and our physician partners. We also saw strong growth in our Canadian business where revenues grew 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers. Our team in Canada has done a tremendous job of growing the business and expanding the value we provide to our customers. We have grown steadily and profitably in Canada over many years, even though the nature of the market and the role of government in healthcare are different from what we experienced here in the United States. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of the Canadian business in the first half of the fiscal year.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to make good progress with the acquisition of PSS, and I'm pleased with the solid results in the first half of our fiscal year. I recently joined the Medical-Surgical team at the Health Industry Distributors Association Annual Meeting. At the meeting, I had a chance to speak with some of our suppliers and hear directly about the expanded opportunities and efficiencies they experienced working with the combined Med-Surg and PSS teams.","We remain on track to deliver the value we had envisioned in the business case, and I'm very pleased with our team in the way they have executed against this plan, always remaining focused on taking care of our customers as the top priority.","In summary, we've had strong results in Distribution Solutions in the first half of the year. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year.","Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. We had solid results in the second quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating profit up 23% over the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin improved 214 basis points to 16.82%. We continue to benefit from a number of actions we took in the Technology Solutions segment and across the entire enterprise to better position the company for fiscal 2014. Second quarter results in Technology Solutions also benefit from a number of acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2013.","The acquisitions we completed last year, along with some of the internal changes to our organization, were all designed to better focus our efforts on our customers' most important priorities: empowering strategic and point of care decisions through business intelligence solutions; preparing for new risk-based payment models, better known as population health; providing tools and services to support value-based reimbursement; and enabling connectivity across the care continuum through interoperability. We continue to make good progress on all of these investments and initiatives, and I'm pleased with the results of our Technology Solutions business in the first half of the fiscal year. Our core businesses are performing well against our plan for the fiscal year, and we continue to invest in the solutions our customers will need to thrive going forward.","In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. Our businesses are performing very well. And today's announcement of our agreement to acquire Celesio makes us very well positioned to continue our leadership in healthcare, in the supply chain and in increasing global markets in which we serve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James Beer","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, McKesson's second quarter results represent another strong quarter of operating performance across the business. Based on this performance and our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2014, we have updated our full year guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our previous range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share. The Celesio acquisition represents an exciting step for McKesson, and we are confident this acquisition will only further compliment the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders.","Today, I will walk you through our second quarter consolidated financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook. And at the end of my remarks, I will review the key financial aspects of the transaction we announced today with Celesio.","My remarks will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.27, which excludes 4 items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments.","Before I begin, let me provide a brief update on our divestiture activity. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we discussed our intention to exit our International Technology business, our Hospital Automation business and our minority interest in Nadro. This quarter, we completed the transaction to sell our minority interest in Nadro, and subsequent to the close of the quarter, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Hospital Automation business. We continue to make good progress on the sale of our International Technology business and expect to provide an update later in the fiscal year.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $33 billion. On this 11% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 22% to $2.1 billion. Solid operating performance in the current year and results from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013 contributed to both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 23% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 4%. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense increased 7% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by $1.8 billion in notes issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013.","Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 33% is up from the prior year due to a number of discrete items and a slightly less favorable mix of income. I would remind you that adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. While our mix of domestic to foreign income has become less favorable this quarter, we are expecting a number of favorable discrete tax items during the balance of our fiscal year. We continue to expect a full year estimate of 31% for our fiscal 2014 adjusted tax rate. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.27.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 233 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. Given the planned acquisition of Celesio, we expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 233 million, as we now expect to not repurchase shares during the second half of our fiscal year.","Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 13% for the quarter to $23.7 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 14% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins.","Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 68% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. As John mentioned earlier, the combined business continues to perform very well.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 24% for the quarter on 11% revenue growth, resulting in a 56-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our second quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 31% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 257 basis points, an improvement of 15 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarterly variability in the segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first half performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be above the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $785 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 7% for the quarter, mainly due to the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the quarter was $110 million, up 3% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 9% a year ago. Second quarter adjusted operating profit was up 23% to $132 million, and the second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.82%, an increase of 214 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the contribution from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and favorable performance across the segment. For the year, we continue to expect to be within the high end of our mid-teens long-term adjusted operating margin goal.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 26 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days is down from 32 days a year ago, and our days sales in payables decreased by 2 days to 48 days.","We generated cash flow from operations of $813 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect the cash flow from operations will be approximately $2 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion with $1.6 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $197 million for the first half of fiscal 2014, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million.","Now let's turn to our outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance from our prior range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share from continuing operations. In addition, based on acquisitions closed to date, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.23 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.18 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.37 to $0.43.","Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned in his remarks, the process to complete the acquisition is different from acquisitions McKesson has done in the past. There are a few key steps in the process that are important to understand.","McKesson has entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Haniel Group, the majority shareholder in Celesio. McKesson has agreed to acquire the Haniel Group's stake in Celesio, currently representing 50.01% of the total outstanding shares of the company. McKesson has also entered into a business combination agreement with Celesio.","Pursuant to these agreements, McKesson will launch parallel public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares of Celesio for EUR 23 per share and for Celesio's outstanding convertible bonds due in 2014 and 2018 at the price corresponding to the value of the underlying shares implied by a EUR 23 per share offer price. The offer price per bonds due in 2014 equates to EUR 53,117.78 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 50,000. The offer price per bonds due in 2018 equates to EUR 120,798.32 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 100,000.","We expect these tender offers to commence during our fiscal third quarter and conclude during our fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2014. Both the stock purchase from the Haniel Group and the tender offers are subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of $0.75 of outstanding shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. Upon the successful conclusion of the tender offers, we will consolidate the financial results of Celesio, and our earnings will reflect our proportionate share of Celesio's earnings.","We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive in the first 12 months following the successful completion of the tender offers. This estimated range of accretion assumes we achieve 100% ownership of the shares of Celesio at the conclusion of the tender offers. Of course, the final range of accretion will depend on the actual results of the tender offers, the permanent financing structure selected and the estimated operating results of Celesio. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. As I said before, we will begin to consolidate the results of Celesio in proportion to the actual shares tendered when the tender offer process concludes.","Subsequent to the conclusion of the tender process, there are a number of required steps we are obligated to follow to obtain operating control of Celesio. We expect to complete these steps during fiscal 2015. Synergies will be achieved over time. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million.","Now let's discuss the transaction's financing. We expect to use our existing offshore cash to fund a portion of the transaction. We also expect to use a bridge facility to fund the balance of the tendered securities. The permanent financing structure will be determined by the timing and the number of Celesio shares and convertible bonds tendered. Additionally, McKesson is committed to maintaining its status as an investment-grade-rated company in considering the permanent financing structure. At this time, we intend to enter into financial instruments to partially hedge the foreign currency risk associated with Celesio's enterprise value. In the transaction announcement you have seen today, we have assumed a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.35. To give you a simple way to think about this, every 1% change in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate represents approximately $80 million in Celesio's total enterprise value. We consider many financial metrics when evaluating acquisition opportunities. And we believe this acquisition will provide a strong return on capital for McKesson's shareholders.","In summary, this is a very exciting time to be at McKesson. The core businesses are performing exceptionally well as demonstrated by our results in the first half and our confidence in the improved outlook for the full year. In addition, we expect the acquisition of Celesio to drive value for our customers, our manufacturing partners and of course, our shareholders.","Thank you, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","James, welcome. Nice way to start off your tenure. John, understanding that there's lot of changes in the global healthcare distribution landscape right now, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit or share with us your thoughts around the timing and why this transaction was right for McKesson to pursue right now.","John H. Hammergren","Well, thank you for the question, Robert. Clearly, these things have to be somewhat opportunistic, and when the opportunities arise, you have to be prepared to feel confident in your ability to execute. And so we have been traveling to Europe for my -- almost my entire tenure, and we've built our global sourcing businesses around the globe. And we've known the people who have been competing in Europe for quite some time. I think our success, both here in the United States as well as in Canada, relative to building relationships with our manufacturing partners, helping to deliver better supply chain efficiency and better sourcing power with relative to McKesson, has given us confidence that we can continue to take these skills and assist Celesio's tremendous management team and focus in the countries with a global platform. So as you mentioned in the beginning of your question, the world is more rapidly globalizing and consolidating, and clearly, McKesson needs to continue to have a leadership role around the world.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I guess, just my follow-up would be around the synergies. I'm sure there's a lot of work that went into assessing the potential synergy opportunities of these 2 combined companies. And specifically as it relates to generic procurement, I was hoping you'd give us a little bit of detail around the process you undertook in assessing the potential generic purchasing synergies. And then, I guess, just on the back of that more immediately, just so we understand, will McKesson and Celesio be purchasing generics as a single entity right away?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, as James highlighted in his discussions, that we have to get to operational control of the company before we can begin to combine our operations on a global basis. That doesn't mean that we can't begin to lay the groundwork today to be prepared for what we believe will be a successful transaction as we move forward. We have, I think, demonstrated not only this quarter but also in previous quarters and years our continued growing ability to manage the supply chain in a way that's effective for the partners that we've worked with over decades to grow the value we deliver to them in return. And I think that the sourcing capability that we have, both in generics as well as our relationships with the branded manufacturers and clearly, our strength with Northstar, are all proven capabilities. And we've, over the years, been able to transition that capability beyond the U.S. into our Canadian business to where, frankly, the markets are probably more European in their style and in their makeup than they are even here in the U.S. And we are able to take that supply chain expertise into a market that has a different regulatory and reimbursement regimen. So as we evaluated the opportunity in Celesio, clearly, we needed to look at individual markets. It's not a company that is operating the same way in each market, and we looked at the tremendous tenure and the track record of a company. It's nearly 180 years old. We met with the country managers and talked about how they're executing in their markets and got very confident -- comfortable and confident that this is not necessarily an operational turnaround that's going to require us to go in and fix the current business day to day in these markets. The Lloyds brand continues to grow in presence. They've had a European pharmacy network strategy that's building out nicely, and clearly, they've had an operational excellence program that is working well. It's not to say that we can't provide some things that will help. But I want to be clear on the fact that we have tremendous confidence in the Celesio management team's ability to continue to manage in the business. So what we're primarily we're focused on, as you point out, is the global supply chain synergies that we've outlined in this announcement, and we believe that based on our previous experience doing this and where we see the markets evolving and what others are doing in the marketplace, we're very comfortable and confident that we can reach these numbers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess, just sort of piggybacking on that last synergy question, are all the synergies anticipated or primarily anticipated to be coming from purchasing? Or are there any other buckets that we should be thinking about as well as what is the synergy target that you sort of got implied in that initial $1 to $1.20 of accretion in the first 12 months?","John H. Hammergren","Well, the principal and primary driver of our synergies is going to be the supply chain and sourcing activity that we outlined. I think it's probably fair to say, James, that the accretion number comes faster than the synergy numbers. So James, maybe you can talk about that.","James Beer","Yes, that's right. So the accretion range that I spoke about, the $1 to $1.20, that begins upon the completion of the successful tender. And we're looking for that to occur in Q4 of fiscal '14. Now based upon the process that we abide by under German law, it will be several months or so before we would actually be able to take operation control. So we'd be of the order of halfway through fiscal '15 before we were to able to exercise that operating control and have any access to synergies. And then I think it would be a case of synergies building gradually over that 4-year period that I spoke about such that in year 4, we'd be up of that $275 million to $325 million annual range, so quite a gradual ramp, a modest impact on fiscal '15.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then on the follow-up, John, I think during your prepared remarks, you mentioned that some customers were buying more generics through you. Can you expand on that comment and what you're seeing out there today? Do you anticipate there's the potential that some of the very big customers may be doing more and more through you or that there's even the opportunity to do something sort of like Walgreens and with ABC and take over the distribution entirely for some of the big customers, sort of the way this landscape is evolving?","John H. Hammergren","Well, you're clearly -- it's difficult to project what customers are going to do and what behavior they might have and what might be attractive to them. I would say that there's tremendous evidence in our track record that we've been able to move upstream with our customers, and ever larger customers are beginning to count on McKesson from a logistics perspective and a sourcing perspective. I'm carefully selecting my words here that logistics is certainly a part of the value that we can deliver to a customer. So even the very largest customers would probably benefit from our logistics expertise, and we can provide efficiency through that capability. The sourcing activity is actually the power we bring to a discussion with a customer relative to our scale and size and our ability to attract great manufacturing partners and help them gain market acceptance through their partnership with McKesson. That's a little bit different activity than truly the logistics. The key in our strategy is to marry the 2 together and bring that combined value to our customers. And having said all of that, clearly, the more scale we have, the larger our presence, the easier we are to do business with from a supply chain perspective and the more efficient we become globally and we can become a sort of a one-stop shop for people to create global partnerships, those partners can grow with us through those relationships, which makes it easier for them. So as we gain scale, I think our value proposition to more sophisticated and larger customers continues to improve, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to grow our generics franchise in this way.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, should we assume further international deals now and drug retail and distribution are now part of the equation? And then just the other question, would be just -- with $8 billion going out the door, you cite some synergies, but how do you protect that investment from some of the macro pressures that made some of these international distribution models distasteful to you in the past?","John H. Hammergren","That's a good question. Now clearly, I think one of the things that also gave us confidence in our ability to deploy capital in this fashion was our track record of doing so in an intelligent and responsible way. And we have a very disciplined process in making acquisitions, and the financial parameters that James discussed in his remarks are the first hurdle we have to go through. It's not just accretion. In fact, accretion is the last thing we look at. We look at our discounted cash flow analysis, our ability to get a return and our ability to maintain our return on invested capital over time, albeit sometimes it takes a bit of a depression as we bring a big acquisition like this on. So those parameters are very important to us. We do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to deploy capital in Europe and in Latin America as an example. We think the expertise of Celesio brings in these markets will be extremely helpful to us as we deploy that capital. I mentioned their European pharmacy network activity, clearly, which is a source of opportunity for us as we build out Lloyds and continue to take that banner into a franchise kind of a model in other markets. So that is all an opportunity. But in the early phases of this, our objective will be to delever the company. We're going take on some significant debt here as we go forward, and I think it's important for us to, first, make sure that our financial condition and our balance sheet is in shape before we begin thinking about at least significant capital deployment in any additional markets.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, how do you feel comfortable, John, with the government's kind of dictating reimbursement in some of the markets now that you're going into? I mean, how do you protect yourself from cuts, either on dispensing fees or generic reimbursement?","John H. Hammergren","Well, that was the second part of your question. I think you said the European wholesalers have had some challenges. If you actually look at Celesio's history, many of its challenges were self inflicted related to deployment of capital. They have now sold DocMorris, which was a channel conflict for them. They made some other acquisitions that, frankly, that I think in retrospect probably didn't work as they had been -- they had anticipated. So I think we -- the first decision is to make share you don't make mistakes in those markets from a capital deployment perspective and you don't compete with your customers. And I'd say the second thing is we go into this with our eyes wide open. We only have the ability to help customers and supply chain when the supply chain is an opportunity for us to affect. And in some markets, as you pointed out, the choice of product may be made by governments or other health plans or payers that really takes that decision out of our control. And our synergies, as we've outlined them here, reflect the fact that some of these markets will not be available opportunities for us, at least in the early phases. So we don't think we're going to change healthcare financing in these markets. And we've been dealing with a market like Canada, which is very European-esque in its approach to drug reimbursement and the way prices are determined. And we've been able to grow nicely in a market like that because we come with a full and complete solution. And frankly, some of these payers, I think, will be encouraged by our approach to pharmaceutical use and how, in fact, it actually, if it's properly done, can reduce the cost of healthcare in those markets as opposed to being a target for continued, as you refer to it, cuts and slashes in reimbursement. But we're not going into this with a myopic view that somehow we're going to change the way the pharmaceuticals are purchased by governments around the globe.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, just thinking about co-op purchasing and thinking about generics, is this something like you'll set up now with your Celesio partner something similar to what we see with AB and Walgreens and then allow some of your larger retailers to buy generics on that way? Not so much disturbing them but actually a purchasing cooperative, is that something that you're thinking about as you move forward with this?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, we are always open to creative ways to bring value to our partners and our customers. And I think that what's nice about this transaction with Celesio is we get global scale immediately without having to deal with some of the challenges associated with the venture structure and some of the management issues that may come along with it. However, we do think that there are ways for us to take that scale and strategy and bring it to our customers in a way that will benefit them. I don't know that it necessarily has to take on a venture format, but clearly, we can find ways to make sure that our customers benefit along with us, both the supply customers, as well -- the manufacturing customers as well as the retail customers and hospital customers.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then think my follow-up question, I mean, clearly, great results again this quarter. On the core distribution side, can you talk about where you're taking market share to see the direct business up, growing 13% well above the market? Can just give us an idea of, again, where you're taking market share from today and how you see that going forward?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we've been heavily focused on working with our existing customers to get an ever-increasing share of their business. So a portion of that direct distribution business growth is actually coming out of our existing warehousing line or out of our customer base where they've been sourcing a portion of their product in a direct basis and are now increasingly using McKesson to assist them in their transactions in generics and in brand for that matter. So I think that our objective is to continue to grow with our customers. We are focused on expanding our margins through the services and the value add that we deliver, and that's been our priority.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And where would you say we are, though, in that process? You've been talking about this for a while. Are we still in the fairly early innings of that? Or do you think that we're in the latter part of pulling that incremental business into McKesson?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think it's an ongoing process. I think you won't find a year -- I don't -- I shouldn't give you a forecast, but I think this has been an unusual year. As you know, there have been fewer generic launches, so that helps our revenues grow in a marketplace where the generics aren't taking the price of the brand down so much. And I also would say that we had some significant transitions with customers this year where we had a favorable move in mix with those customers, from warehousing to direct purchases. And that probably -- that delta probably don't won't continue like it has this year. And of course, we had PSS in our business, which is also an increment in both revenue and in margin expansion as well as the overall year-on-year comparison.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just stepping over to the IT business for a second here, the revenue, a little bit light versus what we had expected but the margins, obviously, looking much better. But as you expand internationally and you have a lot of growth opportunities there, can you talk about the strategic value of holding on to this IT business? I mean, its contribution to total revenue and operating profit is slowly shrinking here. Maybe you can give us your thoughts around that, John.","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, we're very happy with the performance of our Technology Solutions business this year. It really marks the turnaround, I think, both strategically and financially for that business. We've done a great job, I believe, of organizing it in a way that will be effective going forward, and I think our customers have benefited from what we've been doing. Our responsibility as an executive team is to always review the portfolio of businesses that we manage, and as you have noted, this year, we have made a decision to exit some of the businesses that we believe didn't stand up to either the strategic value or the business performance value that we expect from these assets. So I wouldn't say that we're married to any strategy relative to what assets we have other than success. I think that our recent results in technology have been successful. So there are no plans for us to change the mix. However, our responsibility is to constantly come back and revisit that decision.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just sort of follow-up, James, I think if I heard you right, you're saying that you expect for the -- for fiscal '14 to be above your target 200 to 250 basis points for operating margin. Is that -- should we think about that as a sustainable level? And does that mean our long-term target changes? Or how should we think about that beyond fiscal '14?","James Beer","Well, for the Distribution Solutions segment, we're expecting the full year fiscal '14 operating margin to be above the midpoint of that 200- to 250-basis-point range. So I think that's important to clarify. And we'll update that as we go along in the coming years.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, just a couple of quick questions. I'm kind of curious to get your perspective on some of the differences between the European wholesale model and what you have domestically. And with that, I'm kind of curious, could you comment a little bit more on traditional generic versus brand economics given the regulated pricing environment? Is it structured similarly? Or how do -- can you give us some more color?","John H. Hammergren","Well, Glen, I think that the wholesale model in terms of the logistics operations are similar to ours. However, the delivery model in some of the markets is different. The frequency with which they deliver the stores, the frequency of the order pattern of the customers are slightly different. But essentially, wholesaling in Europe is wholesaling in our North American operations. We buy from the same manufacturers, both generic and brand. We have similar kinds of relationships, and there's a process by which we can improve the efficiency with our retail customers through the systems we deploy and the information we provide and the way we help those either owned or banner stores be more productive and more involved in the clinical care process. And I think, increasingly, what we're finding in the global markets, including the U.S., frankly, is that pharmacy is becoming more and more of a care provider beyond just the dispensing of medication. It is a lower-cost alternative than going to the emergency rooms or going to someplace else. You've seen the emergence of things like MinuteClinic, with CVS, et cetera, that have been quite successful. And I think types of models are also permeating the European landscape. Now clearly, the buying process of generics in the U.S. is fragmented. Some of it's wholesaling -- wholesalers that are purchasing the generics, and sometimes it's the large retailers that are purchasing the generics. And if you move into Europe, you probably have a similar model there. And in terms of the reimbursement in some of the markets, the wholesaler and the retailers are making the decision on the selection of the generic. And in other markets, other payers or governments are making the decision on selecting the generics. So I think there are nuancial [ph] changes or differences in the way that the markets work that have an implication on how you prepare yourself in the marketplace. But if you actually look under the covers of the various countries in which Celesio competes, the operating margin structure and the way they approach the market is very similar to what we do in our Canadian or our U.S. operations. So there's not a lot of dissimilarities. And when I talked about the synergies earlier from a supply chain perspective, those synergies are really crafted around models where McKesson has more of an influence over the relationship between, particularly the generic, a manufacture choice and the customer's ability to sell it through.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, maybe if I can just follow up on that, I mean, you commented on some of the regulatory issues that impact that European wholesaling business. But if you look at the recent brand-to-generic conversion, it kind of looks like those companies haven't gotten the same lift that sort of domestic players have had. And then if you read some of the regulatory filings from Celesio, they talk about incremental competition in discounting, and while you reap the benefits of an oligopoly here in the United States, it feels like there was more incremental pricing pressure over there. So could you comment on the competitive environment and how you think about the profit outlook for those businesses?","John H. Hammergren","Well, there are 2 different streams of thought there. Clearly, the penetration of generics in Europe is below that, that we experienced in the U.S. And therefore, there's a significant opportunity for us to expand the utilization of generics and therefore, improve the profitability of the operations as generics are more widely consumed. So we see that, clearly, as an opportunity. Once again, that's not really built into our synergy assumptions. The view we have relative to our ability to manage the generics selection process, et cetera, is really country by country. And we -- I think each one operates in a different way, and I think our analysis has been pretty thorough in terms of where we think the countries are going to manage generics in a way that works for the model that we've deployed. And on the competition front, if you actually look inside, I think what Celesio has said publicly, the competitive dynamic has been most difficult for them in Germany. I think the rest of the markets appear to be relatively stable, and the companies that are competing in those markets seem to be doing so in a rational basis. And clearly, we have our eyes wide open on the results that have been achieved over there as well. I think our going in position is that we have to manage this business carefully, that the Celesio management team has a good grip on what they're doing, and the country presidents have tremendous experience in their markets and understand those markets and are doing what they need to do to manage effectively.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just if you can help us provide some context along the supply chain synergies targets for the next 4 years, can you give us some sense as to what is the combined generic sourcing power for the 2 companies?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think that it's fair to say that we have been able to look carefully at the generic purchasing patterns and as I said earlier, look at it on a country-by-country basis. And we've compared what's going on with Celesio to what we've got with United States and Canada, and we believe there's a significant opportunity. The quantification of generics is one that is difficult to make on a comparative basis because everybody looks at it in a different way, what goes through distribution, what's controlled spend, what goes through retail, et cetera. So I think it's probably fair to say that those comparisons are not as relevant as really getting inside the business model, and that's really the magic on how we've been able to continue to grow our program, as evidenced in the results this quarter.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in the prepared remark, you mentioned the convergence between the segments and the globalization. So is Celesio's retail business core to your strategy?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, retail is core to our strategy, and retail for Celesio in the markets in which they own the stores has been a very successful strategy, and the Lloyds brand has performed quite well for them. In the markets where Celesio owns retail, other wholesalers own retail as well, and that dynamic has been in place for a long, long time. We do not plan to enter the retail space in the U.S. or Canada on a direct basis, and in the markets in Europe, most of them are regulated from a retail perspective where independence have a great deal of power in those markets and deliver most of the medications from a retail perspective. And Celesio has done a terrific job in those countries in building relationships with these independent pharmacies to allow them to continue to be very successful on both the financial and clinical dimensions in which they're working. And those partnerships and relationships with independent pharmacies remain critical to McKesson and Celesio going forward globally. And part of the value that we bring is the continued scale and influence that we have, as well as our operating expertise that is enhanced, I think, by the Lloyds experience that when independent retailers are looking for a partner, that Lloyds experience helps us help them manage their stores in a more complete way.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So congratulations on this deal. Boy, certainly nobody saw this coming. I mentioned that as kind of jokingly here. So I think you've done some detailed work on the generic synergies, and I guess, preliminarily, just trying to think about some of the flow here, do you see more of the potential McKesson U.S. generic procurement and that supply flowing to Europe? Or would more flow from the Celesio European generic procurement into the U.S? So which side right now may have the larger synergy potential? And also, do you actually even think about it that way?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think we probably don't think about it that way necessarily. As you think about the people we partner with in generics, they're global companies, and we source on a global basis. I think that the synergy number we provided you is a McKesson-Celesio combined synergy number. And I think that we haven't thought about necessarily giving you any data on a discrete market-by-market basis relative to where those generics would go. But we have -- we clearly believe that it's a global business, and our global relationships will benefit both our supply chain partners as well as our customers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Robert Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I -- most of mine have been covered at this point, and I think you -- John, you've loosely referred to my next question a few times, but I'll ask it more succinctly. I know you mentioned it was an opportunistic deal here, and maybe there weren't other options available to you. But something you could give more specific color on your thought process with an outright buy versus other options that have been rumored in the press, such as perhaps only buying the distribution piece or partnering with a large U.S. pharmacy on the deal either jointly or splitting it up. Was outright buy really the only thing you were looking to do? Or were there perhaps other options that you would have considered?","John H. Hammergren","Clearly, this transaction was speculated upon, has been for a long time. And you could even go back 10 years ago, the speculation existed. At some point, McKesson and perhaps others would take a more global perspective on distribution. I think our perspective is that the entire transaction made the most sense for us. The combined retail and wholesale operation that's principally operated in the U.K. for Celesio has worked extremely well, and we saw no reason to separating those 2 operations just because of a change in ownership. And I would say that we believe that the ability for McKesson to execute against the synergies is enhanced through a complete ownership model as opposed to some type of a venture or the additional complexity of trying to buy an asset with multiple companies involved and then changing the strategies of those companies after we acquire them to change the course that they were currently on. This is not an operational turnaround execution issue for Celesio and McKesson to deal with. If you actually think about the challenges that Celesio has had, it's principally a challenge with pricing in existing market and the acquisition and capital deployment strategies that they've been about fixing over the last 12 to 18 months. So I think adding additional operating complexity by trying to do it differently just didn't make any sense, and we're focused on executing going forward, and we think we can do so on a combined basis very well. I would end with saying that I do believe there are additional opportunities for us to work with others that will provide value, and we're certainly open to various models as we complete this transaction that will afford our customers and our supply chain partners with additional value.","I certainly want to thank the operator today, and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time. I'm certainly pleased with our strong second quarter performance, and I'm very excited about the future of the business and our acquisition of Celesio. I look forward to welcoming the management team and employees of Celesio and, together, creating a global platform to grow and support the success of our customers.","I'll now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events and for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On November 12, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release third quarter earnings late in January.

Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thank you, Erin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a good start to fiscal 2013 with total company revenues of $30.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.55. We continue to expect to achieve our adjusted earnings guidance of $7.05 to $7.35 for fiscal 2013. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. On June 28, the Supreme Court affirmed that the Affordable Care Act will proceed much as it was originally enacted by Congress. The act will drive many changes in health care in the coming years. But through all of this change, the issues of quality, access and cost will continue to remain at the center of all health care discussions. System-changing reform is taking place throughout health care as payers, providers, manufacturers, pharmacies prepare for the expansion in coverage under the Affordable Care Act.","As patient volumes increase, our customers will need to respond with increased efficiency. Our customers will need to continue to reduce cost and improve the quality of patient care through the use of information technology. They will be judged by adherence to evidence-based protocols and improved outcomes. And they will be experimenting with new approaches to reimbursement models, like patient-centered medical home and accountable care.","As a leader in health care services and information technology, McKesson has a great opportunity to help our customers meet these goals of reducing costs and promoting value across the health care system. Before I turn to the first quarter results for Distribution Solutions, I'll provide an update on our average wholesale price litigation.","As a reminder, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed a settlement of local public entity claims. Most recently, we finalized a settlement of the Federal share of Medicaid claims related to AWP during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Today, we reached final agreement with the Coalition of State Attorneys General to resolve the majority of state Medicaid claims related to AWP. That leaves a few outstanding state cases that we plan to vigorously defend. This settlement represents another important step in bringing resolution to claims related to AWP.","Now let me turn back to our operations. Distribution Solutions started the year with solid revenue and operating profit growth. Although it's still very early in our fiscal year, we remain confident in our full-year expectations. As I highlighted in our initial guidance on April 30, fiscal 2013 represents a robust year for all generic launches. McKesson is well-positioned with our strong manufacturer relationships and customer-focused proprietary programs to continue to provide value across our extensive generic offering. We also expect that our broad range of value-added services for branded manufacturers should contribute to steady levels of compensation. We continue to renew and expand our customer footprint in our distribution and wholesale business by delivering unique value to our customers. Like all customers, they are focused on competitive prices and great service. However, in today's health care environment, that alone is not sufficient. Today, our customers have to be more productive, deliver error-free and high-quality care, and increasingly connect to others involved in the financial and care processes, including the patient. As you know, we have a large technology business that is only part of our value proposition as a company. Perhaps, more important today is our ability to use technology in combination with the blocking and tackling of distribution to help all of our customers with their business, clinical and connectivity challenges.","Sure, all of our markets are competitive, but no more so than before. The key to our continued success is adding innovation to the equation, which in turn brings value to our customers. That value is being added today with customers from the smallest physician office to the largest retailers in the world. For example, last month our U.S. Pharmaceutical business brought together thousands of independent pharmacy owners and pharmacists to our annual trade show to learn about the industry's latest trends impacting their business. During the event, we underscored McKesson's commitment to helping independent pharmacies achieve better results and better patient health.","At the conference we highlighted solutions that helped independent pharmacists enhance patient loyalty and outcomes and broaden the range of services they provide. Solutions like McKesson's sponsored clinical services network, which enables independent pharmacists to play a greater role in providing patient care and services, in addition to growing their revenues. Sponsored clinical services is a network of 13,000 community pharmacies delivering a suite of patient-centered programs, including education, support and behavioral coaching. The network streamlines the relationship between pharmacies, manufacturers and payer-sponsored programs focused on increasing adherence and improving patient care. Participating pharmacies benefit from the opportunity to increase customer loyalty, earn service fees and build their relationships with patients as a partner in their health care.","We also demonstrated new social, web and mobile technologies to help our customers connect with their patients and with health care peers in entirely new ways. A significant number of attendees were Heath Mart pharmacy owners and pharmacists. With nearly 3,000 stores across the country, Health Mart has become the franchise model of choice for independent pharmacy owners looking to complement their local identity with a national brand.","Health Mart continues to invest in new solutions to help these stores grow their business, including private label over-the-counter health care products and new consumer-facing web and mobile platforms.","In our Canadian Distribution business, we performed as we expected in the first quarter. We did have 4 fewer sales days in the quarter compared to prior year. So as a result, revenues were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The team continues to do a tremendous job of integrating the recent acquisition of Katz, and I'm pleased to see the early positive results from these efforts.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. Revenues were up 9% for the quarter. We've enjoyed good organic growth and have gained new primary care and extended care customers in addition. We have a great position in these markets. We offer a compelling value proposition to our customers through the services and technologies that we provide. As physicians move to practices in larger groups, which can be affiliated with or owned by hospitals or integrated delivery networks, McKesson participates in this growth by offering products and technology that service the unique needs of these larger customer markets. And as I mentioned in my opening comments on the distribution segment, it is often our technology that differentiates McKesson in our conversations with customers. For example, our Medical-Surgical business offers technology that helps us customers better track and manage their inventory, saving them time and money. Individual group practice and affiliated physicians also benefit from our revenue management solutions business, which is actually part of our Technology Solutions segment. McKesson Revenue Management Solutions offers leading outsourced financial and billing solutions, helping our physician customers focus their time on providing quality patient care.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. We are well positioned with our successful proprietary generics program, and we are benefiting from a period of significant generic product introduction. Our recent acquisitions in this segment, US Oncology and the Katz acquisition, are both performing well and adding the important strategic capabilities and scale to better serve our customers. And our Medical-Surgical business continues to win with customers through our combination of great service and great technology. We're off to a solid start, and we are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Our performance across the segment at this early point in the year is in line with our expectations. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter and adjusted operating margins were roughly 13%. We continue to make steady progress across all of our technology businesses. We remain committed to ensuring our customers' success in supporting them on their journey to reaching the important Meaningful Use milestones. The domestic health care services industry is in a period of time where the focus is on automating health care.","Taking a step back, all of the time, money and energy spent converting the old paper-based health care data into electronic records will only work if that data can be used by our customers to see trends and make changes in care and affect those trends.","By connecting financial information and clinical information, our customers can use their data to not only improve their operations but improve patient outcomes. Across all 3 of our technology businesses, you've heard us talk about the importance of providing business intelligence capability. So I wanted to take a moment to give you a little more insight into what we are doing for our customers.","In our Provider Technologies business, we've analytic solutions in more than 1,000 facilities including core McKesson customers and many customers who operate on other core systems. Our analytic solutions enable customers to gather data from across their organizations and present that data to medical staff in a meaningful way to improve patient and business outcomes. This can be done at a high level or at a very detailed level with the common goal of optimizing interaction with and care for the patient.","Using our McKesson Enterprise Intelligence Solutions, our customers have achieved significant results. For example, one of our customers use McKesson technology, along with internal process changes, to significantly reduce ventilator-acquired pneumonia in its facilities. They did this by leveraging visual alerts consistent with their protocols for complex care to help caregivers deliver the right care at the right time. Another product recently launched by RelayHealth is RelayAnalytics Pulse. It enables hospitals and health systems to monitor their own key performance metrics and compare their financial health with other organizations and peers. With our other analytic solutions, there is a long lag time between data aggregation and the delivery to the end-user. Some competitive solutions provide benchmarking data that is as much as a year old. RelayAnalytics Pulse provides daily data updates, which is a unique and compelling capability.","In our Health Solutions business, actionable business intelligence is core to the underpinning of our payer-focused technology products and services. One example is our claims analysis service, which is part of our broader Total Payment Solution. Customers using McKesson's Total Payment Solution can successfully adjudicate claims under an increasingly complex mix of current and emerging value-based reimbursement methodologies. One of the powerful features of this solution is the embedded claims analysis service, which helps our customers identify opportunities where they can realize additional medical and administrative savings by enhancing their claims payout automation processes.","Taking this back to my opening comments on the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act. Our analytic solutions are one of the many ways we are focused on helping our customers achieve sustainable cost reduction, provide timely insight to their operations and promote value within the health care system. This is becoming a top-of-mind issue for all of our customers.","In summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which represent a good start to fiscal 2013. In addition to our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations between $2 billion and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, McKesson delivered solid first quarter results and is off to a good start for the new fiscal year.","Let me begin by briefly mentioning 2 items that while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically, a $16 million AWP litigation charge and the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain. First, as John highlighted in his remarks, we continue to work through the remaining AWP claims. As a result of the progress made towards resolving these remaining claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $16 million. This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.04 per diluted share.","Second, as I discussed on our April 30 earnings call, in the first quarter we completed a business combination in which we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building. The way the accounting rules in this area work, this creates a pretax acquisition-related gain of approximately $81 million. Similar to how we treat other acquisition-related items, this transaction has been excluded from our adjusted earnings results.","My remaining comments today will focus on our $1.55 adjusted earnings per share, which as you'll recall excludes 3 types of items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will all be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release.","Let me now turn to our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues of $30.8 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing nicely to this result. On this 3% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $1.6 billion. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1 billion were up 5% for the quarter, roughly in line with the overall growth of the business. Other income was flat for the quarter at $8 million. Interest expense declined $8 million versus the prior year to $56 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012.","Moving now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 28% benefited from $17 million of net favorable discrete tax items. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in June, the $17 million of net favorable discrete items did come earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. And as a result, this pure timing shift from later in the fiscal year added roughly $0.06 to $0.07 relative to what we originally expected for our first quarter performance.","Looking to the full year, however, we are still tracking to the 31% adjusted tax rate that we included in our original guidance assumptions.","Adjusted net income for the quarter was $372 million, up 15% from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, an increase of 22% compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.27.","To wrap up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 6% year-over-year to 240 million. This year-over-year decline is primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which include more than $3.9 billion of share repurchase since Q1 of fiscal 2011. This is a testament to the strength of our cash flows and balance sheet, particularly since over the same time period, we also spent over $3 billion on acquisitions, including US Oncology and the Katz acquisition.","Turning back to share count. For fiscal 2013, we continued to expect our full-year average diluted share count will come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares.","Let's now move on to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 2% for the quarter to $21.3 billion. As always, there are some moving pieces here. We had some customer wins and losses, which were roughly offset. We benefited from an increase in volume with certain existing customers. And the branded price increase environment roughly offset the loss in brand revenues from new generic launches. Our warehouse revenues increased 9% year-over-year, primarily benefiting from expanded volumes with existing customers. For the full year, we continue to expect unusually strong growth in our warehouse line.","Moving on to Canada. On a reported basis, revenues were down 8% for the quarter. There are really 2 main drivers of this result: the impact of having 4 fewer sales days in the quarter this year; and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. When you adjust for both of these items, Canadian revenues grew 2% for the quarter. We are pleased to see this growth in our Canadian revenues given the government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs that we have been talking about for some time. Staying on Canada for one more minute, I do want to remind you that our Katz acquisition does not have a material impact on revenues as we were already providing distribution services to the Katz stores. The acquisition does, however, favorably impact our adjusted gross profit, and it also added 1 to 2 percentage points to our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense growth this quarter.","Turning now to Medical-Surgical. Revenues were up a strong 9% for the quarter to $795 million, driven by market growth and new customers. Adjusted gross profit for the segment increased 8% for the quarter to $1.2 billion on the 3% revenue growth. Overall, we are pleased with this result. We did, of course, have tremendous growth in our oral generic profits this quarter. But this was somewhat offset due to the year-over-year decline in specialty generics and also due to the mix impact of the strong warehouse revenue growth we posted. Remember that the impact on our earnings of higher warehouse revenues is quite modest, as we earn lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues.","Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expenses were up 7% for the quarter, primarily driven by the Katz acquisition and some charges we recorded this quarter related to the optimization of our Canadian network. When you exclude these 2 items, our adjusted operating expense growth was closer to 3% to 4% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 185 basis points, an improvement of 9 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarter variability in this segment we always focus, as you know, on full-year margins. In this context, for full year fiscal 2013, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the mid- to high-single-digit basis points compared to our full year fiscal 2012 adjusted operating margin rate of 210 basis points. In summary, we are pleased with the solid first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were up 4% for the quarter to $838 million, with all businesses in the segment contributing to this growth. Adjusted gross profit for this segment increased 1% to $388 million. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending was $113 million compared to $105 million in the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized just 6% versus 10% a year ago. Adjusted operating expense increased 6% in the quarter to $280 million, primarily driven by growth in the business and the increase in net R&D spending.","Our Technology Solutions adjusted operating profit was down 8% versus a year ago to $109 million. And our adjusted operating margin was 13.01% compared to 14.84% a year ago. Overall, these results were in line with our expectations. As first mentioned on our April 30 earnings call, we continue to expect results in this segment to be weighted towards the back half of this fiscal year. And with respect to the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens or 14% to 16%.","Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. As you've heard me say before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of week marks the close of any given quarter. So this quarter our receivables were $9.6 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.4 billion, with our days sales outstanding decreasing to 24 days from 25 days last year. Compared to a year ago, inventories increased 6% to $10 billion, and our payables increased 4% to $15.2 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory increasing by 1 day to 31 days, with our day sales in payables also increasing by 1 day to 47 days. In the quarter, we used $552 million in operating cash flow. There were 2 primary drivers of this result, which is a little unusual. First to remind you, in the quarter we made $273 million of payments on previously accrued AWP liabilities. Second, this quarter was impacted by some inventory purchasing in payable patterns that should reverse out in the September quarter. So overall for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operations will be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment.","Overall, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 33.2% for the quarter, well within our target range of 30% to 40%. Internal capital spending was $84 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $425 million and $475 million.","Now I'll turn to our outlook. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. And as John mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our guidance on adjusted earnings of $7.05 to $7.35. One other point about our fiscal 2013 outlook, we expect $0.54 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we're now assuming $0.04 for litigation reserve adjustments. In addition, as a result of the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain, we now expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.19. Thanks.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to ask a couple of quick questions on the out margin within your Distribution Solutions segment. John, what I was wondering about, given some of the high-profile deals in the marketplace, if you're seeing that have any impact on pricing, in particular your sell side margins as it relates to new business. And secondarily, I was curious if you're seeing anything new with respect to branded price inflation or generic pricing that maybe makes you more or less confident in the margin outlook.","John H. Hammergren","Well, let me start at end of that conversation and work my way back the other way. On the branded and generic pricing, our trends are basically in line with what our expectations were as we came out with our plans for the year. Albeit a couple of big launches early in this quarter probably were a little more competitive than we had expected. But in the mix of things, we're feeling pretty good about where branded and generic price trends seem to be headed. But obviously it's still early in the year. As it relates to pricing and margins delivered through our customer relationships, as you know we focus on long-term value with our long-term customers. And we continue, as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, to sell solutions and technology to our customers in combination with distribution that helps to differentiate what we do every day. I think that's obvious in our margin structure that we not only do a great job of delivering day-to-day service in a very productive way and really low-cost, but we also, I think, are afforded an opportunity to sell solutions to our customers that enhance their performance and deliver sustainable value that may take the focus more on value delivered rather than price for the service. And we think that's the way customers should make decisions, and we try to stay out of price-oriented conversations.","And one last comment on market pricing. As you know, we spend most of our time focused on our existing customers, so I can't tell you I have a big experience set with the new customer comment that you made, because we don't bring on a lot of new customers. We've been focused heavily on our existing business and making sure those renewals are happening the way they always have historically.","Operator","We will hear our next question from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I guess I'd like to -- my question really centers on some of the comments you made at your Analyst Day. And I just want to tie that in with some of your comments today. It seems like the theme certainly of the Analyst Day was around the balance of the business, the mix of business that's allowing you great results over a longer period of time and obviously very solid results. Today, you continue that trend. In addition to that, though, you've got an outlook that I think, John, you highlighted, is going to be subject to a lot of change with health care reform, in an environment with a greater focus in the customer environment around generics and the value proposition there.","My question is really, as you think about this year, you've gotten customer relationships that are up for renewal toward the end of the year. You've had a really good record of renewing those. You also have another, I guess, a grocery customer who said they may be up for sale. So how do you balance that? And, I guess, specifically my question is, in an environment where everybody is chasing after generic dollars, what are you doing specifically in this environment to differentiate yourselves, so that the conversation moves away from just pricing and continues to drive toward what you define as a differentiated value proposition?","John H. Hammergren","I think the pressure that our customers are feeling this year is probably not that much different than the pressures they've felt in the past. I think we've always had a competitive environment. And certainly, our customers have always been afforded the opportunity to not only buy from other wholesalers, but they have been afforded the opportunity to buy generics from various channels, including direct. And our challenge over the years has been to build a portfolio of capabilities both in terms of the price of the product that we provide, but also in terms of the service that we can provide, in particular, to our customers on generics that they may not be able to deliver on their own or in some other model. Obviously, there's tremendous operational efficiency to place one order at night, and the next day receive all of your product to all of your stores from McKesson and not have to fragment those orders through your own internal capabilities, through some kind of an internal direct sourcing capability, or to fragment it through other smaller companies that are out there trying to sell generics as a sole offering. And our ability to focus our customers on the total value that we deliver has to remain key and our ability to remain disciplined around the price that we deliver to the marketplace, charging for the value that we deliver not chasing commodity price-oriented deals and focusing on those customers that really appreciate what we do. I think if we didn't have confidence that we could continue to expand our margins in spite of some of these pressures that continue, we wouldn't have guided this year to the margin expansion that we've already guided to. And clearly we are already above the market and believe that we can continue to be relative to our peers in terms of operating margin because of the mix of our business, because of the value that we sell, because of the discipline in our selling process, and our focus on those -- continued evolution of that strategy. Having said all of that, clearly things can change. Our view is that nothing's changed thus far, and things remain competitive but stable, but it's always one of those deals that you have to pay attention to what's going on in the market and stay focused. But I think we remain optimistic, Larry. Nothing's really changed from our Analyst Meeting.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, okay. And just a follow-up maybe, Jeff. I think you did a good job of calling out the tax good guy, I guess, at the Analyst Meeting which obviously you saw. And the message is the rest of the year is going to sort of accrue [ph]. Back to that, as you say, 31%. So notwithstanding the fact you usually don't think about guiding the quarters or the puts and takes, now that you've gotten through the first quarter, is there anything of note that would lead you to think about any different progression of earnings versus last year then for the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, the short answer, Larry, is really no. This was the one big group of tax planning initiatives that we thought we'd get to this year and it came a little earlier. The rest of the tax rate will be similar, and boy, our quarterly results the rest of the year will be subject to all the same kind of variability we always have, including a back-half loaded Technology Solutions, a quarter of the usual strong March quarter in Distribution Solutions just due to the structure of our agreements with many brand manufacturers. But I think really none of that is particularly different from we were on April 30.","Operator","We'll hear our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on a comment, John, that you made around the strong warehouse sales and the fact that you expect them to continue. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from a customer perspective around warehouse sales? And then secondly, the inventory purchases -- is that tied to the increase in warehouse sales? Or are you seeing opportunities from an inventory appreciation perspective?","John H. Hammergren","It's really not inventory, Lisa, as much as existing customers who are gaining some share, and I think a continued view that our warehousing operations provide benefit to those customers and synergy that they otherwise wouldn't obtain on their own. And as you know, some of our larger customers have experienced some share shift this year as a result of contracts that they may have won that will flow through that or market share changes that have taken place in the chains that have been very visible in the industry. So other than that, there really hasn't been any significant action. And I don't know, Jeff, you might have something you would want to add there.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, I'll just make 2 points. On warehouse sales, I'd just remind you that, that's really not a standalone product. It's a combination that's very valuable to certain of our very largest customers who also do lots of direct store business with us. And we think of those relationships as an overall economic relationship. On the cash issue, I -- maybe I managed to confuse people. So the day of the week that the quarter ended and just the way we happened to have some of our inventory purchases fall, drove a bunch of cash into the September quarter that in past years would have fallen into the June quarter. It had absolutely nothing to do actually with the growth in warehouse sales from one of our larger customers and certainly wasn't tied to -- if you go back a few years with anything going on, on the buy side. It's really just timing of when things got stocked up.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I guess just as one other follow-up would just be around med-surg. You talked about 9% growth in the quarter, which was very good growth. Can you just talk about what you're seeing as far as underlying growth for that business segment versus what it sounds like some competitive wins in the segment in the quarter?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, I think that the market growth rates, Lisa, are probably in the 3% to 4% range. You might recall that we have a strong position in physician office. We have a strong position in long-term care. And we have a strong position in home health care and sort of the miscellaneous side of things. And all 3 of those segments had -- or pieces of the business had very strong growth and above-market growth. I think our combination of service and the technology offering that I mentioned earlier that has really changed the face of just delivering product to delivering more complete solutions has made a difference. And the migration of physicians out of small practices into more aggregated practices -- we're seeing that phenomenon both at US Oncology, our revenue cycle management business, and our med-surg business, where this aggregation actually plays to our strengths. Because these customers are more sophisticated, they're more technologically oriented, and they appreciate the value that we deliver. They're not just price oriented. They're more value focused and we're able to beat the competition, who primarily have been focused on moving boxes from point a to point b at a low price. And so I think that this larger value proposition is helping us win in med-surg.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bob Willoughby from Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You guys came in well under my D&A assumption for the year. I was just kind of curious, is this in the ballpark of a run rate to use going forward? And can you comment on just the other income line? There was a nice gain there, but what's the run rate for the year on that line item?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, so on the D&A -- do you mean overall D&A, Bob, or are you talking about the acquisition-related amortization?","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just what your target for the year would be.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, on the acquisition-related amortization -- just pulling it out here, for the full year, we think it will be about $0.54 based on all the acquisitions that have been completed to date. If you are looking at broader depreciation and amortization, there's not really anything going on unusual from quarter-to-quarter. So you should really be able to take that number and just annualize it.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With the Katz deal, I was surprised it didn't rise, though, in the first quarter.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, remember we've been an acquisitive company for many, many years. And so when you think about acquisition-related amortization, some of it starts to drop off over time. And so I might remind you, for example, we bought Per-Se back in 2007 or thereabouts, and so some of those charges are starting to roll off.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just the other income. There's some variability there. What's a good run rate?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","The other income is going to vary by a little bit each quarter, but there's nothing particularly unusual this quarter. And so I would still take a mixture of look at last year's number, look at this quarter's number and annualize it and pick something in the middle, and that's going to get you pretty close.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci from Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","John, I'm not sure if there's an easy way to answer this first question, but certainly I think you talked about your, sort of, your total value proposition as one way to sort of combat the competitive pressures out there and help your customers become more efficient over time. Is there any measure that you can point to in terms of maybe multiple services per customer or something like that, that we can actually see how you're gaining from that standpoint and having that broader array of offerings?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think if you look at our track record over the last decade, we've been able to show evidence of our ability to not only grow in line with the marketplace in almost all of our businesses or above in the businesses where there's still opportunities like med-surg, for example. And I think that the fact that our margins have expanded at a nice rate show that there's a value orientation to what we're doing. And our customers aren't only focused on price, and we're selling that value. And you've heard us talk about our various offerings on calls like this and our analyst meetings and with customers if you go to various events that we might be having. And I think a good example would be our ability to, for independent pharmacies, to tie our own software systems for point-of-sale and the automation of the pharmacy dispensing process behind the counter with our RelayHealth pharmacy network to help them adjudicate their claims and optimize their performance along with the automation equipment behind the counter to help them reduce labor and improve productivity and then wrap that in the Health Mart franchise. There are very few -- probably not any companies in the industry that can combine wholesaling with all of that capability under one umbrella in a more integrated way.","And surely our, for example, Relay would have share in our competitors' customers from a distribution perspective. But when we tie it into our own customer base, our customers realize the value that they otherwise wouldn't achieve, because of the integration with the systems we're able to provide.  So as a simple example, and clearly internally as we manage our book of businesses, we look at the overlap between hospital and distribution and pharmaceuticals with the physician office distribution of medical supplies in those same integrated networks with the IT footprint we have installed and the robotic systems we have in place and the cabinets we have on the floor. So you'll recall that 10 years ago, other companies were pursuing this more integrated approach. And I think that today, we're really the only ones that have got the technology footprint to pull it off. And I think it's been successful for us. Now clearly that success, Tom, wouldn't happen if we couldn't get the price right and the service right. That earns us the privilege to talk about these other things.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Sure, okay. Fair enough. That's good. And then you touched on the competitive landscape. I think a lot of those comments were sort of more focused on the traditional oral solids side of the business. Is there -- how would you characterize the landscape at this stage of the game in the specialty side? Obviously some peers maybe trying to build that business. Others have been in it, and are pretty big and maybe defending some turf. So is there anything unusual or new going on there?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think the biggest change we've seen in the specialty side of the business is the continued interest that physicians have to reach out and get help from someone who's capable of providing that help. And so standalone community oncologists, as an example, are looking for opportunities to automate, opportunities to buy better, opportunities to improve their ability to attract and retain talent and manage their offices, attract patients, adopt best-demonstrated protocols, a whole myriad of things that have caused them to have an increased interest in networking with each other. And clearly our acquisition of US Oncology not only provided us with significant scale, but gave us some capabilities, frankly, that are untouched in the industry in terms of our ability to have an intimate relationship with the physician, allowing them to get back to clinical care, while we take over some of the administrative tasks. Now clearly some of them may choose to sell out to a hospital and some may choose to move into a group that's not affiliated with US Oncology. But I think the days of independent physicians in probably all of our markets are beginning to wane, and the aggregation of physicians plays well to the strategy that McKesson has been laying out for the last decade, and I think we'll benefit from that. But as it relates to competitive pressures in these markets, I think it's fair to say that distribution has always been competitive. And it's particularly competitive if you find it difficult to differentiate your service. So we have been attempting to train our sales force to sell on value. We try to incent them to maintain these relationships and renew them over time. We try not to chase price-oriented-only buyers because it ends up as a futile exercise anyway. And I think we have been successful at that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It just looks like you guys you ended the quarter here with about $2 billion in cash. So just looking at an update on potentially implementing a more meaningful buyback in this fiscal year. Or are there maybe specifically areas that you guys are evaluating right now on the M&A front? Just looking for an update around capital deployment.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, a couple of things. I'd remind you that, yes, we ended with $2 billion of cash. And while we don't call out the offshore cash each quarter, back in March, it was about $1.4 billion. So a good chunk of that cash is offshore. Certainly, we build into our plan each year some amount of share repurchase. We don't call that out publicly. And, frankly, we manage a little bit based on what the acquisition environment offers us, how the year is going relative to the overall targets we've set, et cetera. We have, as a reminder, about $1 billion in outstanding authorization right now from our board. On acquisitions, I don't think anything has changed. So as usual, we see a range of alternatives and opportunities across almost all of our businesses in both segments, where there are companies out there that we think we could uniquely create some value with. But, boy, it's tough to predict when any of those companies are either available for sale or, much more importantly, available for sale at prices that make any sense for our shareholders.","John H. Hammergren","Sure, it's also fair to say there's lots of volatility in those valuations as you look at the quarters tick by. So I think patience has been one of our virtues as well.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Just to confirm then around the guidance obviously reaffirm the EPS range. I assume that the full year diluted share count that you laid out is intact then?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Correct. In fact, I specifically pointed out that we are sticking with our 239 million share outstanding for the year assumption.","John H. Hammergren","Built into that guidance.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Built into the guidance, correct.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And just one if I could sneak in on the Technology Solutions segment. It looks like you're a little bit shy of the long-term target. I know you said today that you expect to be in that low teens range. Just curious if there was anything specific in the quarter that weighted below that average or maybe what you guys expect over the next 3 quarters that should get it back into that range?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, this is really mechanically as simple as we told you back in April 30. This year would be unusually back-end loaded just due to some product GAs that we have in the back half of the year that will hold up wherever I can tell they happen later in the year. And so actually the quarter came in very much as we had expected.","Operator","We'll move to our next question, which will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One follow-up question and -- actually, 2 questions. So following up on US Oncology, we've heard earlier today some talk about oncology practices consolidating and gaining purchasing power. John, based on your earlier comments on the call, it sounds like McKesson is in a very good position to be a share taker. So can you take a little bit about how fast is the US Oncology physician base growing?","John H. Hammergren","Well, Ricky, I think what I should have said or meant to say is we're optimistic that our solution set is attractive to physicians. And whether they're existing physicians of ours that are aggregating together or whether they're physicians that don't use any of our services that are aggregating together, will be seen over time. I think our goal is not to gain share for share's sake. Our goal is to grow our business in a profitable way with customers that appreciate the value that we deliver. And we don't plan to compete in a way that doesn't take a holistic view, I guess, of what we have to deliver. And the customers that are interested in a US Oncology relationship with us are the more sophisticated customers that frankly have moved beyond their evaluation from simple distribution services to something much more significant. And so those are the customers that are usually open to that dialogue. I think that we will continue to see progress. Health care is a slow-moving world, and I don't think you're going to see sea changes, but I think, directionally, our view is that we're positively positioned.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on your warehouse sales. Do you expect any impact to warehouse sales in the second half now that Walgreens and Express reached an agreement? Is the potential reversal in some of the share gains that we've seen earlier in the year?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we're a little distant from this, Ricky, in that these are questions our customers are probably better suited to answer. From a distance, I would say that there are probably some customers who will move back to their incumbent relationships with Walgreens. But there are probably some customers that have moved away from Walgreens, and they have found another store that is as convenient as where they were buying before. So I really don't feel I'm well-positioned to talk much about the share move. I would say that relative to our warehouse view, I don't think you'll see any material change to our warehouse sales as a result of anything that's going on in the industry.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next caller, which comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Generic, I was curious if we could get the impact on revenue in the quarter.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Do you mean, Eric, in terms of generic revenue growth?","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, I'd like to get the -- both actually, revenue growth for generics, if you will, and then also the impact on branded conversions.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","So for us, given our mix of customers and drugs, the interesting thing is if you look at the revenue decline due to branded drugs losing patent protection, it almost completely matched and was offset by the growth in generic revenues due to all the generic launches. So they were almost identical in size.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up or the other quick question is, at the end of your prepared remarks, Jeff, you said something about $0.19 being additive to the number this year. I think I heard that, but the phone cut out, so I was just hoping you could refresh me on that.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, so in the -- we have the unusual accounting around our acquisition of the remaining 50% of the headquarters building we've been in since the 1960s. And so that drives an $81 million gain. We're pulling it out of our adjusted earnings because it's acquisition related. And so that gain netted against  a couple of cents of acquisition expenses means that you're going to -- as you do a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP, you've got a $0.19 good guy that you add to the non-GAAP to get to the GAAP.","Operator","We will hear next from George Hill with Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jeff, you guys are doing well in the distribution part and the real estate investment part it seems. I'm going to ask a quick question though. Two follow-ups from the health care IT business. Maybe, John, could you give us an update on how the clinical conversions are going from the Horizon business to the Paragon business? And then maybe this one's a little weegee. Within the RelayHealth business, as we're starting to see e-prescribing come up the curve and utilization get pretty high, how should we think about the growth in Relay profitability going forward?","John H. Hammergren","The clinical conversions -- when we talked about our Horizon to Paragon strategy, we talked about the fact that we believe it is a viable solution for our customers, and that over time they need to evaluate that as an alternative because of its more tightly integrated infrastructure and its lower cost of operations. It also has some build out required to fully function in the way that all of our Horizon customers would require. So we've seen many of our Horizon base evaluate the products. We've seen some of that base already contract to move to Paragon, and some already have moved because of whatever remaining development is necessary and Paragon was not of import to those customers. Others have said, you know what, we're going to go, but we want you to build out another module or we're going to go after we get our Meaningful Use dollars settled and we have a bit of breather. And others frankly will probably wait until they have their Meaningful Use 2 or Meaningful Use 3 situation well in hand before they make that migration.","So I think we've made good progress. I frankly am -- continue to be pleased with the reception our customer base has given to the Paragon solution. And frankly, taking it up a level, I think they're quite interested in the larger messages that McKesson has been delivering around our payer business and the need for the payer and provider solutions to come together, and also for our connectivity business. And I think the RelayHealth question is a good one. We are really pleased with our position in RelayHealth. I have to admit that the e-prescribing portion of the market's transition is not a particular profit driver for us. We're in that transaction both in our electronic medical record businesses as well as in Relay. But that's not really where the opportunity lies. The opportunity lies in the continued build out of our financial systems. As you know, we process well over $1 trillion in financial claims over our networks. Our Pharmacy Systems, which not only adjudicate pharmacy claims, but also helped us deliver more value to our customers through things like E-Voucher, where the manufacturers and the retailers work on behalf of the patient to provide better care and other offerings that RelayHealth is building out. Not the least of which is our new clinical information network or health information exchange. So I think we're pleased with our position on Relay. Electronic prescribing is a piece of it, but not the central driver financially.","Operator","We'll hear next from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So this was somewhat addressed in a previous question. But in the health care IT we obviously have seen some choppy results from a few of your competitors. And I guess my question is maybe just to quickly remind us of a couple of drivers of the acceleration in the tech solutions profit growth you expect in the back half of the year. I'm just trying to revisit your own level of visibility on your business plan for FY '13 for tech solution in light of potentially changing market conditions. So are you sort of worried about this? Do you feel you can achieve your targets kind of regardless of market conditions? Just trying to get a general sense for that.","John H. Hammergren","I have to admit that I'm -- I would think there would be pretty good visibility in tech buying at this point. And if it's a surprise to anyone that clinical buying is beginning to wane, they must not be deep in the industry. We believe that our customers have largely made their clinical decisions. And what's great about McKesson's technology platform is we're actually in many businesses, as you're aware. We have 3 major lines of business there: our Relay connectivity business, our Payer businesses and clearly our Provider Technology business. But even inside our Provider Technology, in my prepared remarks I talked about over 1,000 customers installed in our analytics products. You know that we have a market-leading Medical Imaging business and some of our other lines that aren't just clinical transaction processing businesses for hospitals. And so I think that we see the clinical buying beginning to wane, has waned. We're in the implementation phase now. Actually if you look at our results under the cover, you actually will see that our hospital buyers are beginning to come back to purchasing other solutions beyond clinicals. And I think those companies that don't have a portfolio beyond clinicals are probably feeling the effect of a pipeline that is probably headed in a different direction. We are pleased with our performance. We think we have visibility to it through the rest of this fiscal year, and we believe that business will perform in line with our expectations.","I think we've run out of time. I want to thank you, Anthony, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. I'm certainly pleased with our first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for all of us. I will now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thanks, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On September 6, we will present at the Baird Health Care Conference in New York. On September 10, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Conference, also in New York. On November 15, we'll present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix. We will release our second quarter earnings results in late October. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","Again, we thank you for joining today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, our recently-appointed President and Chief Operating Officer; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, with Brian making some introductory comments. And then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 AM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today.","Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.60. And we are narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share from the previous $13.00 to $13.80 per diluted share. I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our board of directors and leadership team. Our board of directors welcomed Dominic Caruso as a new Independent Director in September.","As the former Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson, Dominic brings with him significant financial and healthcare experience, which further strengthens the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have on our board. Also, I'd like to welcome Brian Tyler to this call, following his appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer reporting directly to me. Many of you are familiar with Brian, as he has regularly presented at previous Investor Day events in Boston and has led nearly all of our businesses during his 21-year tenure at McKesson.","I'll now ask Brian to talk about his vision around leading our global operations. Brian?","Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Clearly, there's a lot of work ongoing and work to be done. We have an impressive range of capabilities to build upon, combined with a great track record of execution. Having led corporate strategy and business development in many of our business units, I'm very energized about leading our operations as well as our strategic growth initiatives. We have faced and overcome many challenges during my time at McKesson. I continue to be encouraged by this company's resilience, its ability to navigate evolving market conditions and our strategic focus to improve long-term performance.","Our enterprise-wide multi-year growth strategy, including priority areas that focus on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy, all supported by data analytics, are promising areas of innovation. And importantly, we already have strong foundational businesses from which to build upon. The anticipated growth in conjunction with streamlined and aligned operations is strategically and financially attractive.","This focus positions us well for the changing landscape of healthcare. It allows us to leverage the strengths we've built in our world-class distribution platforms and services businesses, and we see substantial savings opportunities through the improved spend management, centralization of support functions and expanded outsourcing arrangements. Britt will discuss these operating model initiatives in more detail shortly.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to you, John.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, Brian, and welcome to your new role. I'm delighted to have you in this important expanded responsibility. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon the evolving landscape across healthcare, primarily around drug pricing and our relationship within the supply chain.","When I think about potential new developments, I step back and look at how we've adapted to and driven change in the healthcare industry, how we've broadened our capabilities well beyond the core function of distributing pharmaceuticals, how our services drive affordability, access and quality, supporting the value we deliver and how I think about future drug price changes.","To take a deeper dive into these areas, first, all of McKesson's brand pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with biotechnology and pharmaceutical, or as we refer to them, biopharma companies; unlike the industry standard practice before we had these distribution service agreements. Our relationships between wholesalers and their biopharma partners are now governed and driven by these agreements and have been for several years.","The partnership with biopharma companies has led to increased transparency and a more stable and predictable supply chain with inventory levels that are appropriate to meet customer demands and service levels. We've continued to evolve our relationships, reducing the economic variability in our distribution agreements and reducing our reliance on pricing decisions made by biopharma companies to approximately 5% of our total branded compensation.","As many of you know, we have been revising our terms when we renew agreements with our supplier and customer partners to encompass the broad array of services and capabilities we offer. We've implemented differentiated pricing across each category of product we provide services for; specialty, brand, generic, biosimilar and OTC classes of medicine. Our approach is designed to provide our suppliers and customers with transparency into the unique dynamics of each product category as opposed to a blended approach.","For almost two decades, we have expanded our capabilities beyond distribution and related services to support our partners at nearly every step in the product lifecycle. Examples include RelayHealth Pharmacy and CoverMyMeds, both technology businesses that help reduce the price of drugs and improve patient adherence. And with our newly rebranded manufacturer solutions business now called McKesson Life Sciences, we are taking another step forward to become the partner of choice for life science industry, driving successful commercialization, launch, and in-market solutions to connect patients to life-changing therapies.","While we acknowledge there is more work to do, the nature of what we do every day is aligned with the objectives of the administration, which includes affordability, leveraging our global scale to provide patients with low-cost generics, access, delivering one-third of all prescriptions in North America and quality, ensuring safe and efficient access to prescribe therapies every day.","Finally, while there is much speculation around potentially dramatic reform changes, we believe there will be gradual major transitions should there be any changes to supply chain dynamics.","In summary, we are confident in our ability to navigate changes to the existing healthcare supply chain because changes to our financial model are not new. As was the case with the changes to the supply chain in the past, we expect our biopharma partners to work with us in collaboration with our customers to ensure a seamless transition to avoid disruption to patients. And we are proactively engaged in ongoing dialogue with our customers and biopharma partners in assessing the existing financial models. We also continue to have broader policy discussions with the administration, policy makers and various trade associations that are important to our business.","Turning now to our business results, our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2%. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in this business.","We're pleased with the performance of our McKesson Life Sciences business, as all top 20 biopharma companies utilize a majority of our best-in-class services, and we continue to expand those relationships, providing evidence that our offerings are resonating.","The Department of Veterans Affairs exercised their option to extend our agreement for another two years, as expected in our guide. And ClarusONE continues to leverage our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities.","Turning now to McKesson Europe; on our last earnings call we mentioned increased competition in France, and that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historical levels, and greater than we had planned for on our fiscal 2019 guide. Facing the challenging market in the UK due to reimbursement cuts and declining prescription volumes, we took action last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations. As these trends evolved in the UK, we continue to evaluate our footprint and cost structure and our UK colleagues remained committed to stabilizing the business and repositioning it for long-term profitability, all led by a newly-appointed president with more than a decade of industry experience.","We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting, and we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing a range of healthcare services.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business; the underlying business continues to deliver consistent results benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. And of course, our recent MSD acquisition, which will contribute more meaningfully to earnings as we move from the integration phase to realizing anticipated synergies over time.","As evidence of further enhancing our value proposition, we recently announced a technology solution that complements our existing connectivity capabilities, provides us with access to a broader customer base, and allows patients to get more control over their care and additional support with products delivered to their home. Allows home health and hospice providers to save time and money, and spend more time delivering patient care, and it allows payers to receive improved accuracy in billing, to facilitate more timely reimbursement.","While many have alluded to the threat of new entrance, McKesson has been actively investing in our Medical-Surgical business to better serve patients and ensure we remain the trusted partner in the alternate site markets. In particular, we've made increased investments in home healthcare, adding to our home delivery capabilities, which is driving top-line growth. While this investment is dilutive to our margin rate today, over time these investments will drive increased adjusted operating profit growth as we optimize operations and further leverage our scale. And we are pleased with the response we're seeing from our efforts to improve patient care in the home.","Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare all included in other. We saw upside in the quarter driven by a reversal of a contractual liability, partially offset by previously-discussed generic price actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in October last year.","During the quarter, McKesson Canada made great progress on mitigating the impact of the generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1. And together with strong organic growth in our Canadian and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions businesses, we were able to offset a lower-adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. Britt will go into more detail on the performance of these businesses.","Based on the McKesson fiscal second quarter results, we are narrowing and raising the low end of our adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share for our full-year fiscal 2019 outlook. Despite anticipated challenges coming into the year, we expect a stronger second half of fiscal 2019. And as I look beyond fiscal 2019, the actions we are taking in our UK businesses are focused on addressing the disappointing reimbursement dynamics we are facing with new leadership to drive improved performance.","As we focus on putting patient care first, we're investing in our businesses like homecare delivery. Similarly, McKesson Life Sciences enables biopharma companies to connect their innovative therapies to the patients that need them. And what ties these examples together is our focus on the patient, under our multi-year strategic growth initiative, with the goal of improving care delivery and driving long-term performance.","Before I hand the call over to Britt, let me touch upon the recent weather events that impacted the Southeastern United States. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided significant impacts to our associates, our operations, and our facilities from the devastation resulting from the recent storms and flooding. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas, despite very challenging conditions. Our employees and the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced residents and coworkers. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected customers, communities and employees.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. Let's jump right into our second quarter results, and please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today.","As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 second quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Turning to slide six of the presentation, second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.60 was principally driven by a lower tax rate, including a discrete tax benefit, a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and a lower share count. These benefits were partially offset by incremental challenges in our UK and French businesses, previously announced customer losses, and increased litigation expenses related to opioids.","Our second quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP-only items; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.75 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.27 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related credits of $0.08 per diluted share, restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.34 per diluted share, and other adjustment net credits of $0.19 per diluted share.","Before I continue with the review of our second quarter results, let me take a moment to discuss the increased opioid-related expenses, including anticipated costs for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Earlier this year, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act, which required the creation of an aggregate $100 million annual surcharge that's attributed amongst all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. The first annual surcharge is assessed for calendar year 2018, payable in January of 2019, and measured based on opioids sold or distributed in calendar year 2017.","The New York Department of Health notified manufacturers and distributors of this new law in mid-May. Given the timing of this new law, we did not include an assumption for the potential impact in our fiscal 2019 plan. While this newly-adopted law is currently being challenged in court, we have recorded an accrual to account for McKesson's estimated portion of the calendar year-to-date assessment, should we be required to pay the stewardship assessment in January of 2019. This accrual is reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. It's recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results.","In addition, McKesson's a defendant, often named with pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains and other wholesalers, in numerous cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies. McKesson's recorded expenses associated with these cases, which have far exceeded our initial expectations and are significantly higher than the charges incurred in fiscal 2018. These expenses are reflected within our Corporate segment and are recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results.","Total adjusted operating expenses from both the New York legislation and costs to support ongoing litigation were approximately $34 million in the second quarter and $61 million year-to-date. For fiscal 2019, we now anticipate these opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million. We'll continue to provide updates on these items as more information becomes available.","Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated second quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 9. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 2% versus the prior period on a reported and constant-currency basis, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by customer losses and our sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business or EIS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by market growth and acquisitions.","Second quarter adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisitions, offset by a reversal of a contractual liability and the divestiture of our EIS business. During the quarter, McKesson negotiated a reversal to a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare. As a result, McKesson realized a pre-tax benefit of $90 million in both our GAAP and adjusted operating expenses within our consolidated P&L. Adjusted income from operations was $983 million for the quarter, a decrease of 6% from the prior year.","We now expect adjusted income from operations to decline in the low-to-mid single digits year-over-year, versus our original expectation of flat-to-mid single digit growth. Interest expense of $66 million in the quarter decreased 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings. Our adjusted tax rate was16.2% for the quarter, primarily driven by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $42 million and our mix of business. We now assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17% to 19% for the full year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter.","Additionally, income to attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $714 million, with second quarter adjusted earnings at $3.60 per diluted share, which is up 10% compared to $3.28 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 199 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $580 million of share repurchases, and we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 197 million for the year.","Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on slides 11 through 15. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We report results in three main segments; U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All other businesses, which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other.","As a reminder, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, contribution from EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed approximately $120 million in revenues and $17 million in adjusted operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $240 million in revenues and $34 million in adjusted operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2018.","Let me start now with the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41.6 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses and branded-to-generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 5% to $635 million, driven by customer losses and lower branded pharmaceutical compensation than the prior year, partially offset by strong growth across our specialty businesses, including acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 153 basis points, a decrease of 12 basis points, driven by a growing mix of specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although they're dilutive to the margin rate.","Specific to brand compensation, we have lowered our assumption for branded pharmaceutical price increases in the U.S. to mid-single digit percentage from our prior assumption of mid-to-high single digit percentage. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed in nature versus variable, with the fixed component representing approximately 95% of the compensation we receive. I would also reiterate my previous comments at a healthcare conference in September. If in the second half of fiscal 2019, manufacturers do not take any price increases, the impact to our adjusted operating profit would be a range of approximately $75 million to $90 million, or approximately 2% to 3% of our adjusted EPS. We'll provide an update on the brand pricing environment when we report our third quarter earnings in late January.","And as a result of our expectation for increased stewardship expenses in New York related to opioids that I discussed earlier and our updated expectations for brand pricing, we now expect to be at the low end of original fiscal 2019 guidance assumption of flat-to-down mid-single digit adjusted operating profit for the segment.","Next moving on to European Pharmaceutical Solutions; revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter, down 2%, negatively impacted by $68 million from currency rate movements.","On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven by the previously-disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and challenging operating environments in the UK and France. These items were partially offset by strong performance in the other countries that we operate in.","Segment adjusted operating profit was down 40% to $53 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 39% to $54 million driven primarily by the impact of the previously-announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our UK business, and increased competition in the French wholesale market. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 81 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 50 basis points.","As a result of the weak second quarter segment performance as well as our updated view that mitigation efforts will not materialize as quickly as originally planned, we now expect segment adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year with a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half. While we continue to experience challenges in this segment, we're encouraged by the performance we're seeing in most all the other countries that we operate in; however that contribution is not material enough to offset the challenges in the UK and France.","Moving now into Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 17%, driven by the MSD acquisition and market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 6%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 1% to $138 million, driven primarily by market growth, partially offset by $8 million of higher bad debt expense in the quarter.","Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 708 basis points, a decrease of 111 basis points, reflecting our mix of business, including the growth in lower-margin products such as Rx, previously-discussed bad debt in the quarter, and our continued investment in the homecare delivery business, as well as the lower relative margin contribution from MSD.","We are very pleased with the progress in integration activities of the newly-acquired MSD business. As we move through the integration phase and to executing on the synergies, MSD, like most acquisitions, will begin to deliver operating profit accretion. This is consistent with our previously-discuss assumption that the MSD acquisition will be modestly accretive for adjusted earnings in fiscal 2019.","Finishing our business review with Other; revenues were $2.9 billion for the quarter, down 5%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven primarily by the sale of the EIS business, partially offset by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions.","Other adjusted operating profit was up 24% to $300 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $310 million, driven by the previously-mentioned reversal through a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business, or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, and the sale of the EIS business.","In Canada, our Rexall business faced some challenges in the quarter. Actions taken earlier in the year are not materializing as fast as we anticipated, resulting in a lower performance than expected. We remain confident and committed to this business and will continue to focus on addressing these challenges with an eye on long-term sustainability.","Additionally, we previously identified the impact of government actions in minimum wage increases as a gross pre-tax fiscal 2019 headwind of between $100 million and $120 million and discussed our efforts to mitigate that impact. I'm pleased with the work of our Canadian team, who have identified and begun implementing action plans that we anticipate will offset more than half of the $100 million to $120 million gross headwind, the benefits of which are expected to be captured primarily in the second half of the year.","Posing our segment review with Change Healthcare, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $56 million for the quarter. We're pleased with the operational performance of Change Healthcare. Adjusted EBITDA performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. This solid operational performance was offset by increased investments in growth areas, higher tax expense, and higher interest expense.","Due to the second quarter results and our expectation that these below-the-line dynamics will continue, we now expect the adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare to decline year-over-year relative to our original guide of low-to mid-single digit growth, and we expect a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half.","We now expect other adjusted operating profit to increase year-over-year, driven by the benefit from a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and higher-than-anticipated growth in our MRxTS business, partially offset by the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare.","Next, McKesson recorded $143 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 55% in constant currency year-over-year, primarily driven by opioid-related expenses and planned technology investments. As a result of the outlook for opioid-related expenses that I discussed earlier, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses will increase year-over-year.","I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flows, which can be found on slide 16. For receivables, days sales outstanding decreased one day to 26 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day to 30 days, and days payables outstanding decreased two days from the prior year to 59 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion. For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $840 million for acquisitions, repurchased $877 million in common stock, and paid $139 million in dividends. McKesson generated $318 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting the $248 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had free cash flow of $70 million, which was modestly ahead of our expectations.","In fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. We also have a total of $4.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in January.","In terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution, which is similar to prior years. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate that our higher-than-expected second quarter adjusted earnings per share results and lower full-year adjusted tax rate will be partially offset by ongoing litigation and stewardship costs related to opioids and the lower profit contribution from our European business. As a result, we're narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook. We now anticipate adjusted EPS of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share in fiscal 2019.","Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. We're focused on the alignment of our operating structure to support the growth initiatives that we have previously outlined. Additionally, we continue to focus on controlling our operating expenses, which will provide the flexibility to make investments into the business and drive operating leverage.","Throughout the second quarter, we made progress furthering the priority to evolve our operating structure with particular emphasis in the areas of finance, technology, human resources and on indirect spend. We've made progress in several areas, but I'd like to highlight three.","First, we are evolving our operating structure and related spend management. As a result, we've launched more disciplined and rigorous internal spend guidelines across the enterprise to support sustainable spend reductions.","Second, we're transitioning several business unit functional and back-office services to a more centralized hub model, leveraging outsourcing and technology. This results in a realignment of functions to report in a more centralized manner, improving service delivery and increasing focus on our operations and on customers and patients.","And third, we are accelerating technology adoption, including increasing the use of robotics processing automation, AI and data and analytics to deliver more efficient and accurate service and output.","These efforts will generate meaningful savings for the organization, driving increased productivity and efficiency, allowing our teams to focus on higher-value activities for the company and for our customers. These are just a sample of the initiatives that are underway as McKesson transforms its operating model to drive cost savings. And we have line-of-sight to many more initiatives that will drive additional savings. McKesson expects that these initiatives will drive approximately $300 million to $400 million in annual pre-tax savings that will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we're making and the change that we're driving at McKesson. And most importantly, I'm energized by the commitment and engagement of our McKesson employees across the globe that are driving this effort.","In closing, we're narrowing and raising our fiscal 2019 outlook of adjusted earnings to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. We are making solid progress against our multi-year strategic growth initiative. While we faced incremental challenges in fiscal 2019, particularly in our European business, we anticipate that the second half of the year will ramp due to seasonality, organic growth, the realization of synergies from acquisitions and the benefits from mitigation efforts. Our leadership position and ability to execute combined with increased focus on reducing costs across the organization and investing in our priority growth areas, give me confidence in McKesson's future.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I'd ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Caller, your line is open.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning and thank you for all the color so far. I want to tie a little bit into the broader picture of drug pricing. Britt, you reiterated your view on what happens at the beginning of the year, or at least for your guidance, if there's no increases in the typical January 1 timeframe. As you think about what that could imply for the changing dynamics of the market as a whole, especially with news this morning about apparent changes to Part B coming, how do you think about positioning yourself and contracting with manufacturers, contracting with customers in a world where there continues to be a moving target on what that reference rate and what that pricing dynamic could be over time?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Well, Mike, thanks for that question. I think I would reiterate that, again, we have changed our assumption on branded price inflation to the mid-single digits. And I would reiterate my comments, if pricing inflation does go away then we expect that, that range could be $75 million to $90 million. I would also remind you that we have talked about over time, how we've continued to evolve our relationships and our agreements with manufacturers, as well as evolving our relationships and agreements with customers.","And we believe that it's important for us to put the economics on each individual product that we service to our customers so that it reflects the services that we provide on those products for manufacturers to our customers. And so we continue to have strong dialogue with both manufacturers and customers. We continue to work with them and partner with them and try to understand the evolving dynamics. And we'll continue to evolve our relationships and our agreements such that we're being paid a fair value for the services that we perform on each of the product categories that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks a lot. I'll let others ask questions.","Operator","Next we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Good morning. John and Brian \u2013 John, I appreciated your comments at the beginning, but I want to really try to understand how to think about McKesson going forward. So, we talk about drug pricing, we talk about changes that are happening in D.C. I heard you talk about your Life Science business and maybe make incremental acquisitions there. As you think about the different businesses that you have today, for example, international that hasn't worked quite the way you anticipated when you bought Celesio, how do we think about McKesson over the next few years? Does it make sense to continue to invest in that business outside the U.S.? Are there larger incremental acquisition opportunities you see within Life Sciences?","And then, as we think about, for example, your oncology business and this changing dynamic around pricing, are there other acquisitions that you need to make? Are there business model changes that need to be made? I know this is a big question, but I think if we just think about how McKesson is going to be positioned over the next few years, I think it'd be really helpful to hear your thoughts.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thanks, Lisa, for the question there. And clearly that was a big question covering lots of different subjects. I think that if you look at McKesson historically, we've done I think a really good job of managing our portfolio of businesses. So first, as you pointed out, we're not afraid to buy and sell businesses and to react where we see the market opportunities emerging. Clearly, Brian was a big part of that in his previous role in corporate strategy and business development and will play a very important role in his new capacity.","We think we are in the right businesses at the right time. You mentioned a couple of times our McKesson Life Sciences business and our continued increased exposure to the biopharma industry and these new product launches that are coming out. We believe there's not only an opportunity for us to make money in our core distribution businesses related to this innovation, but perhaps as important, or maybe more important, a lot of these biopharma companies are beginning to turn to McKesson and our Life Sciences business to provide them with incremental support that helps them get the product to market, improve the adherence and compliance to these products, help the patient get access to both the drug as well as expert advice and support, and also get the right payment structure set up so these patients can qualify with their payers and health plans to be covered for the use of these medications. So, we feel really good about where we are and we think we're positioned properly.","When you think about changes to the pricing dynamic, I think Britt did a nice job of outlining for you how much risk McKesson might have related to price inflation. We've tried to bound that risk for investors so you have a sense for how meaningful or how little meaning it has to us at this point in our evolution. Years ago, we began to move our model away from a dependence on price inflation on the brand side to create value, and we think our new relationships continue to evolve nicely in that area.","Clearly, there have been people talking about this whole idea of a list price reduction. We believe what we received from manufacturers represents a fair payment for the value that we deliver on an ongoing basis. So we believe very strongly we will continue to have a revenue-based relationship with biopharma, and that that relationship may be modified over time as necessary if we find that the prices change in a significant way.","And then you mentioned our oncology exposure. We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing in our oncology business particularly, which is part of part of our Specialty Solutions business. And not only is the U.S. oncology business growing rapidly with a significant increase in the number of physicians and practices that are involved in U.S. oncology, but we're finding that the market in general finds our value proposition compelling and that solutions we bring are very differentiated in the market, and we are gaining significant momentum in oncology particularly.","When you think about pricing risk in that market, clearly various reimbursement strategies have been used over decades in community oncology, and our community oncologists have very resiliently moved their business practice and model to reflect the value and the service they deliver to their patients.","We don't believe the administration or anyone that's a payer for healthcare would like to see oncology services move away from the community setting. First of all, it won't be as convenient and as accessible for the patients in America. We don't think it'll improve quality, and it clearly will increase costs if these patients and physicians migrate to a more acute setting.","So, albeit there may be changes in the way payment structures move, but we've had significant success even recently with the Oncology Care Model experiment that took place with Medicare to help us prove that we can deliver in a value-based way a more all-encompassing treatment process in a way that delivered the quality that was reflected and required in the Oncology Care Model. So it wasn't necessarily drug dependent.","So, I think if we see some changes in the way that it's done, it's not clear that it'll affect oncology particularly. If it does, we think our practices and our partnerships are prepared to make that transition and work with the payers to be paid for the service.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Thank you for all the comments. I appreciate it.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, welcome, Lisa.","Operator","And next we'll go to Eric Percher with Nephron Research.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. Thanks for all the detail on how your expectations have changed during the course of the first two quarters. Maybe one specific question, which is, as you laid out guidance for the year, did you expect that you might see the change benefit occur in fiscal year 2019?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Eric, thanks for that question. As we laid out, this was in connection with our original Change Healthcare transaction. It was not part of our original guidance. It was a negotiated agreement that happened during the second quarter. So we did not have that visibility as we laid out our original guidance, and it was not included in it.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. And, Britt, could you rank order the items that have created headwinds as you entered the year? I want to make sure we have some sense of the magnitude for these moving items.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Eric. I think, as we've called out here, certainly Europe has been a challenge for us. And I think we've laid out for you some of the dynamics that have created that challenge. We did lay out for you in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment that, before the year, we did have some customer losses, and those customer losses were anticipated. They were part of our guide. And from a year-over-year basis, they have created a headwind for us.","Beyond that, we also laid out for you at the beginning of the year the Canadian reimbursement or Canadian generics price decline. We laid out for you what the gross headwind was there. We've made tremendous progress in mitigating that. And as I laid out, we believe we've mitigated over half of that and should start to see some of the benefits in the second half of the year.","But we obviously have felt the impact on that the first half of the year. And then we've continued to make investments in our business, and I talked about some of the planned technology investments that are running through our Corporate segment. We believe that these are going to help us optimize our cost structure and our model going forward. And while there are headwinds this year from a cost perspective, these are the investments that are going to really give us the type of flexibility that we need as we go forward.","And then the last thing that I would point out is I gave more description on it certainly this quarter are the costs related to opioids and the opioid-related expenses. And as I pointed out, we have experienced a significant amount of costs in our first half of the year and I also tried to provide you and what our estimate is going to be for the full year on these opioid-related expenses. So I don't know if that's a perfect rank order for you, but I wanted to really summarize for you the headwinds and how we've made progress against some of these headwinds, particularly in Canada.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. As I think about the performance during the quarter, U.S. pharma still beat despite brand pricing coming in below expectations. So is that just generics driving that? And then, what are your expectations on generics going forward? And what are you seeing there in terms of pricing trend and contribution to the P&L?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks Brian for the question. I'll ask Britt to talk specifically about pricing trends as we see it both on, sort of, the buy side of generics as well as what we're seeing on the sell side. But speaking at a higher level related to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I would say that we are beginning to see a very nice stabilization of that business. We talked about customer churn coming into the year. We believe strongly in our value proposition, and we continue to create great relationships with our customers, and I think we see that business reaching a point of recovery with the potential outlying risks still associated with what happens from a pricing model perspective related to governmental changes or big pharma, biopharma policy changes. But maybe he could talk specifically about generics.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Sure, and what I would add to that, certainly we're seeing that stabilization in our U.S. Pharma business. We're also seeing really strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business, and John talked about that at the beginning of the call. So that's also embedded in there. In terms of how we think about pricing on the generic side, we've talked about this now for the last couple of quarters. On the sell side, we continue to see a very competitive yet stable environment.","And on the buy side, we have seen that the rate of deflation has stabilized over the last several quarters. And in some product categories, we are seeing certain molecules and product categories firming up from a price perspective on the buy side. So the environment overall is in a more stable state than it has been in the last \u2013 or that has been 18 months ago. And we're certainly in a great position with our ClarusONE sourcing operation to continue to create great buying opportunities that we can provide good cost savings for our customers, as well as to really create that spread between the buy side and the sell side. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to source well through ClarusONE with a more stabilized environment, it really sets us up quite nicely.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Hey, Britt, just to follow up on the back-half guidance specifically on the U.S. business, you're now expecting it to be down towards the bottom end of the range, down mid-single digits. It seems like obviously the declines in the back half would be worse obviously than the front half in order to get to that bottom of the range, and you did share some of the moving pieces and expectations. But could you maybe just break out for us again, of the expected decline in the back half, how much of it is from the anticipated opioid expense versus some of your changes and assumptions around things like branded pricing?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty segment, we do have certain costs related to the New York State Stewardship. So that will be in a part of our second half. And as we think about branded price inflation, we did give you an updated assumption around our guidance. So at the beginning of the year, we gave you mid-to high-single digit assumption for branded price inflation. We've now updated that to give more of a mid-single digit price inflation assumption. So those would be the two pieces that I would call out that have helped us to clarify for you our guidance assumption around closer to the lower end of our original range for U.S. Pharma.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's super helpful. And then, Britt, just one follow-up on the free cash flow. I think it's about, what, $70 million through the first two quarters? You're still sticking with the $3 billion for the year. Can you maybe just help us understand what bridges that gap? What are some of the timing issues at play as far as cash flow for the back half?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Sure. As I mentioned, you're right. It's $70 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year. Typically, we do see, because of seasonality, also because of just the timing of how certain customer payments happen during the year, that our fourth quarter is our strongest cash flow performance. And we expect that to continue again this year.","So our first half of the year, as I mentioned, is slightly ahead of our own internal expectation, and we would continue to expect to generate $3 billion with a stronger second half performance, which is typical to prior years.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just in relation to the UK pharmacy operations, the other publicly-traded company with large retail pharmacy operations in the UK seemed to be performing maybe a little bit better relative to your operations. I know there are some differences in revenue and profit mix between pharmacy versus front end when comparing these operations, but the two quick questions I have tied to this is, one, is there any strategic consideration on your part to perhaps diminish your exposure to pharmacy and focus more on front end in the UK?","And then just quickly, number two on this, you mentioned in the press release you continue to have conversations with the UK government to discuss the value-added pharmacies, low-cost setting of care, et cetera. It's unclear just from the outside whether or not these types of lobby efforts have really helped to improve any reimbursements. I was just curious to just, generally, have there been any historical examples you can recall where some overly aggressive UK reimbursement cuts were perhaps reversed and there was some relief for pharmacy providers? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think those are very important questions, and it's terrific to have Brian on the call given that his most recent responsibility was to run our European operations. And he, in particular, spent a lot of time in the UK both in terms of the operations of the UK, but also the political environment of the regulators. So Brian, why don't you take that question for us?","Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation","Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for the question. So I'd start with the first question of mix, and clearly the model of some of our competitors is quite different than the model we have in the UK. They tend to be much more front shop, health and beauty focused, might comprise as much as 60% to 65% of their overall mix where historically we've been a very healthcare, pharmacy-focused organization with roughly 85% to 90% of our mix from the Pharmaceutical segment itself.","As we think about the front shop of that business, we continue to think about how we migrate to an overall healthcare value proposition, which puts retail pharmacy more in the front and center of the provision of care in the community. That could impact the mix of types of products we put in the front shop, and we're actively working through our merchandising strategies in that regard.","The second thing you asked about, I believe, was just NHS policy overall, and we continue to be in very active dialogue with the regulators in the UK to champion our view. And we believe it's a view they actually share, that community pharmacy plays an important role in the overall population health of the communities that they serve. And so we continue to evolve our model in that direction. Clearly, the reimbursement landscape has been a challenging one for us, not just in the magnitude of the cuts we absorb, but in the difficulty of predicting when and how those cuts have hit us.","I would say we are encouraged by the dialogue we're having, and you would see earlier this week, in fact NHS announced that they are going to keep the reimbursement rates for pharmacy flat for the coming year, where the original intent had been to impose some more decline. So, we view that as certainly incrementally positive news for us.","I guess I'd just leave you with the thought that the team there is actively engaged on the policy arena, we're actively engaged with manufacturer partners as we reposition this business. And we continue to believe that it will play an important part in provision of health care in the UK.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Brian. Next question, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, guys. Given sort of where the stock is trading today, both on a sort of EBIT, EBITDA or P\/E basis and where the free cash flow yield is, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of internal versus external investments? And I guess that \u2013 I know you've always been balanced in how you've done it, but obviously this is really unique time in terms of valuation for your business.","And then secondarily, on the M&A side, you had done some things on the technology front. You've moved into a couple of higher growth areas also in Med-Surg, as you talked about at Life Sciences. How would you, kind of, characterize the pipeline for some of those growthier assets and whether you think you're getting paid for some of those businesses you're moving into, kind of getting back to the original question, and the multiple that the market's implying for you overall?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Ross, thanks for that question. I'll start and then John can certainly add to this. From a capital deployment perspective, I would just reiterate my comments that we did repurchase shares in the second quarter, $580 million. We believe that a balanced approach still is appropriate for us. You've seen us balance our capital deployment during the year. We've made investments such as MSD. We've also returned capital. So we've really been very balanced this year in terms of cash.","We like businesses like MSD because they provide good growth opportunities for us. They're in businesses that we know and have operated for a long period of time. They also fit into our strategic growth initiatives, so where there's opportunities such as MSD, we're certainly going to take advantage of looking at those and evaluating those.","We also believe, though, that our shares are attractively priced. And we talked about the share authorization that is still outstanding. Our management and board both feel that the shares are attractively priced, and we've continued to execute share repurchases as a result of that. And John, if you want to add to the M&A pipeline?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, clearly, we are in the market. We're always active in the market evaluating transactions, and I think we make long-term bets on where we think the growth is going to be. To your point, some of the \u2013 in fact all of the recent acquisitions are performing very well for us and are producing returns that are significantly above our long-term cost to capital. We look at cash flow generation out of these businesses, and that's an important characteristic. And we can see our path to growing that cash flow. So, we're going to continue to use that combination. We're going to be disciplined. Clearly, the value of our own stock at these rates is, on a relative basis, improving in its attractiveness to us. And we're not blind to that, and we'll continue to be disciplined.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thank you. I'll look forward to that.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","You're welcome.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","I think we have time for one more, operator. Alan?","Operator","Yes, sir. We'll take our last question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the details. John, both Gilead and Amgen announced their lower WAC for some existing product. Can you share with us your views on what are you seeing the implications are for the industry, and if you had conversations with the manufacturers on what that means to your existing contracts?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, we have constant conversations with manufacturers, Ricky, as you know, and as we've said earlier on the call and on other calls, we are very focused on making sure we get a fair return for the value that we deliver to these manufacturers. We can't control what they do from a pricing perspective, but we certainly have a significant relationship that delivers tremendous value to the manufacturers and gives them access to our customers, most of which buy only from us, in a way that is really important.","We continue to evaluate the economics of these changes from a price perspective, and we plan to maintain the economics that we've realized in the past on these products, certainly regardless of where the price point gets set. So that's our position, and we believe the manufacturers respect that and will continue to provide us with the right payment for the service that we continue to provide.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I want to thank everybody on the call today for your time. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible, and especially their commitment to helping their communities and each other during times of need.","I'll now hand the call over to Craig for his review on upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On Tuesday, November 13, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On Tuesday, November 27, we will present at the Evercore ISI HealthCONx, the conference in Boston. And in early January 2019, we will present at the J.P. Morgan HealthCare Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you and goodbye.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Ana Schrank","Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and will then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we'll open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. ","Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Anna, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with our business performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and with our announced agreement to purchase the independent banner and franchise businesses of the Katz Group Canada. For those of you unfamiliar with Katz Group Canada, it is a privately owned company that operates an integrated retail pharmacy network in Canada. Katz is a long-time valued McKesson customer, and we are excited about this transaction. I will talk about the acquisition in more detail later in the call.","For our third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $30.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.40. Our results were solid for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions, which was helped by our acquisition of US Oncology. ","Based on our year-to-date performance, we are maintaining our guidance range and expect adjusted earnings between $6.19 and $6.39 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. ","Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business. ","Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business led the way with another strong revenue result and solid expense control, which contributed nicely to the segment's growth. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return.","Generics play an ever more significant role in U.S. Pharmaceutical. In the third quarter, one of the important launches was for the generic version of LIPITOR. Thus far, the launch has been tracking nicely, and we expect it to meet our original full year expectations. We've also been pleased with the relative price stability within the broader generics market, which is in line with our original forecast.","In our Specialty Health business, we hit the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of U.S. Oncology. Our focus is shifted from the integration of the 2 companies to now we are operating the business combined in delivering an expanded value proposition to our market. We have a broad diverse specialty business with solutions not only for oncology but for a number of complex disease states. ","In addition, we have the innovative practice management and clinical support solutions that came to us to the US Oncology acquisition and a world-class vaccine distribution business and a leading risk mitigation set of programs. These collective capabilities will help hospitals, community oncologists and other multi-specialty providers improve the integrated care experience for patients and drive business and clinical innovation.","Finally, for both the third quarter and year-to-date, generics played an important role in specialty performance, but as certain molecules progress in our life cycle, that contribution will moderate going forward. ","Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 2% in the quarter, reflecting steady market growth, partially offset by the fact that we experienced the majority of our sales of flu vaccine in the second quarter instead of the third quarter. ","We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing our sourcing of McKesson brand where we deliver high-quality private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management.","Turning now to our Canadian business. We announced today our intent to acquire the independent banner and franchise businesses of Katz Group for approximately CAD $920 million. We expect this acquisition will close in the first half of calendar 2012. This transaction is of strategic value to us, and financially, it will generate a nice return in excess of our hurdle rates. ","On an adjusted earnings basis, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to McKesson's earnings in our current fiscal year and approximately $0.10 to $0.20 accretive in the first fiscal year after closing. ","In addition to the acquisition, we will also continue to serve as the primary pharmaceutical distributor to the Katz corporate-owned stores. We believe this transaction is a good fit with our long-term objectives in Canada and supports our business strategy of expanding our retail and distribution presence in Canada and growing our sales of higher margin products and services. ","McKesson Canada has a long history of supporting independent pharmacies through our banner offering, our retail automation solutions and our specialty offering. The addition of the banner and franchise operations of Katz reinforces our ongoing commitment to the independent segment. ","McKesson Canada currently operates a number of banner groups including Proxim, Associated Retail Pharmacy and Family Health Care Pharmacy. The new banner groups that we intend to acquire from Katz will be operated in a manner similar to the 3 existing banners, which means member pharmacies will remain owners of their pharmacies and will be responsible for the management of their business while benefiting from McKesson's expertise and wide range of solutions. ","Banners in Canada provide a broad range of services to their members, which results in the banner itself generating profits through purchasing, marketing and adherence programs. We have been developing our operating in this area for the past few years with the acquisition of Proxim in 2008, as an example. ","According to a survey conducted in one of Qu\u00e9bec's leading business magazines, Proxim ranks #1 for customer experience compared to other pharmacies in the province. Due to the scale of this transaction, their offering to the value-added services to all of our banner customers will be enhanced.","We built a recognized brand in Canada with strong positions in every market segment and close customer relationships. We believe this acquisition allows us to maintain a leadership position in the market. This transaction will allow us to leverage the strengths of our complementary businesses, such as specialty and automation with the Drug Trading and Medicine Shoppe Canada customer base.","Turning now to our results in our existing Canadian business. Coming into our fiscal year, we talked about the challenges we would face due to the effect of public policy-related price reductions on generic drugs. Over the course of the year, our Canadian team has worked to offset the impact of the price reductions. We focused on generic compliance gains with customers, expense control measures and capitalizing in global sourcing and branded generic pharmaceuticals. I'm pleased to say that these mitigation efforts have been very successful.","To sum up. In Distribution Solutions, we had a good third quarter performance, resulted from our terrific combination of assets, and I have confidence in our full year performance.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. In the December quarter, we announced a series of product strategy changes in our hospital business to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle solutions. And in conjunction, we announced that we would stop development of one of our revenue cycle management products, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. ","As a result of this decision, our third quarter results included a pretax charge of $42 million. Excluding the charge, I'm pleased with our performance across the segment. The businesses that make up Technology Solutions performed well this quarter, resulting in strong revenue growth and adjusted operating margin enhancement. ","With customers in virtually every healthcare segment, McKesson has a unique view of the healthcare industry. Over the past couple of years, with the introduction of Meaningful Use and the drive toward universal health IT adoption, the needs of the market and our customers have changed. ","A top near-term priority for our hospital and health system partners is managing the increase regulatory complexity. We are committed to getting our customers through Meaningful Use 2 and 3, and ensuring our solutions comply with HIPAA 5010 and ICD-10. Our customers also need a path to the future as they assume greater risk, coordinate care, manage populations and collaborate with payers and others in the community.  Through the strategic use of information technology, McKesson can provide our customers with a broad perspective on what it takes to solve complex issues that they face. ","Across all of our technology businesses, we are continuing to invest significant R&D dollars to develop solutions that address the needs of our customers, both today and as healthcare reform unfolds. ","Over time, we plan to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle health IT capabilities for the Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon's Microsoft platform. Paragon is an integrated core clinical and revenue cycle suite built from the ground up over the past 12 years. With a single database that then becomes a complete clinical and financial repository. We are confident we can continue to serve our customers well with an integrated core clinical and revenue cycle solution as their foundation, complemented by our broader set of assets. With our payer-facing health solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, we can connect our hospital and health system partners to their communities, helping them align with physicians, coordinate care, create patient-centered medical homes and form relationships with payers and others. ","This quarter we made good progress in our Provider Technology businesses with implementations of both of our Horizon and Paragon systems, and I'm pleased with how the implementations have rolled out during the quarter. In addition, our Transaction Processing business continues to steady - continues its steady performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our progress in Technology Solutions, and I'm confident we have the right set of assets.","As the largest healthcare services and technology company, McKesson is committed to working with all participants in healthcare to develop innovations that lead to healthcare systems that are simultaneously high-performing, accessible and economically sustainable.","In summary, I'm confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased to have the financial flexibility to announce today's agreement with Katz Group, as well as the $650 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson delivered solid third quarter operating results, in line with our expectations, but our results did include a $42 million product alignment charge in our Technology Solutions segment in the quarter. Overall, one month into the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year.","Let me briefly start by mentioning one other item that while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically the $27 million AWP litigation charge. ","As you recall, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Since then, we have continued to work through the remaining public entity claims. We have been engaged in ongoing settlement discussions to resolve potential and pending federal and state Medicaid program claims relating to AWP. We have now reached agreements in principle with the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general to resolve both federal and state Medicaid claims relating to AWP.  We expect substantial participation in the state settlement, although the final level is not yet known. ","As a result of these agreements and progress made towards potentially resolving other public entity claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $27 million. This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.06 per diluted share.","My remaining comments today will now focus on our $1.40 adjusted EPS, which as you recall, excludes 3 items: acquisition-related expenses; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; and certain litigation reserve adjustments, including the $27 million pretax AWP charge I just discussed. The numbers I will review in my discussion can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, included in today's press release. ","Let me now begin with our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 9% to $30.8 billion. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, total revenues increased 6% for the quarter, with both segments contributing nicely to this result. ","Total adjusted gross profit increased 7% for the quarter to $1.6 billion. There are a number of moving pieces here in each segment so I'll leave further comment until we get to our segment discussion. ","Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter increased 9% to $995 million. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, overall adjusted operating expense grew roughly 3% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating expense growth to be in the neighborhood of 2% to 4%, excluding the impact of US Oncology. ","Other income was a loss of $2 million for the quarter, primarily driven by an asset impairment we recorded in our corporate segment. ","Interest expense of $64 million increased for the quarter, primarily due to the debt we've put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. Our full year assumption of $260 million of interest expense in fiscal 2012 remains unchanged.","Moving now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 31% benefited from $5 million of favorable discrete tax items, but is otherwise roughly in line with the 32% run rate that we continue to expect for the full year.","Adjusted net income for the quarter was $351 million, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.40. As a reminder, this $1.40 adjusted EPS includes approximately $0.11 related to the product alignment charge John discussed earlier, that we took in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter.","To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 251 million. We continue to expect our full year average diluted shares to come in a bit below the original guidance assumption of 253 million shares outstanding.","Let's now move onto a discussion of our 2 segments, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Our Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 9% for the quarter versus the prior year. Direct Distribution and Services revenues grew 11% for the quarter to $21.6 billion. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, third quarter direct revenues increased 7%, primarily due to market growth rates. ","Warehouse revenues were up 10% for the quarter to $5.2 billion, primarily driven by revenues associated with a new customer. ","Canadian revenues, on a constant currency basis, declined 3% for the quarter, due in part to government-imposed price reductions on generics and one less sales day. Including an unfavorable currency impact, revenues decreased 4% for the quarter. ","As John mentioned earlier, the team has done a good job thus far mitigating the regulatory challenges we faced coming into the fiscal year, and our Canadian results continue to track favorably to our original plan.","Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the quarter to $760 million, primarily driven by market growth, along with the fact, as John said, that we saw earlier sales of the flu vaccine this year as compared to last year in our Medical-Surgical business. ","Adjusted gross profit for the segment increased 11% for the quarter to $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit would be up approximately 3%. ","Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating expense was up 10% for the quarter. But excluding US Oncology, our adjusted operating expense growth was just 2%.  We are pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth. ","The adjusted operating margin rate for the segment was 191 basis points this quarter versus 188 basis points a year ago. As you have heard me say many times before, given the quarterly timing fluctuations in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. Therefore, for full year fiscal 2012, we continue to expect Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points.","Moving now to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $42 million pretax product alignment charge, which equates to approximately $0.11 after tax. This charge, which was recorded in our Provider Technology hospital-facing business, was comprised of $22 million of non-cash asset impairments, $6 million for severance, $6 million for customer allowances and $8 million for other product alignment initiatives. ","Total segment revenues were up 4% from the prior year to $823 million, primarily driven by growth in our Provider Technologies business as a result of progress made with customer implementations. ","As a reminder, last year's third quarter included approximately $23 million of previously deferred revenue related to a disease management contract with CMS. So when you exclude the favorable impact of this $23 million in the prior year, Technology Solutions' revenues grew approximately 7% for the quarter versus last year.","Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit decreased 3% to $370 million, driven in part by the current year's product alignment charge. Of the total $42 million charge, $26 million was recorded in the cost of sales line. Excluding both the impact of $26 million from the product alignment charge this year and the $23 million of deferred revenue recognition in the prior year, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased approximately 10% for the quarter. ","Technology Solutions' operating -- adjusted operating expenses increased 8% in the quarter to $282 million. $16 million of the total $42 million product alignment charge was recorded in the adjusted operating expense line. So factoring this out, adjusted operating expenses would have increased just 2% for the quarter.","While we've had tight control on our expenses, we do continue to invest in the business for our customers. Total gross R&D spending in this segment was $113 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 8% compared to 10% a year ago. ","Our adjusted operating margin in this segment was 10.81% for the quarter compared to 15.32% in the prior year. If you exclude the current year product align charge, adjusted operating margin would have been roughly 15.92% for the quarter. ","For the full fiscal year, excluding the product alignment charge, we now expect to be more towards the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal range of 14% to 16%, given the good progress we have made with customer implementations.","Leaving our segment performance, and turning now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Here again, timing can have a meaningful impact on each of our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $9.7 billion, up from the prior year balance of $8.7 billion, and our days sales outstanding increased to 25 days from 24 days last year. ","Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $10.4 billion, while payables were up 15% to $15.7 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 32 days was flat to the prior year, while our days sales and payables increased to 3 days from a year ago to 48 days. ","These working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate in excess of $2 billion in cash flow from operations. ","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.2 billion. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion was offshore and a portion of that balance is expected to fund the acquisition of the Katz Group assets that we announced today. ","In thinking about our domestic cash balance, which does remain above our minimum cash balance needs, we will of course consider our portfolio approach to capital deployment. ","Part of this approach, we are pleased that the Board of Directors recently approved an additional $650 million share repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization is now $1.5 billion, giving us additional flexibility to deploy our capital and maximize shareholder value in a variety of ways.","Overall, our gross to capital ratio was 35% for the quarter, right in the middle of our target range. ","Returning to our cash flows. Capitalized spending was $307 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, trending as expected at $450 million to $500 million for the full year.","Now I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our guidance on adjusted earnings at $6.19 to $6.39. The continued strength we saw across pretty much all of our businesses in both segments effectively offset the product alignment charge we took this quarter as we think about our full year results. ","One final point about our fiscal 2012 outlook. We expect $0.07 for acquisition-related expenses and $0.48 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In addition, due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.37 for litigation reserve adjustments.","In closing, we feel good about our operating results and about the strength of our balance sheet, which supports our portfolio approach to capital deployment. We remain optimistic about the future of our businesses.","Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First up is Robert Willoughby Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John or Jeff, what are you buying with the Katz acquisition exactly in terms of bricks and mortar? And what are the gives and takes of the model? I guess with the current customer now, what kinds of adjustments do you anticipate as making from a revenue standpoint, if any?","John H. Hammergren","I think the way to think about this is that it's very similar to the banner operations we already are involved in operating in Canada. So we will take over the responsibly of owning the banners and operating the banners. And in Canada, I would say that our experience has been we have a more fulsome relationship with those banner operators and the ability to provide additional products and services to those customers that improve our performance and simultaneously improve their performance. So our goal always is to find tools that we can bring to our customers that make them more successful, and in return improving our business performance at the same time. So although, there won't be a lot of incremental revenue associated with the transaction, we certainly believe it will have a very nice returns and well above our cost of capital when you think about it from a financial context.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it's a franchise fee or something you're booking and the distribution revenues, you've probably already included already then?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, that's the way to think about it. We don't own the stores physical plant, and we don't own the \"pharmacists.\" They still operate their stores, but we run the rest of it.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And any -- hazard a guess on the amortization on the deal?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","It's always difficult at this point in the process to know what's going to end up on the balance sheet, it's something we're not going to amortize versus something we're going to amortization. That's why we tried to give you a little bit of guidance on an adjusted EPS basis, so if we're not really sure final noncash amortization will be.","Operator","Next up, we'll hear from Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the acquisition. I think we've all known about some of the reimbursement pressures on generics from the Canadian government. I know this is just one quarter, but sales from the Canadian business looked a little soft this quarter. I guess maybe just why now on the Katz Group? What made the timing right now make sense?","John H. Hammergren","Well, as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we have been very successful at mitigating some of the efforts associated with the regulatory changes, and clearly we have better visibility into those regulatory changes today than we might have had even last year or certainly a couple of years ago. So we understand their effect, and we certainly can contemplate what effect they may have on a deal like this acquisition that we just announced. Having said all of that, we believe scale matters in all of our businesses, and our ability to bring our sourcing power together with their demand, coupled with our existing demand, will only improve our ability to help our customers get the right products at the right price and continue to deliver great service to patients throughout those markets. So we're very optimistic on how this looks to us.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just switching over to the IT business, we saw the charge related to RCM this quarter. I was wondering, will there be -- sorry if I missed this, will there be another charge next quarter related to this? And then I guess more broadly, can you maybe talk about the outlook for Horizon Clinical and maybe the long-term impact this could have on the overall clinical franchise?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Let me start Robert. In terms of a charge, there maybe a couple million dollars that we incur in the March quarter, but all of that would be factored into both the EPS guidance I gave, as well as the comments I made about the margins for the full year that we expect in that segment. So we're, excluding this charge, pretty optimistic and certainly we took all the actions we did on these products, because we think it really positions us and our customers well for the long term.","John H. Hammergren","Turning to the Horizon Clinical question. And I guess just a clarification too, Robert, on revenue cycle management. We are no longer developing the Horizon platform of revenue cycle, our enterprise revenue cycle management, but the revenue cycle management business inside of McKesson is alive and well, both in the form of Paragon's revenue cycle and financial systems, but also Relay and other parts of our business provide revenue cycle tools that are very valuable to our customers. So the only business that we really shut down with this acquisition -- or excuse me, with this announcement was the development effort underway for Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. On the Horizon Clinical side, we have a lot of work to do to continue help our customers get through Meaningful Use 2 and Meaningful Use 3, to make sure our products are all contemporary with the regulatory requirements that are necessary, and we plan to continue to support that product vigorously through that phase. There are no announced plans nor internal plans to sunset the Horizon Clinical product lines. We believe our customers will continue to get great value and utility out of Horizon Clinicals. But we also believe, over time, they'll begin to look at some of the other products and applications that we have in addition to Horizon Clinical as alternatives.","Operator","From Lazard, we'll hear from Tom Gallucci.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","First one was just a quick one on Katz. You already own some banner sort of franchises. Can you just describe the competitive landscape, will existing ones see this as an increasingly competitive move internally? Or how do you view that issue?","John H. Hammergren","Well we run over -- we're involved in over 600 banners in the country -- in the country of Canada now, but they're largely outside of the area where the Katz -- in fact, I think entirely outside of the Katz, where the Katz stores reside. So there isn't a lot of competitive overlap. Furthermore, there's probably more interest from our existing banners to see the benefit of a larger scale banner operation run by McKesson in Canada. So I think we will -- Katz has not experienced much attrition of their banners over time. They've had a great deal of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and we believe that loyalty will not only remain in place for us but perhaps even improve as we go forward. And we should be attracting more people into our banners across Canada over time because of that value we deliver.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, obviously there's been a lot of speculation, in the investment community any way, on potential customer churn and bringing generics in-house or not by various customers, just wanted to give you the opportunity for you to comment on -- on are there any customer specifically or the competitive landscape generally as you see it.","John H. Hammergren","Any year that goes by, there's always a few ins and outs in the customer base. And we clearly want to retain as many as we can, but we're also not unrealistic and know that occasionally, for whatever reason, we will win or lose a customer. We have a view, I think, that the market remains competitive but stable, and our sales forces are always out there trying to make sure that we're moving up the value chain with our customers, improving their performance and getting them to realize that through McKesson's service, they're getting a great result. Clearly as we did -- we began this year, I believe, we focused on expanding our operating margin in the 200 to 250 basis point range. We gave that guidance because we believed the markets will remain competitive and stable and that we would be able to drive value through the mix of business that we're selling to our customers, and through the efficiencies we can run on our operations. So we made -- we remain very focused on those objectives, expanding our margins, and that objective would not be attainable should we enter into a price-oriented sale into our marketplace. As it relates to generics in-house versus out of house, clearly we're always focused on helping our customers do a better job of buying products. We hope that their #1 choice of supply will come through us, and we have to earn that privilege. But frankly, none of our contracts acquire 100% use of McKesson from a generic sourcing perspective. And we do have specific contract terms with all of our customers when we set our pricing that lays out our expectations, and our customers meet the expectations as we've laid them out in our contracts. So we really don't leave this as an open-end question, Tom. It's a very thoughtful process, and we, as part of our discussions with our customers, when these contracts are put in place, we anticipate their desire to perhaps move in and out of the generic business a little bit on their own. But it really is, I think, the larger scale movement that we've noticed is our customers coming more to McKesson for generics en masse as opposed to leaving McKesson from the generics perspective.","Operator","And next is Glen Santangelo, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. Please check your mute function.","Operator","Up Next is Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two clarifications and a question really, if I could. Katz, are you saying $0.10 to $0.20 accretive to adjusted earnings for fiscal '13? And if so, that's about a $35 million swing factor, what would cause a variation to get to the high and low end? And then a quick follow-up on Horizon.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well Larry, what we're really saying is $0.10 to $0.20 in the first 12 months after it closes. We're anxious. We think this is a very straightforward transaction from a regulatory perspective, and we're hopeful to get it closed quickly. What we put in the press release, you'll note is, an expectation it certainly will get closed sometime during the first half of the calendar year. As to what would provide that big a swing, look, we haven't even closed the transaction. We haven't given guidance for FY '13. You're quite correct that we'll be able to narrow the range as each of those 2 things happen, but we're just trying to give people an initial feel for the magnitude of this transaction.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the $42 million for Horizon Enterprise, $20 million of that is cash expense. Could you elaborate on what those are? And is that -- any sort of guide of what we could think about in terms of ongoing cost savings now that you're not going to be supporting the specific development of Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management going forward?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes. I don't think I quite broke it out cash, non-cash, but you are correct that there's $22 million of writing stuff off on the balance sheet, mostly prepaid licenses, those sorts of things. A little bit of capitalized software. And you had $6 million of severance, because as John pointed out in his remark, the one place where we did shut something down is we have stopped development on the Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management platform. Some of those folks have been very usefully redeployed on our expanded development efforts on Paragon, and we certainly continue to develop the Horizon Clinical product. But there's some net savings from that severance. And then the other charge was for the modest number of Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management customers where we had contracts in place. We've clearly reached agreement with those customers on how we're going to proceed with them going forward.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And finally, just I know you've shown a very consistent rate of growth over a long period of time, I guess the 10-plus years that you have been CEO John, and for fiscal '13, communicating some potential accretion with Katz. But I know you're going to guide in May, but are there any other big puts and takes we should think about at this point of the year as we think about fiscal '13?","John H. Hammergren","Yes. As you said, it's probably a little early for us to think about fiscal '13. There are some headwinds and tailwinds as we think about that timeline. Clearly oral generics are going to be a positive, and the whole industry is expecting that. At the same time, we'll probably have a little bit of a headwind from a specialty generic perspective particularly on a year-over-year kind of compare. We believe that the balance sheet will continue provide significant opportunity for us going forward in our portfolio approach. Having said that, we also are going to probably face a little bit of a headwind from the VA contract, which as you know is 8 years old, and if we're fortunate enough to renew it, it will provide a little bit of a headwind even renewing it. But having said all of that, I think that we feel we're very well positioned in our industry, demographic support, the growth of our businesses, and I think we will continue to see good results out of our company.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","The only thing I'd add, Larry is as we've talked about in the past, some of the regulatory pricing step-downs in Canada, there's one further step-down and that will create a little modest headwind for us next year as well.","Operator","Up next, we'll hear from Steven Valiquette, UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Another question here on the Katz Group. I think at one point in last year, I think they were testing that self-distribution model. I think it was ultimately terminated. But I'm just curious if the prospect of Katz moving to this self-distribution model. Does that play any role in this acquisition? Or does it really have nothing to do with it?","John H. Hammergren","Yes. I don't believe it had anything to do with it -- at least from our perspective, I don't know what the Katz Group had contemplated in that process. But we had already renewed the Katz agreement for both their corporate stores and these banners prior to us really entering into any significant dialogue about what they might do with their banner operations. And I think the corporate store agreement that's going forward hasn't been really materially impacted as a result of this arrangement.","Operator","Our next question today will be from Charles Rhyee, Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the Provider Technologies segment here. First off, Jeff, you said that for the full year, if we ignore the charge for the realignment plan for the full year, we're going to come into the middle of the range. That kind of suggests maybe a sequential downtick in the margin. Is there anything particular in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well I think at least as I do the math, Charles, depending on whether you're towards the high end of the midpoint or low end of the midpoint, you don't necessarily go down sequentially. We're not trying to telegraph anything about the March quarter and don't particularly expect it to be down sequentially. We have had a pretty good year in MTS. And so it probably is less March quarter-loaded than the history of that business might suggest. The other thing, if you've heard us talk about over time, is as the transaction processing and payer-facing businesses in that segment have continued to grow and become a larger portion of the total earnings, those tend to be businesses that are pretty steady quarter-to-quarter and it's really the hospital software business that historically has been pretty March-loaded. So you put all that together, and we really have a much more even flow of earnings, excluding the charge across the year, and we're not trying to signal anything other than that.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a clarification, when you're talking about the realignment plan and you're here calling very specifically that it's really stopping development on Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, but at the same time if I recall, there was an earlier interview on -- that was in print, and I think it was with Dave talking about sort of the strategic roadmap here and offering the option for clients to go to Paragon. For Horizon clients on Clinicals that choose to go to Paragon, is this considered just a switchover that's counted within maintenance? Or would they have to repurchase the Paragon suite?","John H. Hammergren","Well I think that the simple answer is it depends. Each customer is really working with us on a specific plan. If they want to move to the Paragon product line, our role is to make sure that they feel good about a transition like that, and that they -- in the end of the discussion, get more. And when they get more functionality and lower cost of ownership, they're even more satisfied with McKesson. So I think that each relationship will take on a different tenor. I think there are some customers already that have already said to us, \"You know what, this is good news from our perspective. We like the Paragon platform. We understand what you're trying to do with it from a development perspective, and we think it will position us very well when we think out to 2020 for the kinds of demands we're going to have around medical home and accountable care and other things we have to do that the existing marketplace products really won't deliver for us.\" And so those folks are already in in-depth discussions. But having been involved in some of them, there are no 2 alike, because there's no really 2 customer footprint that's identical to another. So I would say the most important takeaway from this is that we're doing everything we can to make sure that our customers are making the right decision for them at the right time, and this is just another alternative for them to evaluate, particularly if they're already on the Horizon platform that they have this as an option. We're not going to force them to evaluate it right now. We're not going to force them to make any changes until they're ready.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And if I could just add one quick last follow-up here. As we think about the next phase of this space. I mean it sounds like you're -- with this development and focus on integrated sort of clinical to financial offering, also in conjunction with your sort of -- I mean the development on the Horizon ERM by itself. I mean is it really the next sort of phase of this industry that we'll be moving to a clinical sort of fully integrated platform that clients are looking for?","John H. Hammergren","Well we think there'll be 3 things they're going to have to focus on. Certainly one is the integration of clinical and financial records and the sort of a longitudinal view of the patient, both inpatient and outpatient. The second is going to be cost of ownership. And frankly, most of our provider customers are under tremendous pressure to reduce cost, and we believe that the Paragon platform, in particular, will provide a very low cost solution for our customers over time. And the third element that most of them are beginning now to come to grips with are probably 2 dual functions. One is the web enablement of products, the ability to have sort of access anywhere, anytime to the data they need from a myriad of sources whether they're payer sources or whether they're retail pharmacy sources or consumer-related connectivity. And the second dimension is the analytics on the data that they're getting access to. So we're investing heavily in both sort of the web strategy, the connectivity strategy, as you've heard us talk about with Relay and you've also heard us talking about advanced analytics as a component part. So product that's fully functioning, integrated single data view of the patient, low cost of ownership and increasingly flexible enough to integrate with the other constituents in healthcare realtime in a web friendly kind of Software-as-a-Service way, as well as this analytic engine.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Up next we'll take Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe on the generic pricing front, any updated thoughts sort of on the level of inflation we're sort of seeing and whether there's been any sort of change to the trend we've seen over the last couple of quarters?","John H. Hammergren","I don't think we've seen any significant trend changes. The price performance of generics is largely in line with our expectations and relatively stable.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just quickly on the cap deployment front. I mean I saw you upsized, and Jeff you talked about the buyback. And we've obviously -- I think it's been 2 straight quarters where we've had little activity, and it makes sense given the M&A. Is sort of the signal here or at least maybe later in this year as we turn into your fiscal '13 given the size of the remaining buyback, we'll start to see that sort of activity pick up again?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, Ross, you know that we never comment on share buyback we're planning to do. I would just make or reiterate maybe the couple observations I made in the script. And that if you look at our domestic cash balance, it was a little over $2 billion. And we probably need in our domestic system, let's call it, $750 million or so. So there's a significant level of excess cash, which as you point out, has been sitting there for a while, and we don't try to every quarter sweep our balance sheet down to the absolute minimum cash balance level. On the other hand, we don't have a plan to forever sit on cash. You should expect to see us in the relative near to medium term deploy significant amount of domestic cash. And what you see from our board's action is we now have the flexibility, if the best way to do that is through share repurchase, to do that.","Operator","Lisa Gill of JP Morgan has the next question.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John and Jeff, my first question would just be around your direct drug distribution revenue. John I mean up 7% is clearly better than what we're seeing anywhere else across the channel. Can you maybe talk about -- is it specific customers? Are your customers buying more product from you? How should we think about this and also think about it on a go-forward basis?","John H. Hammergren","Well we're clearly pleased with our revenue performance, Lisa. And I think it really is sort of strength across the board with our customers. I wouldn't want to forecast off of that kind of revenue growth, but I do believe that we're just experiencing a byproduct of our customers' continued success. We did -- on the indirect or warehouse revenue line, we did pick up an incremental customer there that's added to that strength.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up, John, on the VA contract. I understand there'll be a hearing on Wednesday. Any thoughts around what they're looking at as they look at the overall private vendor contract? And any thoughts as to what potentially could come out of this hearing on Wednesday?","John H. Hammergren","Well we are aware of the hearing, and we'll actually be participating in the hearing. We are proud of the service we've provided to the VA and the kind of savings we provided. We clearly -- I know there's been questions raised about certain elements of the way the VA has executed their activity under our agreement, and we continue to participate as asked in the discussions that are underway. We don't believe it will have any impact on their consideration of us as a potential awardee of this contract that's coming up in May.","Operator","Citi's George Hill has the next question.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick comment, I must not be getting north of the border too much because we call them Katz down here as opposed to Katz. Just on, circling back on the IT business for a second, is there any chance you'll be willing to quantify for us potentially the revenue at risk or the value at risk if we think of how much revenue is tied to the legacy Horizon Revenue Management base?","John H. Hammergren","Well we'd like to think that none of our revenue base in Horizon is at risk because we've committed to our customers to get them through the most important aspects associated with their near-term priority and that's Meaningful Use 2, Meaningful Use 3 and clearly some ICD-10 work that's going on in many of our product lines. Our commitment to their satisfaction and to them accomplishing their objectives is unwavering, and this announcement only affected a small subgroup of our customers that were developing strategies to implement Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Clearly those handful of customers we had to go to and have a conversation about the fact the product that they had ordered at had an interest in ordering is not going to be available, and their alternative would be to return to the STAR platforms, that many of them are on -- or stay on STAR, or consider the Paragon financial strategy. As it relates to Horizon Clinical customers, clearly there are some that are asking questions about whether they should stay on Horizon, whether they should go to Paragon or whether they should consider going to an alternative. I think the number of customers that are in that bucket probably, although it may not be the same names, probably hasn't changed an awful lot since we announced the Paragon strategy. And so we -- as you know, we've had some challenges with the Horizon Clinical implementations. We believe that we've made significant progress now. And to a large extent, the history of the product is overshadowed by our current success with the product. Having said that, clearly we always have customers that might be considering alternatives. But our goal here for that small set of customers that are considering an alternative is to give them one more, which is to move to Paragon, because we believe Paragon, for some of our customers, will be a nice choice, particularly if they believe Horizon isn't meeting their needs.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great color, John. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just remind me, if I'm remembering kind of the product roll-up right. So it was HealthQuest, STAR and Series that rolled up under the Horizon banner, and then Paragon was part of the acquired product that went in that direction?","John H. Hammergren","Well HealthQuest, Series and STAR were actually older brands that were acquired, or companies. And those products had remained and do remain largely unchanged, however, always updated for certain functionality and regulatory compliance. The Horizon financial product was a brand-new product that had, had no basis from an acquisition perspective. And the Horizon Clinical product line was not built off of the STAR, HealthQuest or Series platforms. It was a lot of internal development, as well as some acquisitions on the outside. So I think Horizon Clinicals and Horizon Financials were 2 different strategies from a product architecture perspective coming together later. And there's one other nuance that our customers and our shareholders should understand is that we use the Horizon name perhaps more liberally than just on the clinical products. You might recall that we acquired a medical imaging product that's leading in the industry from a company called A.L.I. that has been part of McKesson now for a long time. That's actually called Horizon Medical Imaging, for example, and that product line is on a Microsoft platform. It will not be touched by the changes we've just announced with Horizon Clinicals. So the Horizon name is used in the business as a branding tool, but it isn't necessarily accurate as it relates to architectural decisions or other decisions that might be made with the product.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Up next is Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So 2 follow-ups here. One on the potential headwind from the VA contract before we renew it in fiscal year '13. Should we think about the Katz acquisition as kind of like filling in that void if you achieve the upper end of the guidance range for the acquisition?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Ricky, I guess I don't see any relationship. We have a long track record of using our portfolio approach to capital deployment to make, what, everything smooths [ph], makes sense strategically and financially, and that's what Katz is. The VA is obviously a unique situation given the unique nature of the bidding process, and we'll just have to see how that comes out. But I wouldn't, in any way, tie the 2 together.","John H. Hammergren","I would say though, Ricky, our goal obviously is to grow our company and to grow it profitably and to deploy our capital intelligently. Those are not in conflict with our strategy with the VA contract, and I would say they're 2 parallel paths headed in the same direction, which is a high-performing company doing the right thing for our customers and our shareholders. But certainly we would have pursued the Katz acquisition sort of regardless of what happens with the VA, and we'll pursue the VA regardless of the fact that we acquired Katz. And so I think that's the point we're trying to make.","Operator","And Raymond James' John Ransom is up next.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","How are you guys thinking about the AMP effect that apparently is going to go in effect in 2013 both in terms of the Medicaid reductions number of [indiscernible] potential transparency it brings to generic [indiscernible] and the effect on margins?","John H. Hammergren","Well the AMP stands for average manufacturer prices, this is an activity our government has been pursuing for some time as it relates to the way they reimburse purchases to our customers. So it really is not something that would directly affect wholesaling in our country, and I think that we are continuing to study what's going on with AMP just like everyone else in the pharmaceutical business. And I don't -- other than the fact that we're always trying to optimize the performance of our customers and to make sure that they're being well compensated for the service they provide, our interest in AMP is more of an observer.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Eric Coldwell, Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","If you could, could you tell me what the average revenue for an independent pharmacy in Canada is, just big picture?","John H. Hammergren","I'm sorry could you repeat that question?","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. The average revenue for an independent pharmacy in Canada, is it in the ballpark of $2 million, thereabout?","John H. Hammergren","Yes. I don't know. It's probably in the $2 million to $3 million kind of range. I'm just guessing based on these numbers. But Jeff, do you have...","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes. There is a wider range than that. So we have stores that are even a little under $1 million up to that $3 million range. But it depends a little bit on how you define independent as well.","John H. Hammergren","And how you define average. ","Thank you very much for your questions today. I want to thank you all for getting on the call. I'm certainly pleased with our year-to-date performance, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm now going to had the call off to Ana for her review of upcoming events for the financial community.","Ana Schrank","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On February 8, we will present at the UBS Healthcare Services conference in New York. On May 8, we will present at the Deutsche Bank Healthcare conference in Boston.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead sir.","Craig Mercer","Thank you, Ciciliya. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson\u2019s fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt\u2019s comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end to call promptly after one hour at 9:00 AM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance and we have raised and narrowed fiscal 2018 guidance range of $11.80 to $12.50, to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80, driven by a lower tax rate and lower share count. First the third quarter we generated total company revenues of more than $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.41. ","Before I delve into the details of the quarter let me briefly touch on a couple of recent developments. We are excited to have just closed the acquisition of RxCrossroads. We are committed to broadening and deepening our portfolio of solutions and services to better serve our pharmaceutical and biotechnology or biopharma manufacturer partners\u2019 needs. Our vision is to be the partner of choice across the product life cycle by creating a comprehensive, best-in-class, differentiated set of services. RxCrossroads expands and improves our existing services and third-party logistics, reimbursement access and health and pharmacy solutions. It also compliments our offerings to include upstream plasma logistics and specialized field support.","The integration of this business with our existing biopharma facing solutions will enhance our ability to provide turnkey solutions for our manufacturer partners. To assure patients get access to innovative therapies to enable rapid market penetration of products and help manufactures create value. And for payers, we can provide evidence in a value-based way to highlight the best solutions for the patients they server. In summary, we have a unique set of capabilities that bring a superior value proposition to our bio pharma partners.","In the third quarter we made the decision to bring the capabilities of our Specialty Health and businesses under Nick Loporcaro\u2019s strong leadership, which will allow us to more closely coordinate and optimize how we provide service and solutions to our manufacturer and provider partners across the health care landscape. Many of you have met Nick at prior Investor Day events. He brings extensive experience to leadership positions he has held at McKesson Canada and McKesson Specialty Health.","As some of you may recall when we were beginning to build our specialty franchise more than a decade ago, we made the decision to carve out these assets from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in order to incubate high growth opportunity to maturity. Now that our specialty franchise is well established and a leader in the market, a decision to combine Specialty Health and U.S. Pharmaceutical under Nick\u2019s leadership is a natural next step in the evolution of these businesses.","And for retail pharmacy customers with our recent acquisition of acquisition of Well.ca, we have strengthened our ecommerce capabilities hopping to provide an omni-channel presence in serving our customers in a way that works for them. In addition to leveraging digital capabilities, our suite of retail pharmacy services extends beyond simply filling the prescription. For instance, we connect the patient digitally with the pharmacists for medication education, treatment protocols and medicine scheduling reminders, which drive adherence across our global retail footprint.","Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 7% on a constant currency basis.","I'd like to discuss a few highlights in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health. The business is now headed by Nick. I'm extremely pleased with the progress of ClarusONE and its strong contribution to our results this year. We have contracted a diverse range of manufacturers delivering benefits to our partner Walmart and more broadly, with all of our customers who purchase generics through us, helping them to be more successful in a competitive and dynamic market.","Next we continue to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, as they work through our contract renewal cycles. We are pleased with the results and remain focused on receiving fair compensation for the services we provide for each drug category.","Finally, we are working closely with Rite to ensure the successful transition of the allotted stores to Wallgreen. We continue to deliver exceptional value to Rite every day and we remain comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability has not been \u2013 will be impacted by this transition.","In addition to my earlier comments on the RxCrossroads\u2019 acquisition, and the breadth of our capabilities we are building and the support of biopharma companies, the intraFUSION acquisition enhances our muti-specialty footprint with the focus on neurology and rheumatology. I\u2019m happy to report that the team is executing the integration plan and we are doing well relative to the business case.","Additionally, the BDI Pharma business we acquired last quarter is a solid compliment to our existing plasma offering that allows us to expand plasma and biologics distributions into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise. We\u2019re also pleased with the progress on integrating this transaction.","I\u2019ll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations as we passed the one year mark, following our acquisition of Rexall. We\u2019re also encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making on integrating and executing against the business cases of our Uniprix and GMD Distribution acquisitions.","Before I move on, I wanted to comment on the recently announced generic price initiative by the Canadian Provincial Government. The initiative, which is effect of April 1, 2018, will reduce the pricing of approximately 70 commonly used generic drugs. We have a broad range of businesses in Canada which are growing strongly. While certain of our businesses will be affected by this initiative, we are evaluating the economic impact of these reductions. We are engaged in the dialogue with the governments around ensuring fair compensation for the wholesale and retail services we provide to drive better health.","And within our prescription, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, which has demonstrated excellent revenue growth, CoverMyMeds is honored with Frost & Sullivan's 2017 North American Visionary Innovation Leadership Award, recognizing our prior authorization solutions. While this award highlights the innovation and solutions we bring to the market, more important it demonstrates how we deliver value to pharmacists, manufactures, providers and payors.","Turning now to our results for International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, we made progress on addressing the challenges facing our UK retail business that we announced in conjunction with our second quarter results. We are actively in the process of either closing or selling approximately 200 retail pharmacy locations. Although we have concerns with the current UK reimbursement environment, we remain committed to supporting our pharmacy customers. We do this by making it easier for patients to get what they need, whether they are through services like Click and Collect, Lloyds Online Doctor or the ability to consult with a pharmacist when you visit a store. Additionally, we collect data and provide analytics which helps retail pharmacies manage individual patients, drive adherence and deliver better health outcomes.","When we put these assets together, it demonstrates how our investments provide pharmacies with a comprehensive offering to reduce time and administrative activities, while improving the focus on patient care.","And finally, our medical surgical business continues to be one of the fastest growing businesses in our portfolio, reflecting strong market growth, including the benefits from a shift to lower class sites of care. We continue to expand our services to medical surgical manufactures. I\u2019ll highlight our success in the last business where we serve as a sales team for certain manufactures that focus on the physician and community hospital labs. This is a great example of the unique value we will bring to the manufacturers for expanding the range of services our customers can provide to diagnose and treat patients for a variety of clinical conditions. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with how our Distribution Solutions segment preformed in the third quarter. ","Turning briefly to our Technology Solutions segment, beginning with this quarter, this segment consist solely of our 70% equity investment in Change Healthcare following the successful sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in early October. We continue to see progress against the execution of the business case and a realization of the anticipated cost synergies.","Next let me take a moment to provide our perspective on the recently enacted federal tax reform. We\u2019re a supporter of the tax reform and believe that it will allow U.S. companies to make new investments and to improve their competitive position. Our complex, and scope and nature we recognized a net benefit from the tax changes. Any cash realized from the reform will be deployed using our portfolio approach with the goal of delivering value for our shareholders through mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. ","In addition, we expect Change Healthcare to benefit from the recently enacted tax reform, given it is predominantly a U.S. focused business. Britt will provide you with more detail on the impact of tax reform.","And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal third quarter results represented continued execution across the enterprise, and we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 from $11.80 to $12.50 to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share.","Before I turn the call over to Britt Vitalone, our new CFO, I want to take a moment to thank James Beer for his contributions. I appreciate the support over the past four years. Some of you have already met Britt and know his background. But for those of you who don't, I'm happy to share some details with you.","During his 12-year tenure with McKesson, Britt has led the corporate FDA and M&A finance functions, was CFO of our Medical-Surgical business and most recently served as CFO of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health businesses. He also has deep operational experience, which included the creation of the ClarusONE joint sourcing venture, which is delivering material generic sourcing benefits. While I'm pleased to have worked alongside James Beer over the last four years, our ability to immediately name a successor reflects our deep bench of talent. I look forward to continuing to work with Britt in his new role.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?","Britt Vitalone","Good morning. And thank you for your kind remarks, John. As this marks the first time I'm addressing our investment community on an earnings call, I want to take a moment to make a few opening remarks. I'd also like to start by thanking James Beer for his leadership over the past four years. He's had a tremendous impact on the company, and I've enjoyed working closely with him. I wish James all the best.","I've been in the role a few weeks now, and I'm excited about the opportunities have in front of us, and the opportunity to serve as McKesson CFO. I look forward to working with our investors and the analyst community.","Finally, I'm going to briefly mention our current segment reporting. With Paul Julian's retirement as of the beginning of the calendar year, we are currently evaluating our operating structure. I anticipate that this review will result in a change to our existing segment reporting structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We'll provide an update and additional details on our fourth quarter earnings call in May.","Turning now to the results of our fiscal third quarter. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.41, reflecting solid operating results, a lower tax rate driven in part by discrete tax benefits and a lower share count. And as a result of a lower tax rate and lower share count, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $12.50 to 12.80 per diluted share.","Let me start with a review of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We believe the new tax law is positive for business and for McKesson. As noted in our press release this morning, our third quarter GAAP results reflect material benefit stemming from the tax act. Both McKesson and Change Healthcare recorded net benefits related to the tax act in the third quarter. These nonrecurring benefits are excluded from our adjusted earnings.","In December, McKesson recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $370 million, which contributed $1.78 to our third quarter GAAP EPS. This net tax benefit results primarily to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities, principally related to LIFO due to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the impact of transition taxes and foreign retained earnings. In addition, Change Health recorded a net benefit, driven primarily by the re-measurement of its deferred tax liabilities at a lower tax rate.","McKesson's 70% equity interest of that benefit is expected to be approximately $70 million to $110 million, which will be reflected in the equity investment in Change Healthcare line. However, given the 1-month lag in McKesson's reporting of our equity share of Change Healthcare, that benefit will be reflected in our fourth quarter GAAP results.","Next, let me discuss the impact of federal tax reform on our adjusted earnings. For McKesson, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a lower rate driven by the new U.S. federal tax rate. We expect a tax run rate range of 22% to 24% driven by our mix of business. That said, each fiscal year's tax rate may be impacted by its pre-tax charges or benefits during the year from items, such as tax planning initiatives and examinations of our tax returns by the tax authorities. We anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%. I would remind you that are anticipated fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate has been positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That P&L benefit is expected to end at the close of fiscal 2018 driven by a change income tax accounting rules.","To summarize, we expect our fiscal 2019 adjusted tax rate to be above our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate, driven the by lapping of discrete tax items and the full year benefit related to software amortization realized in fiscal 2018. We'll provide an update on adjusted tax rates for fiscal 2019 and will provide guidance in May.","For Change Healthcare, as I previously mentioned, we report these results in a one-month lag. And as a result, their fourth quarter will include the effects of the lower run rate for two months of Change Healthcare results. Specific to fiscal 2019, we'll provide additional insight on McKesson's expected adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare when we provide guidance in May.","Finally, as a result of the tax act, we anticipate modestly favorable cash flows over time. We expect to deploy these favorable cash flows in line with our portfolio approach to capital deployment. While some of the items I've just discussed have an immediate impact, there are certain items within tax reform in which companies have up to a year to finalize. As such, we may have true-up's in future quarters. In our 10-Q we filed later today, you'll find additional information about the impact of federal tax reform and the provisional amounts recorded in the quarter.","Now let me turn to financial results for fiscal third quarter. The results that I provide this morning will be on an adjusted basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. We provided a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and our 8-K filed this morning.","As a reminder, our adjusted earnings exclude the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments.","Starting now with a review of our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. For the third quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2% from a year ago, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted other income was $22 million for the quarter. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $55 million for the third quarter, which was adversely impacted by a lower-than-expected contribution in Change Healthcare's imaging business due to deferrals of customer purchases. We now expect adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture to be in a range of $265 million to $295 million in fiscal 2018.","Interest expense of $67 million, decreased 9% for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 11.5%, driven by discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million in the quarter, which primarily relates to the conclusion of certain tax audits. We now anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%, down from approximately 24%, driven in roughly equal parts by our expected mix of business, lower adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter and the discrete tax benefits recognized in the third quarter.","Income attributable to noncontrolling interests, or NCI, was $58 million for the quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year increase in NCI is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, our joint sourcing entity with Walmart","Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $712 million, with third quarter adjusted EPS at $3.41, which is up 12% compared to $3.04 in the prior year. Third quarter year-over-year adjusted EPS growth was primarily driven by a lower share count, organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, incremental profit contribution from acquisition and a lower tax rate, which included discrete tax benefits, which are unrelated to tax reform. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower profit driven by the contribution of the majority of the Technology Solutions businesses of Change Healthcare, the sale of our EIS business and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $208 million down 6% compared the prior year.","Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $53.6. Revenues benefited from $663 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues increased 7%, year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8%, driven by market growth and acquisitions partially offset by brand to generic conversion.","International pharmaceutical distribution resources revenues were $7 billion this quarter. Revenues benefited from $530 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Our UK team continues to make progress in the retail pharmacy initiatives we outlined on our second quarter earnings call. To date, we've identified approximately 200 store closures and divestitures, which approximately 90 stores are expected to be divested. We continue to expect meaningful savings from this program in fiscal 2019.","And finally, Medical-Surgical revenues increased 9%, for the third quarter driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted profit was up 20% for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, partially offset by the impact of reduce reimbursement in our U. K. retail pharmacy business.","Brand compensation for the third quarter was in line with expectation. Additionally, January brand manufacturer pricing activity was in line with our expectation, and we continue to see results slightly above our full year assumption of mid single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. I would point out that while the overall brand inflation rate is important, it is less important in prior years as we continue to evolve our brand compensation arrangements, reduce the variability from branded inflation. As it relates to the generic market environment, generic deflation on the buy side continues to be in line with our expectation.","The sell-side pricing environment remains competitive yet less volatile than the year-ago period. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% for the quarter. Segment operating expenses required an increase driven by acquisitions and the mix of retail business, partially offset by an ongoing cost management output. ","As a reminder, in fiscal 2018, our year-over-year growth for adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses are impacted by the shift of business in the segment, including our larger owned retail footprint and technology businesses. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit increased 23% to $991 million, driven by the same factors as previously discussed. In constant currency, segment adjusted operating profit $982 million.","As a remainder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the McKesson's adjusted operating profit was negatively impacted by two nonrecurring charges showing approximately $60 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate was 185 basis points an increase of 22 basis points. The adjusted margin rate was also impacted by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. Due to the mix shift, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be slightly below our original guidance range of between 198 basis points and 208 basis points.","McKesson recorded $109 million in adjusted corporate expenses for the third quarter. We now expect adjusted corporate expenses to be between approximately $410 million and $430 million in fiscal 2018.","I\u2019ll review our balance sheet metrics. Our receivables day\u2019s sales outstanding decreased one day from the prior year to 27 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day from the prior years to 30 days. Days sales in payables decreased one day from the prior year to 58 days. It's important to point out that our working capital metrics may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion and to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to efficiently deploy capital. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repaid $545 million in long term debt and we spend $392 million on internal capital investments. We now expect property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be below the previously guided range between $650 million and $750 million. And we spend $2 billion on seven acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.","In the third quarter, we repurchased $250 million in common stock. Share repurchases during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 totaled $900 million. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $210 million for the full year. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share.","Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. As mentioned earlier, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings from a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share to a new range from $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share. As a remainder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook exclude the following items.","Amortization, acquisition related to tangible of $2.35 to $2.65 per diluted share, acquisition related expenses and adjustments of $1 to $1.20 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.05 \u2013 credits of $0.05 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.05 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share and other net credits of $0.50 to $0.70 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise today, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release and on our first and second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings calls are being reiterated. We continue to expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year.","In closing, our third quarter results were operationally in line with our expectations, and we're pleased to be able to raise our fiscal 2018 outlook to reflect the lower tax rate and share count. We are well positioned for a strong finish to fiscal 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of I\u2019d ask to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Pease.","Glen Santangelo","Hi, thanks and good morning. Hey Britt I just want to sort of follow-up on the comments you just made about the operating profit assumptions within the Distribution Solutions segment. I think you sort of suggest that you now expect to come in slightly below the range, and I'm just kind of \u2013 could you give us a little bit more color? Because it kind of sounds like price inflation is sort of in line with what you thought, maybe a little better. Generic deflation is kind of what you thought. We're not seeing any sort of strange activity in terms of the competitive landscape. So could you maybe just landscape. So could you maybe just give us a little bit more color? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. Yes, we did note here that we're going to be at the low end or slightly below the range. And I would attribute the to mix. As we talked about from quarter-to-quarter, we have a variety of mix between both products and customers, and I think that's really driving that comment. As we noted, it was an in-line quarter, but I would just point out to the mix of both product and customers.","Glen Santangelo","Maybe I could just ask one follow-up. John, you talked about differential pricing, and you're sort of going through repricing all your contracts sort of one by one. Any sort of takeaways from those repricings? Any impact on the margin that sort of worth calling out as we look on a go-forward basis? ","John Hammergren","Well thanks for the question Glen. Clearly, we've talked about the importance of our work in this area. And I think our customers clearly understand that the mix changes going on in our industry is more and more as these specialty products are coming to the marketplace.","And so I think in the short term, it has little impact on us or our customers, but as we reposition in advance of what we see is a cycle of a lot of specialty product, into the marketplace, we think these adjustments are appropriate for us. And frankly provide better line of sight to our customers related to all these products flow through the supply chain. So we're making good progress, and we would expect to be complete with this, as you noted, these final contracts renew in the last section of this work.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much and good morning. Let me start on the drug pricing side. Clearly, there are still a lot of debate in Washington around drug pricing, Trump coming out the other night and talking about it. John, can you talk about how you expected to impact your business going forward. You talk about stabilization here. You know talking about mid-single digits, what are the things that you potentially could see? I know you spent some time in DC, so let me start there and then I just had a follow-up as well.","John Hammergren","Well, I think you can break the drug pricing discussion into probably three large categories. Clearly, we continue to believe generic pricing and the related deflation we've experienced recently in that marketplace makes a generic product price very competitive. And certainly, as a percent of the total spend in health care, the price for these kinds of drugs or the treatment cost for patients continues to drop. And we think that, that phenomenon some of the pressure off the drug spend debate in this country and clearly, providing people with continued drug benefits also helps diffuse this. And for many folks that are on these drugs, the cost is somewhat immaterial to them on an annual basis.","On the branded drugs, you've seen a significant drop in inflation, if you think about the trend in that indicator over the last several years. And likewise, we think that the level of brand inflation that we have now is acceptable and defendable by these companies as they continue to use the remaining product they have under patent to fund their increased R&D work. And the last category I'd point out is \u2013 are some of these new specialty drugs.","And clearly, these drugs can be expensive, but, once again, when pressed, I think there's easy arguments to be made for how the use of these drugs and an analysis would show a decrease in the cost of health care for the patients that are on these treatments. And so in a value-based way, if people are thinking about health care spend and how to control it, I still think the use pharmaceuticals is the first and best place to go and get people on their treatments, get them to stay on them and adhere to the treatment and stay out of the hospitals.","Lisa Gill","So even though \u2013 the rhetoric is still there, and from your perspective, it doesn't sound like things have really changed from what they were one year ago. Is that the right way to think about it?","John Hammergren","Well, you obviously have continued to see deflation in the generic side, and like I said, we've seen a significant reduction in the amount inflation on the brand side. And I think the area that continues to get some scrutiny are some of these specialty drugs that have a small population that are very expensive to bring to the marketplace and a more value-oriented request as pharmaceutical companies price these to compare what the other treatment might have cost our society or a payer.","And so I think that there will be continued value-based discussions, but, frankly, I think the evidence will show that the spend on pharmaceuticals is an investment that's well made and one that pays a return compared to other alternatives. So I think, obviously, people that are in some of these categories, particularly the specialty categories, as a patient may find the debate interesting. But I think that as it relates to overall drug spend as a value, it continues to be one of the best values in health care today.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. And then, Britt, just going back to your comment about the mix and talking about specialty. But I'm just curious around flu and what the impact of flu will have in your projections for the fourth quarter. I generally think of that as being a little bit of a lower-margin product. Is that having any impact on the way you're thinking about the margins for the fourth quarter?","Britt Vitalone","I'd say that we've had a pretty strong flu season, I would say, as part of the product mix that I've talked about, along with specialty products. So that would be a part of the range that we provided you.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of questions here. John, you mentioned the changes in reimbursement in Canada. I'd just kind of like help to frame the potential impact. Can you just walk through kind of what would be the profit contribution of Canada overall? We have it at around 7% of EBITDA. And any additional color on how these reimbursement changes compare to what you've seen in the past? Because there have been periods in the past where we've seen these generic price initiatives, and you were able kind of like to manage through them.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Ricky, for the question. As you point out, the Canadian business is significant to McKesson and important and has continued to grow nicely. And in the past, we have been impacted negatively from reimbursement changes that have sort of rolled through various provinces at different periods in time. It's probably early to size the impact of these most recent changes or what work we might be able to do to find reimbursement channels for the services we provide in retail or wholesale from the government or other offsets that we might find in the business as we continue to grow in the wide variety of businesses that we are in, in the Canada market.","I would say the difference this time compared to the other types of reimbursement events is that this one is across all provinces, all at the same time, effective April 1, and not insignificant in its impact on that portion of our business, the generic business. So I think it's important for us to point it out. We'll talk about it more as we get into our guidance for next year and think about it as we work through the discussions we have with the Canadian government related to what services they want to reimburse us for, et cetera. So I think it's important, but it's something that we are used to, to the extent that we've had to deal with this in the past.","Ricky Goldwasser","And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the tax benefit and kind of like how you're thinking of investing back into the business, you talked about acquisitions, buybacks and dividends. But when you think about kind of like the capital initiatives, is there any kind of like way that you can help us kind of like think through it and quantify it as we're kind of like thinking about the pull-through to fiscal year 2019?","John Hammergren","Well, I think Britt has already outlined sort of his expectations from a tax rate perspective. We, I think, provided a range, and that should be helpful to you. As it relates to the use of the incremental cash produced by this very favorable tax law change, I think our comment was we will continue to follow a portfolio approach, and that's probably the most color I can provide you. You know that we do have a great track record of making intelligent acquisitions and not overpaying for them and doing a great job of integrating the acquisitions.","And so that continues to be one of our top priorities, but you also notice that we've done relatively significant share repurchases this year. And we will probably continue to use both of those, along with our dividends, as a strategy to grow. I do think that we are beginning an innovation phase at McKesson that we're excited about, that is more than just the M&A side of things. And so although acquisitions have played a role in the past, I think that we will find a way to provide innovation and opportunity to grow organically inside of McKesson, and that's some of the investment that we plan to make.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Tanquilut","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask a question on the ClarusONE comment. So how do we \u2013 how should we think about the remaining opportunity there in terms of either expanding the relationship with Walmart or expanding the client base and product lines? And what's your outlook on incremental margin opportunities with ClarusONE? Thanks.","John Hammergren","Well, thanks for the question. It's great to have Britt here at the table, given that he was the one that built ClarusONE and got it implemented on time and produced results that were not only at our expectations but perhaps beyond, and it's the same thing for our partners that have benefited. Britt, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the opportunities we see.","Britt Vitalone","Sure, John. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made at Clarus, and we're very pleased that our partner, Walmart, and our customers are benefiting from that. And we have quite a bit of opportunity as we go forward, whether that be geographic opportunities outside of the U.S. or as we look at other product opportunities. And certainly, we have those discussions with our partners all the time.","So we believe that we've really got a great foundation in place. We've been able to partner with a number of manufacturers and really develop a beachhead around generics in the U.S., and we think we have tremendous foundation to take that further, whether that be, again, additional geographies or additional product categories. So we are quite excited about the potential that we have there, and we'll continue to explore that over the coming quarters.","Brian Tanquilut","All right, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric Coldwell","Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Medical, I know it's not your biggest segment, but 9% growth is pretty impressive, especially on the heels of a peer's pre-announcement last night, realizing that there are channel differences. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more detail, parse out product categories that are growing quickly. Maybe talk about share capture or specific initiatives leading to this 9% growth rate. And then maybe give us a sense on how comfortable you are with that level of a growth rate going forward, if you are so. Thanks, John. Thanks very much.","John Hammergren","Thanks for the question and thanks for recognizing what we think is really outstanding performance in our Medical-Surgical business. We have built a tremendous asset there that has been entirely focused on growing with our customers as they grow outside of the acute care health care system. And whether it's large health systems that are buying physician practices or whether it's long-term care centers or home care, we think we're extremely well positioned. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expanding the product portfolio and the value that we deliver to our customers each day.","And an example would be bringing lab and diagnostic into the physician office space. The \u2013 increasingly, technology is allowing us to do things right then and there in the physician office with the patient. The patient gets immediate results. The physician gets immediate results. Treatment decisions can be made immediately. And all can happen in a way that delivers better value for the patient, better care for the patient and, clearly, improved economics for the physicians.","So there are several examples where we've extended our reach into these important markets, which expands our footprint. We've maintained and grown our business even through the acquisitions of doctors in the health systems market because of the value proposition that we deliver and our unique capabilities to service these disparate facilities in a low-cost, high-quality way, and we think the business is going to continue to grow. As mentioned earlier by Lisa, obviously, the flu market has been something that has also benefited us.","Albeit not as profitable, it's an important part of the value proposition both in retail as well as in the ambulatory or physician office setting. So we benefited from some tailwinds relative to flu season. But I think our focus on the business and our great people there has also enhanced our performance. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. Maybe, John, could you just give us a little bit more color on some of the more recent acquisitions or some of the new segments you've formed have kind of trended? It feels like you sort of did a number of deals that kind of aided your core growth rate and maybe also margins. So a little bit of color on some of those would be helpful. And then maybe a comment on sort of the RxCrossroads deal and sort of what that brings capability-wise to the organization.","John Hammergren","Well, thanks for the question, Ross. You've followed the company for a long time as well as some of your colleagues on this call. And if you watch what we do, it typically is arraying a set of assets in advance of opportunities fully materializing so that we can capitalize on the right strategic positions in advance of growth. We like things that are growing in an accretive way to the base. We like things that are providing margin opportunities that are accretive to our margin, and we like to be positioned in markets where the total available market is significant and where we believe it's going to grow rapidly and where we can win.","So whether you think about our movement into the generic marketplace or our movement into alternate-site Medical-Surgical, we try to think about a go-forward where the growth will be. Similarly, you've seen us array a set of assets beginning with OTN against the oncology business years ago, probably over a decade ago, than the acquisition of U.S. Oncology and a string of other things that have positioned us for the specialty market, the most recent being RxCrossroads, as you just mentioned.","So I think it is important for us to continue to grow our businesses and the value we can deliver to specialty manufacturers, not just in the supply chain but also in the ability for their product to be launched effectively, to be reimbursed effectively and quickly. And for the patient and the physicians and the pharmacies to be supported as these products are taken up by the patients is an important aspect of what we're trying to do.","And clearly, working on the revenue side of specialty pharma provides a lot of incremental value to our manufacturer partners. And so anything we can do to get the script in the appropriate hands of a patient and properly filled and taken and adhered to is delivering tremendous value to the patient to begin with, but also delivering tremendous value to our partners in the supply chain. So we're excited about the value proposition that we're creating.","Ross Muken","Thanks, John. And maybe a quick one for Britt, and welcome to the call. I guess, on just cash flow, a decent drain so far both year-to-date on working cap and deferred taxes. What is the updated view on sort of what the free cash number could kind of look at for the year? I am not sure I caught that.","Britt Vitalone","Yeah, I would say there is no change to our expectations on cash flow at this time. It's, as I mentioned in my remarks, it's \u2013 where the end of the quarter finishes in terms of the day also has a big impact, and it's not unusual to see us have a strong fourth quarter for cash flow, and so for that \u2013 those reasons, I would say that we're not changing our expectations on generating free cash flow for fiscal 2018.","Ross Muken","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Thanks for taking my question. John, just want to go back to the public focus on drug pricing. One of the recent initiatives that we saw was led by hospitals with this idea of building out their own generic drug company to drive better accessibility and drive down price, obviously, with specific generic drugs. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that initiative specifically, how you think it could impact the industry? And then maybe just more generally, kind of what you're hearing and seeing from your hospital customers around drug pricing.","John Hammergren","Well, I certainly read the announcement with some interest. We've been in the Generic business for a long time, and we've, obviously, built our NorthStar product line and great collaboration with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and delivered significant value back into the marketplace. I think that my interpretation of what's going on there is really related to availability, to a large extent; and to some extent, perhaps pricing. And probably those are two \u2013 those two things are tied together to some extent.","I'm not sure that another manufacturer will necessarily dramatically improve the availability. If it's a raw material-related issue or just a capacity-related issue. It's difficult to bring capacity on and it's, obviously, difficult to get through all of the regulatory challenges associated with standing up a brand-new company. Having said that, there may be opportunities for these large and important customers, some of which are ours to work in a collaborative way with others in the supply chain to avail themselves of better product availability or supply and certainly to take their buying power and aggregate it in a way that gives them some price leverage in the marketplace.","So we look forward to exploring opportunities, as you said, on these limited number of generic products that have been difficult to our customers and for the market and anything we can do to help them. I would say that I'm a little suspect of the ability to ground up a generic manufacturing company that's owned in a collaborative way and to compete with our largest generic manufacturing partners in a material way. I just don't see that as being a simple task.","Robert Jones","Yeah, understood. I guess just one quick follow up, John, with one quarter left in the fiscal year, I know you guys will be getting formal guidance at a later time. But any initial thoughts as you look out to next year as we think about the major drivers? You talked about branded, generic pricing, volumes. Anything that you would foresee kind of stable, down or up as we look out into fiscal 2019?","John Hammergren","Well, as we have said in the past, we go through periods in these markets that sometimes can be a little bit difficult to predict. But as we see it now at least, the markets remain competitive but relatively stable. We've, for a long time, dealt with a deflationary generic market with spots of inflation and the clearly those dynamics seem to have settled into a pattern flat that at least for the last few quarters, have been pretty similar in their compare. And I think the biggest change we see coming in front of us, as I mentioned earlier, is an innovation cycle, particularly in specialty drugs that will be important.","And the support of those manufacturers that need to get access to the product and access to the market, I should say and speed to delivery to the patient will be important. And I talked a little bit earlier about things that we try to do to make that simpler. CoverMyMeds will be another great example where we try to reduce the friction associated with getting somebody approved to begin to take one of these drugs in an automated prior authorization format. So that's the longer-term change I continue to see coming, which is a mix change into these more difficult to take \u2013 or difficult to pay for, difficult to get access to and difficult disease states that these new drugs are going to be marketed to.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from Needham. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Thanks, guys, a couple of questions. First, you've done a lot of acquisitions on the manufacturing services, specialty side. Is there any capabilities or verticals there that you don't have yet that you feel you might need to sort of provide everything you can possibly provide to the manufacturers?","John Hammergren","Well, clearly, there is all kinds of things that the manufacturers either do internally or are already sourcing from partners, and that list of activity is pretty long and significant and probably changing. We do think that the assets that we put together are important. It gives us important scale, it gives as existing customer relationships and it gives us a foundation in services that may not be entirely complete if you think packaging and outsourced manufacturing and some of those kinds of capabilities.","But we think that parts of the manufacturer requirement, particularly, as I said, on the revenue and adherence side, are important. And we believe that our focus in that direction has been an appropriate one, and we can benefit our partners as well as ourselves by being world-class in our ability to make that happen. So I think we remain disciplined and vigilant as it relates to opportunities, but I don't think we feel like we are at a disadvantage in terms of what we have today and we will be opportunistic to evaluate other alternatives that may come along.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay. And one question just on foreign exchange and the benefit. Is that \u2013 you mentioned it's $0.10 \u2013 you still expect it to be sort of a $0.10 impact to earnings this year. But is it \u2013 what does it do to the actual margin of the business? I'm guessing it's a negative impact to the margin overall then. As you look at the reconciliation\u2026","John Hammergren","Yeah, as I would just point out that it\u2019s \u2013 as we talked about, it's about a $0.10 impact. So it's a pretty modest impact on our operations at this point.","Kevin Caliendo","No, what I meant was you're taking an extra revenue. I'm just wondering has any material impact on your margin at all, the optics around it. I understand your\u2026","Britt Vitalone","Yeah, it\u2019s not a material impact. It's not a material impact.","Kevin Caliendo","Great, okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Glad to hear that you\u2019re considering financial segment and how that might change. But my question is actually maybe John your comments early on around the operational segmentation under Nick, how much of that is driven by simply these are now similar growth businesses versus change in what a manufacturer or dispenser needs from their wholesaler kind of the go-to-market strategy that you have. Is that changing as well and how does that fit into the operational change?","John Hammergren","Right, I think that clearly many of the manufacturers that we do business with that would be selling product through our specialty channels or into the physician office or clinic setting are the same manufacturers that are in our full-line wholesale business going to hospitals or retail pharmacy. The service requirement is significantly different, and the structure of our relationships are usually significantly different. So I think that what we'll be able to do here is benefit from the relationships we have on the various sides of our business.","Frankly, we'll go to leverage some of the structure we have, whether it's some of the functions that we have in these businesses that have been specifically focused on one business versus the other. And I think that the most important thing for us to do is to continue to think the needs of our customers whether it\u2019s a pharmacy or the physician or the pharmaceutical manufacturer and make sure that we array the set of assets to them in the best possible way and frankly also keep our cost and our overhead down so that we can be quick and efficient.","So it's probably a combination of many things. Obviously, underneath Nick are some very talented executives, and their line of sight focus on U.S. Oncology or some of the other ologies and businesses that we're focused on will remain. So I don't see a collapsing, so to speak, of the people that are selling things to hospitals into the same group that's servicing our U.S. Oncology network is an example.","Eric Percher","And as you look at the segmentation, is there more room to run with the corporate efficiency program [indiscernible] in the innings of \u2013 I mean do you expect that to continue on into next year? ","John Hammergren","I\u2019ll let Britt jump in here. Yes I would say, Eric, we have certainly, as John mentioned, as we think about a ring, our business is under a leader like Nick, as we look across all of our businesses. We've made great progress against our corporate expense in our segment expense initiatives. I think we still have tremendous opportunity, and we always focus on efficiency and looking to take cost opportunities so that we can better service our customers. So I think those are things that we'll always do, and I think we've made great progress in the last 18 months, but you should see us continue to focus on as we go forward.","Eric Percher","And just relative to the next year, as we look at this year, has the management incentive plan been at \u2013 fully funded? Is there any catch-up that has to occur as we go from 2018 to 2019? ","John Hammergren","Why \u2013 we don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 to be frank, I haven't looked at the management incentive plan accruals recently, but I don't think there's a huge delta last year to this year or this year into a fully funded or less than kind of funded basis. So it's not something I think that will be something you have to focus on, Eric, as we think about FY'19, yes.","Eric Percher","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from George Hill from RBC. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Yes, good morning guys. John, as we think about the differentiated pricing model, what should we think of is the key drivers of profit growth going forward? Is it underlying volume? Is it price? Is it business mix like it business mix like the growth in specialty business versus generic growth? I guess any color here would be helpful. ","John Hammergren","Thanks George for the question. Clearly, volume, price and mix are all important elements as we think about our business. And clearly, we're fortunate to be participating in an industry that is continuing to grow, both through innovation but also through demand, and the combination of those factors make us positive about our outlook. We are excited to be in health care and excited about our position in it and our focus on pharmaceuticals we think is an important one.","I think that the biggest change that we've talked about today and even Britt was talking about it related to the third quarter is the evolving mix of our business. And these higher-priced, more specialty products that we believe deliver tremendous value and frankly, take cost out of the health care system, do have a negative mix or margin experience on us as we think about our overall P&L.","And so what we've been attempting to do and been very successful at it as we find these five categories of pricing is to position our value proposition to the customers in such a way that they're \u2013 we're getting properly paid for the service we provide and that our business is evolving. Our business strategy and our business financials are appropriately evolving as our mix evolves. And that's probably the biggest change you'll see this continued mix shift towards specialty products.","George Hill","Okay. And then I guess just a quick follow-up then. I guess just one last one on generics would be, as we think of the profit pool that's generated off of the sales of generic drugs, is that profit pool generally concentrated in a smaller number of products or even in half of the number of products? Or is it more broad-based? And I'm just thinking about this in comparison to when we saw profits concentrated in a smaller number of profits from the period of generic drug price inflation.","John Hammergren","Well, I think that the \u2013 you all have access to the data that tells you which molecules are selling with greater volumes, and you also have pricing data not from us, but from an industry perspective, so you can kind of volume weight the mix of the industry and get some kind of overall view of where the dollars are spent. As it relates to the margin effect on the company like McKesson, that's difficult to discuss, given that there \u2013 that some of these molecules, even though they might be big and dollars, may have many, many competitors and, therefore, the profit opportunities may be reduced because of the competitive activities associated with those molecules.","But I think we continue to see the generic market as attractive to us. Our position is very strong, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of generics, not just in line with the market, but in some cases, we further penetrate our existing customers by taking on more and more of their generic sourcing and spend requirements. And so when Britt talks about the success of ClarusONE, part of the \u2013 of our value is taking our scale into the marketplace with all of our customers and giving them an affordable alternative to buying from some of these telemarketers and others that may have chipped away at our overall share position.","And then, obviously, the launch cycle is less favorable today than \u2013 in terms of new products than it might have been a year ago.","I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess most of my question has been asked. Maybe, Britt, on Change Healthcare, you made a comment contribution was down sequentially, and you said there was some issues in the imaging business. You called out a deferral in purchases. Does that mean we would expect those to come back in the next quarter, or maybe give us more thoughts on \u2013 inside on what's going on the part of the business and what we kind of expect even beyond just the updated contribution? Thanks.","John Hammergren","Well, thanks for the question Charles. This is John I\u2019m probably going to help Britt on this one given that he's pretty new to the team's health care activity, and we've just recently put him on the Board to replace James. We've had the imaging business inside McKesson for a long time. It's a great, great business with a very large franchise and a great market position and really a competitive product line. That business now is a, in whole, part of Change Health are and so our visibility to it has been reduced to some extent, given that we don't manage that business directly. It's managed by the Change Healthcare executive team.","But I do \u2013 obviously, the McKesson people that are there, we talk frequently. And I would say that the biggest thing that we've seen is a change in the purchase cycle of our customers, and we would have expected them to continue to be buying new equipment and up \u2013 and refreshing their imaging work, and that usually provides us an opportunity to win the software that goes along with it than what we've seen is that \u2013 is significantly flatter market than we would have anticipated in the replacement cycle for some of this equipment, and, therefore, we see a flatness in our revenues in our imaging business. So, I think it's really driven more by market characteristics related to the use of capital by our largest customers and that capital being either not deployed at all or deployed in other areas.","Having said that, we believe a lot of this imaging equipment is going to have to be replaced. It's just not contemporary any longer and when that replacement cycle comes back, the Change Healthcare imaging business, we believe, will begin to grow nicely again with its leadership position.","John Hammergren","So, it's time for us to end this call. I want to thank you, Cecilia, for this work as an operator, and I want to thank all of you on the call today. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our eyecare value of putting the customers first in all that we do. To underline this point, McKesson is once again ranked number one in our industry by Fortune Magazine in its 2018 World's Most Admired Companies survey. This annual survey measures corporate reputation and performance against several key attributes. While we are honored to be recognized for the second year in a row with this award, I'm deeply humbled by the work of our more than 75,000 employees whose unwavering focus on our customers will ensure our continued success as we move forward.","In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2018 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2019 outlook when we provide our fourth quarter's earnings results in May.","Thank you, and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."],"14282":["McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) Q1 2019 Earnings Call July 26, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","John H.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you. Thank you, Lynette. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson.","In addition to the company's periodic Current and Annual Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slides for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects.","We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful when reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today.","Thank you, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Craig and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a solid start to fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.90, consistent with our expectations. Given our recent update provided at our Investor Day in late June, I will focus my attention on a few topics and will let Britt go through the quarter financial results in greater detail.","I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress we've made against our multiyear strategic growth initiative. First, we continued to proactively execute against our priority growth areas namely the manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy. In the past quarter, we closed the Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD acquisition. We accelerated the commercialization for a recently approved specialty prescription medicine with the reimbursement hub in specialty pharmacy support services representing one of the largest programs launched to-date. This is one example of a number of planned future commercializations with this partner and many others. We are executing against the business cases for other recent acquisitions such as CoverMyMeds, intraFUSION, Well.ca and RxCrossroads that also support our priority growth areas, which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth.","Second, we launched a program designed to optimize and drive an efficient operating structure that supports our prioritized growth areas. Britt will discuss these initiatives in more detail shortly.","Next let me touch on our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. You'll recall in our year-end earnings call that I outlined a series of initiatives we took in Q2 of last year. These were in response to certain UK government actions. We have substantially achieved the results we outlined, generating savings and efficiencies from the plan we initiated in Q2 last year, rationalizing the store footprint and streamlining our back-office operations.","On June 29, the government announced additional cuts to retail pharmacy reimbursement. Although helpful, the restructuring program we put in place in fiscal 2018 will not fully mitigate these new cuts. We will continue to respond to event-driven government actions through company-specific mitigation efforts. We also remain committed to continued policy and education discussions with the health ministry to ensure patients have ongoing access to care in low-cost and convenient settings.","We have spoken previously about how retail pharmacy would help to ensure the sustainability of the health system in the UK and elsewhere as more services migrate from higher cost locations into the lower cost pharmacy setting. And the pharmacist plays a critical role in providing a range of personalized healthcare services to the patient.","Now, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss our perspective on the recently-announced Health and Human Services blueprint request for information or RFI. The current administration is focused on fostering an affordable, accessible healthcare system that puts patients first, and we fully share this goal. We were also encouraged by the broad scope of the RFI, solving a myriad of healthcare issues is not a simple task and it requires a comprehensive evaluation of the challenges and opportunities.","While policy decisions are being evaluated, McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact patients, our industry and our business partners, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally.","We can help drive the stated objectives of the administration. Today, we support patient access through affordable generic medication. We do this by leveraging our global scale and efficiency. We're proud to be a leader supporting clinical trials to help bring innovative specialty therapies to market through an increasingly optimized path and to partner with manufacturers and other stakeholders to help bring these new drugs to the patients who need them. We have extensive experience in supporting value-based care with tools, processes and expertise for both commercial and government payers and many of you will recall that through partnership with manufacturers almost 15 years ago, we were able to transform our business model by introducing inventory management agreements and distribution service agreements that significantly improved transparency across the supply chain.","Many of you know that distribution service agreements compensate distributors for the fair value of the services provided. These agreements appropriately consider the requirement to maintain an efficient, secure and safe supply chain, high service levels, as well as substantial working capital investment made when taking title to inventory or collecting customer receivables, which together represents tens of billions of dollars on our balance sheet.","To the extent changes are made to the current model, we are well-equipped to facilitate the change and to again partner with all stakeholders to ensure a smooth and effective transition. The value we deliver has been validated over the past 15 years through contract renewals, and expanded relationships both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. We remain confident we will continue to demonstrate the value of our highly-scaled and efficient distribution network, our services and capabilities, far into the future.","McKesson has the patient at the center of how we think and we want to continue to be a leader in bringing real solutions to the debate that helps to lower cost while improving access and quality.","Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent an in-line performance across our segments. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled and efficient foundation, our clear focus on several priority growth areas and improving the efficiency of our operating structure, our leading Technology Solutions for our partners and of course our strong financial position.","We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and to deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, John. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 first quarter results were in-line with our expectations and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share. Please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today. I'll start with the results for the first quarter.","Turning to slide 6 of the presentation, first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.90 represents an increase of 18% year-over-year driven by a lower tax rate and share count, and growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, partially offset by previously discussed headwinds in our European and Canadian businesses, and a negative $0.05 foreign currency impact.","Our first quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP-only items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.74 per diluted share; acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.22 per diluted share; LIFO inventory-related credit of $0.07 per diluted share; gains from antitrust legal settlements of $0.13 per diluted share; restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.42 per diluted share; and other adjustment net charges of $2.41 per diluted share, largely comprising a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, primarily triggered by the recently-announced UK government reimbursement reductions as well as a change to our segment reporting structure.","As detailed on slide 7, as a function of our segment reporting change in Q1 of FY 2019, our European business is no longer considered a single reporting unit. Following the change during the quarter, the segment was split into two distinct reporting units: Consumer Solutions and Pharmacy Solutions. We're conducting impairment testing of this new reporting unit level. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. Given that impairment testing is now being performed at a more discrete level for this segment, future negative events will trigger additional evaluation and we may be required to report impairment charges in the future.","As John discussed, on June 29, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts to retail pharmacy. The cuts reduced our estimation of future cash flows resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. We responded to prior government action through our previously announced divestiture of closure of approximately 200 retail stores and, as a result of these recent actions, we are evaluating the effects these measures will have on our business. We will engage in discussions with the UK government to articulate the critical value pharmacy plays.","We also recorded restructuring and other charges in the first quarter. These charges primarily relate to the ongoing execution of our multiyear strategic growth initiative. We're making solid progress to restructure and reshape our operating model and investment in strategic growth initiatives we have previously communicated. We're executing against the operating model framework we previously discussed. As one example, after a comprehensive review, we've expanded our strategic partnership with a business process outsource provider, which will allow us to continue our transformation of key supporting functions. This important step will allow us to swiftly move select functions out of our operations into our business process service provider, reducing costs and increasing productivity.","We're making progress against our enterprise spend program. We've identified several cost categories that will leverage the scale of McKesson. We're confident these initiatives will generate meaningful and sustained savings. We expect to provide quantification of the operating model and cost-out targets next quarter. And we continue to expect to incur GAAP-only after-tax restructuring and other charges of approximately $150 million to $210 million in fiscal 2019. I'll remind you that these GAAP charges are not included in our adjusted earnings outlook.","Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated first quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 8. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 3% versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2%. First quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth including the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior-year and acquisitions, partially offset by customer losses.","First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by acquisitions. Adjusted income from operations was $796 million for the year (sic) [quarter] (13:36), an increase of 1%. Interest expense of $61 million decreased 10% for the quarter driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings.","Now let's move to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business and a discrete tax benefit. We continue to assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23% for the year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, income attributable to non-controlling interest was $58 million for the quarter, an increase of 4%. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to decline year-over-year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $589 million with first quarter adjusted earnings of $2.90 per diluted share, up 18% compared to $2.46 in the prior year.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 203 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed approximately $300 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 200 million for the year.","Next, I'll review our segment results which can be found on slides 9 to 12. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We now report results in three main segments, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions.","All other businesses which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other. We believe that this segment reporting provides increased transparency and visibility of the underlying operating performance of the businesses within McKesson. In addition, in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2018, contribution from Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed $17 million in adjusted operating profit for both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 for a total contribution of $34 million.","We start first with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in branded to generic conversion. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 2% to $540 million, driven by market growth, the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior year and growth in our Plasma and Biologics distribution business, which is partially offset by customer losses.","The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 132 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point as increased branded compensation was offset by our mix of business. We continue to see a growing mix in specialty pharmaceutical and we continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although it is dilutive to the margin rate.","Moving now to European Pharmaceutical Solutions, revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, up 9%. Revenues benefited from $487 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven by market growth and acquisitions, largely offset by the previously disclosed increased competition in France, as well as a reduction in owned retail pharmacies in the UK following the closure and divestiture of approximately 200 stores.","Segment-adjusted operating profit was down 12% to $74 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 18% to $69 million driven by the impact of reduced reimbursement and the reclassification of certain prescriptions of over-the-counter products in our UK retail pharmacy business and increased competition in the French wholesale markets. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 107 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 25 basis points. As a result of the first quarter segment performance, as well as the incremental government cuts I mentioned earlier, we now expect segment-adjusted operating profit to be at the low end of the previously provided range of flat to mid-single digit growth.","Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% driven by market growth and one month of contribution from the MSD acquisition. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was flat at $125 million driven by market growth offset by timing of certain events. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 734 basis points, a decrease of 81 basis points, reflecting our mix of business.","Finishing our business review with Other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 5%. Revenues benefited from $111 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions, largely offset by the impact of government actions in our McKesson Canada business and the prior-year sale of the EIS business. Other adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $213 million.","On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $204 million driven by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the prior year's sale of the EIS business and a lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, partially offset by growth in MRxTS. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $64 million for the quarter.","Next, McKesson reported $95 million in adjusted corporate expense, a decrease of 16% in constant currency year-over-year primarily driven by timing and lower incentive compensation. We continue to anticipate that adjusted corporate expenses will decline in the low double-digit percentage in fiscal 2019.","I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on slide 13. Our receivables days sales outstanding was flat at 26 days, days sales in inventory increased 1 day to 30 days and days payables outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior-year to 58 days. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. For the quarter, McKesson paid $826 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $300 million in common stock and paid $71 million in dividends.","In the first quarter, McKesson used $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, our operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on timing. As we discussed on our Q4 conference call, in the fourth quarter, we received a customer payment that had been anticipated for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","After deducting $145 million for internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion, again in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion.","And yesterday, our board of directors approved an increase of $0.05 for our quarterly dividend or 15% to $0.39, which will be payable to shareholders in October. The increase to our dividend reflects our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders as part of a balanced approach to capital deployment. We also have a total of $4.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Before I wrap up, we continue to expect a positive foreign currency impact of up to $0.10 in fiscal 2019 and, in terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the second half will have a stronger relative EPS contribution similar to our fiscal 2018 results.","In closing, I'm pleased with the progress being made on our operating model and cost-out initiatives, which will drive increased efficiency and productivity in our operations and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We had a solid start to fiscal 2019 and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 outlook with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13 to $13.80.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask you to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Take your first caller, Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to discuss two pretty high-level issues that I think are on everyone's mind and just sort of get your take. There's been a lot of rhetoric in the market around branded price inflation. You've seen some activity by a number of the manufacturers and so I'm kind of curious, have you had conversations regarding that and how you think that could ultimately impact the balance of your fiscal year?","And then secondly, my follow-up would be around the administration's criticism around the current rebating system and the potential push to move from gross-to-net pricing and so both those issues in aggregate could have at least a meaningful near-term impact on your business and I'm sure there will be some type of mitigation efforts, but could you just give us your updated thinking on both those issues? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the questions, Glen. Clearly, both of these issues are not new to the discussion. I think obviously the concerns or the comments around it have increased in frequency in the last several months, but several years ago, people began to talk about the widening spread, the use of rebates, the transparency or lack thereof of those tools and clearly, we've dealt with the changes in branded inflation for many years.","I mentioned in my opening comments about the transition 15 years ago that the company I think helped lead to a more stabilized, more transparent relationship with the branded manufacturers in particular, focused on making sure that our model was not fully dependent on price inflation as one of the key drivers to our economics and over time, we've discussed with our shareholders that the view that we maintain some exposure to price increases in our P&Ls, but that exposure is significantly less than what it would have been going back in time and our relationship with manufacturers continues to be extremely productive.","We have not only renewed all of those relationships time and time again over 15 years, but the conversations with the manufacturers have broadened in their context to include not just Distribution Solutions, but also go-to-market solutions as I highlighted also in my opening comments, helping people with product launches, helping them handle specialty products that require a lot of additional attention, and clearly helping them get better take-up on their new launches as well as better adherence to the prescriptions being written by physicians and reducing the friction, things like CoverMyMeds, those tools, allow patients to get access to these drugs faster, better economics and clearly without having to wait sometimes weeks to get authorization to take the meds. So, we've been evolving the model with branded manufacturers and specialty manufacturers, and I'm quite pleased and positive about my future outlook of our evolution of services focused on those manufacturers.","As it relates to the impact of the year, I think Britt and I continue to evaluate how much value we expect in our guidance relative to branded price inflation and obviously we provided a range at the beginning of the year with an expectation of where that branded inflation would likely come in. Clearly, the month of July we believe is running at a rate that's less than what we would have normally expected, but I think several of these manufacturers have talked about delaying their price actions until later in the year, as they see how this transition or this model change progresses or doesn't progress. So, I think we're committed to continue to work with manufacturers and to make sure that we mitigate whatever negative impacts might occur as a result of their change.","As it relates to the rebating that goes on, clearly, we are students of this industry and have some awareness of the to-ing and fro-ing of the manufacturing relationships with those that are negotiating formularies with them. We don't participate in the rebate structure that goes to the payers and the debate on gross-to-net is a very interesting discussion because as I've described I think in the past on conversations with you and others that although there obviously is a financially net price or average price that's realized by our manufacturing partners, that's not a single net. It's an aggregation of multiple nets and I don't see necessarily the ability or the desire of the industry to have a one-price for all type of a strategy.","Now, we don't control what the manufacturers do and we don't have any input on how they set their prices, how much inflation they have or how much rebate they provide to the people in the channel, but what I would say is that if there is a significant reduction in the list price of these products where most of the driver of our economics is derived from, then we will be in discussions with manufacturers to make sure that we get the appropriate reimbursement for the fair value of the services we provide and our rate of return on a lower sell price would have to reflect the recoupment of that value so that we come out at a similar place to where we are today.","We clearly agree with many others in the channel that cash payers of these drugs are being forced to pay list price and other abnormalities as they have risen over decades of these types of business models need to be addressed and Americans should get a fair price for the pharmaceuticals, but at the same time, a system like this that has been developed over decades can't be completely reengineered in a matter of weeks and months, and so I think it will take some time as we evolve to whatever model the manufacturers and the payers believe is appropriate going forward.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the thoughts.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Cherny from Bank of America.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. So staying along those same lines, John, it's been about a year since you outlined the initial attempts and discussions to work with your manufacturer partners on the contract shifts on how you contract with them. Clearly, there's a lot going on as Glen had asked regarding the overall market. Can you talk about how those discussions have continued to go and maybe just give some hypothetical examples or some big picture examples of what some of the evolution has been in any of the contracts that may have changed structure or changed how they're contracted between the two sides just to give us a sense of as we think about the go-forward what we could expect to see with those changing negotiations?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thank you for the question, Michael. The manufacturers obviously all of them are in different places in terms of how they price their products, the level of innovation that they're delivering to their marketplace, the productivity of their R&D activities, et cetera. And so I think, I can't speak with any specifics with any of them related to our relationship. What I can say is sort of a reinforcement of what I said to Glen and that is that the relationship between McKesson and our manufacturer partners has never been stronger, and when we've had conversations with them about their strategies related to price inflation or their strategies related to their list price of their product, never in those conversations do they indicate a desire to reduce the economics to McKesson because they recognize the tremendous value of the services we provide. So albeit, it may be a time and a process change that goes on between us and our partners related to how we're reimbursed and how these mechanisms might evolve over time, nowhere has anyone said to me, gee, we need to change this model because we believe the economics that we're paying for the value you deliver isn't fair. In fact, it's quite the opposite.","They talk about not wanting to do what we do and the fact that we provide great utility value both to our buying customers as well as the manufacturers that we're both trying to serve. So, I think that I'm very confident that we will continue to make progress and as individual decisions are made by individual manufacturers related to their pricing strategy, we'll sit down and have individual discussions with them to make sure that we're properly reimbursed for the value of the service we provide and clearly, we always are trying to expand that discussion to include more than just our distribution services and go beyond into some of the other services that I described. And I'm probably the only remaining CEO in the distribution channel that actually went through the process 15 years ago and helped lead the process of providing better visibility to the manufacturers around the value of we do, providing better stability around our reimbursement, and in those leadership discussions, I think set a standard for how McKesson would move forward and I believe that standard still exists today.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Mike, maybe what I would add \u2013 this is Britt, I would add that over the last couple of years, the conversations have really become around focusing on the value for the services and expanding the services that we provide, whether that's special handling for certain new products that are being launched and as you've seen us over the last couple of years, you've seen less of a reliance on the variable component of compensation with manufacturers and really focusing on what are the services that we're providing and what is the value for those services and what additional services can we provide to those manufacturers, whether that's distribution services or those are other capabilities that we can help them with launching a product. So I think that's one of the ways that you've seen the conversations change over the last couple of years.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks Michael for the question and I want to also congratulate you by the way on the birth of your new daughter Reece (33:54). I was just told that recently, so congratulations on starting a new era.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much, John.","Operator","And at this time, we'll move to the next caller in the queue, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. John, last night, CMS proposed that we move to a new competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs. The way that it reads, it comments that they're looking to use private vendors to negotiate Part B drugs replacing ASP. Can you talk about it from two sides? One, the role that you think McKesson could play as a private vendor and two, any impact that any new pricing could have on your existing business? I'm thinking specifically U.S. oncology?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you point out, U.S. oncology is the part of our business that has the greatest exposure to Part B reimbursement, and we are probably one of the largest purchasers of specialty drugs primarily focused on oncology. And we certainly have experienced over time our ability to work closely with the manufacturers to make sure that we've got the right economics on sourcing those products and making sure that the patients are getting access to the best available treatment regimes, and we believe that role is extremely important.","In addition, I think that folks in the administration that I've chatted with when we've discussed this particular issue understand clearly that the best value for them as payers for cancer care continues to be in the community setting, and their view of our quality is as good or better than anyone else in the provider network. So I don't think there's a desire in specifics to focus on community-based physicians in any category let alone community-based oncologists in an attempt to destroy the economics of practicing in that venue. What they are focused on is making sure that the economics are maintained perhaps in a different way than just or just primarily on the drug's reimbursement characteristics.","So we've had an open dialogue for some time. Like I said, there may be a transition here in terms of how oncologists are paid for the services they provide. And clearly as a very large buyer of these Part B drugs, we think we're in a good position to be a private vendor who negotiates the purchase price of the Part B drugs because we have the pull through characteristics attaching great formularies that utilize those drugs and provide market share to the manufacturers as a result of them providing us with the right economics and that's a role that we already play today with our buying activity. So albeit this could be another transition point for our business that may take some time to straighten out, but I think at least from my experience, having the best value from an economic perspective and the best quality aligned creates a position for you to be able to negotiate a model that makes sense for both the payers as well as for us and I might end my comment on the relative scale or meaningfulness of this as it relates to McKesson's overall financial characteristics.","Clearly this is important to our physician partners and their viability is a top priority for us, and the ability to continue to treat patients in that setting is a top priority; however the economics that actually flow through to McKesson's P&L as a result of our relationship with the U.S. Oncology doctors in particular is relatively insignificant.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll hear next from David Larsen from Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a little bit about the operating income growth rate in the Other division? It looks to me like it's actually down year-over-year. Is that correct, Britt maybe, and then how is Change Healthcare progressing? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for that question. As we pointed out during our Q4 earnings call, we did expect it to be impacted by the headwinds in our Canadian business. We outlined for you the changes in the generic reimbursement rate would have a gross headwind of $100 million to $125 million for the year, so that certainly is part of it. We are seeing really good growth in our MRxTS business as I mentioned in my remarks and then the third piece here is while we did see a decline year-over-year in Change Healthcare in the quarter, we still expect that Change Healthcare will meet the full year guide that we gave.","We're seeing good operating performance. We're seeing good performance and progression against synergy targets. We're pleased with our performance, so I think the overriding impact here in the first quarter is really two-fold. One, the Canadian headwinds that I mentioned and then secondly, last year, we did have about $17 million of operating profit from EIS, which we have divested.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just any comments on generic deflation trends both on the buy and sell-side? How are those relative to your expectations and how did ClarusONE perform relative to expectations? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for that question. We haven't seen any change from what we guided at our Investor Day. On the sell-side we still see a competitive but relatively stable market so no change in our view on the sell-side component of that. ClarusONE continues to perform quite well ahead of very strong first quarter. We're very pleased with the progress there and the partnership and the opportunities that are in front of us.","From a buy perspective, the dynamics on the buy side, as we've talked about we've seen more of a stable environment from a deflation perspective, so this is running in-line with what our expectations were, really no supply disruptions that are of any material either and ClarusONE continues to drive great value from a buy side, so we're continuing to focus on building out ClarusONE and additional opportunities and taking the ability that we have on ClarusONE to create a spread for us that we can deliver great value to our customers on the sell-side.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Steven Valiquette from Barclays your line is open.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just on staying on the topic of brand inflation, we keep getting asked by investors how to triangulate the collective commentary from drug distributors overall, then brand inflation doesn't matter that much anymore because of the fee-for-service agreements, but then the industry still has this large spike in profits in the March quarter each year that obviously seems pretty closely tied to the January annual brand price inflation cycle. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that and maybe just the follow-up question tied to that would be, should we probably assume that McKesson is going to maintain a fairly wide EPS guidance range for most of fiscal 2019 because obviously your fiscal fourth quarter may be the most critical in relation to brand inflation. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for that question. I would point to a couple things. First of all, you are right. Historically we have seen the manufacturers take the majority of their price increases in our fiscal fourth quarter. There is an impact from seasonality. We have our highest volumes in the fourth quarter, so the impact we would see from those would be higher just given that seasonality, and I would also point out that while we are more fixed than we have been historically, there is still a variable component to our compensation. So I would expect that that trend would continue. It is more of a seasonality component than anything else.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. As far as the guidance range then for the year?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","I think as we've talked about previously, we're not adjusting our guidance at this point. We have seen lower price inflation as John mentioned in the July month. If we see some changes to that that are significant, then certainly we will update you on that but we would expect to still be in the guidance range that we provided.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Moving next to Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So, obviously, pretty disappointing developments in the UK business. I guess that business obviously has been trending lower and we felt we were getting to kind of the bottom of margins and then obviously the UK has a lot going on economically right now. I guess how are you thinking about sort of the pushes and pulls there in France and some of the other countries where there's sort of uncertainty around your ability to kind of adjust the cost structure as these kind of sea changes occur and the ability to kind of balance that versus kind of the long-term you see in those markets?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thanks for the question, Ross. Clearly, we are disappointed with the continued actions that the UK government has been pursuing, primarily focused on the retail pharmacy business there to your point. At some point there's going to be diminishing returns for this to be a source of their budget gap solved, and our dialogue with them is continuing. We don't want to be in a position where we find that the government puts us in a place where the entire retail industry is at risk and clearly, the more cuts that come down the line, the more likely that is to be a possibility, and perhaps a reality.","So we are working to be more efficient in that market. We talked about the changes we made in our back-office in the fourth quarter. We continue to take cost-out, and the store closures have helped and if they push more stores into a lack of profitability, we may have to continue with that strategy.","As it relates to France, we're obviously a very large provider of services in France. We've got great customer relationships. We've got a great strategy there. It's one of the markets where we have really delivered an omni-channel capability with online, in-store pick up et cetera, experiences for our partners to take to their patients and I think our presence in the market is really second to none.","We have recently in the last 18 months or so experienced more significant price activity by our competitors probably in response to our superior value proposition and we've been forced to react to that in certain parts of the French market, but as we have in the UK and other markets in Europe, we'll continue to expand the value proposition and at the same time try to become more efficient and in particular in France, we did develop a national re-distribution center, similar to what we have in the U.S. that is performing at exceptional levels and allowing us to take out cost and capital in that market and deliver superior service and our scale frankly allows us to compete in a much superior way to others in that marketplace.","So we're not going to lose market share there. We're going to match the price that our competitors put into the marketplace and maintain the volumes through our business and we hope that the pricing environment will stabilize over time.","The larger backdrop of Europe is we're continuing to expand our services in many different areas, and begin to evolve our model so that we can provide services outside of retail pharmacy into specialty and hospital and home care like we've done in the UK, so we're still focused on expanding that business. Thanks, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, John. And maybe just quickly, a lot of debate on biosimilars. Obviously the government is very focused on it. There's some new developments with new labs and a few others, I guess what's sort of your updated thoughts on how that market is kind of changing and the like and kind of your opportunity set there?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, we obviously are very encouraged as well not only in the government's focus on the biosim opportunities and getting these products into the marketplace but the manufacturer partners that have come to us in particular are looking for McKesson to help them build a channel into the marketplace, in particular in biosims focused on oncology.","As you know, Ross we have a world-leading clinical trial capability inside of our U.S. oncology network that provides value to all oncologists across the country. We help get products to the market faster and more efficiently and we have done that over and over again as it relates to branded product being launched.","We think the biosimilar market provides a similar opportunity because of some of the characteristics of these products and a requirement to prove clinical equivalency to the original products and our doctors are very keen on helping make that happen and making sure the patients get the best product at the most value and that helps produce market share for the biosim manufacturers and improved profitability for their practices and a lower-cost for the patient.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Thanks, John.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Eric Percher from Nephron Research, please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. A question on U.S. Pharma and Specialty. Last year, when you spoke to brand pharma compensation and the fact there was a tailwind in the quarter, I think there was an evening out over the course of the year. So when we look at this quarter I understand it sounds like that was a bit of a benefit to Q1. How does that progress over the next couple quarters and any other commentary on the cadence within that segment?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for that question, Eric. My comments really relate to that timing event that happened last year between Q1 and Q2. Our compensation or the value that we've earned from brand compensation in the first quarter of this year is in-line with what our expectations are and we wouldn't expect that there'd be any variability as we saw last year between first quarter and second quarter.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","And last year, was that a headwind in Q1 that's been evened out over the course of the year, and I guess my question is should we expect that things get a little bit tougher in that comparison? And I'll add-on to that, the follow-on question which is among the other headwinds you expect this year, how many of those are reflected now in Q1 versus building over the course of the year?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","First of all, there was a headwind in Q1 of last year. It was really between the two quarters, so we wouldn't expect \u2013 and that was related to our continued evolvement of our agreements with manufacturers. As we think about the quarters this year, we wouldn't expect there to be any headwinds from types of evolvement of agreements like we had last year, so I think as you think about the first quarter of this year, we did have that timing event between Q1 and Q2 of last year. We also had customer losses that we talked about in our numbers in Q1 this year, but we still had some growth overall.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Moving next to Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So just to clarify on Eric's question, Britt, when we think about the second half acceleration, in your prepared comment you said the second half acceleration is similar to last year. To give us some context, in 2018, what percent of second half acceleration can be attributed to the March quarter inflation?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I don't believe I used the word acceleration. I used the word relative contribution, and as we think about our second half, we would expect the same types of contribution in the second half would be the same this year as it was last year. What Eric asked about was a very specific event in Q1 of last year that was timing between Q1 and Q2, and that was related to our continued evolvement around our branded contracts become more fixed, so we would expect the dynamics of our quarters in the second half of the year to be very similar this year as they were last year.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","On a proportional basis.","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Relative contribution basis.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the second question, John. Many, many factors are suggesting moving the payment model to a fixed price system, which is not really benchmarked to a metric that's impacted by price. You operate in Europe where the model is a fixed fee based. So can you maybe kind of give us some color or some observation about what you see in Europe? Is it where you could potentially draw some similarities to how the markets here in the U.S. will evolve? Maybe what are the differences in terms of the economic value between the two regions?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","While I appreciate the question, Ricky, I think it has several nuances in it. In Europe, there's not really a single model or a single reimbursement mechanism. I would say though in certain markets, the reimbursement is more dictated by the government and can sometimes be different based on brand versus generic and who the payers are for generic and whether they've outsourced the payments for generics and contracted for generic to other parties et cetera, et cetera, including we talked about the Canadian environment where the price of generic is set by government but it's a percentage of the branded price for the non-generic. So there's all kinds of different ways people have set up pricing regimens.","We believe \u2013 it was my interpretation of the administration is that they're looking for the market to set prices and the conversation that Lisa had a few minutes ago where she talked about the government looking for private vendors to negotiate the price of drugs is another indication of the fact that the government does not want to play a role, in my view at least, the government doesn't want to play a role in price setting.","This idea that Part B drugs are set by the government and not through some type of a process is something that they appear to be wanting to change. So I think, frankly, there is not going to be a coming together of the way drug reimbursement happens in Europe and the way it's going to happen in the U.S. It's more likely that market forces will shape the way U.S. drug prices are set. There'll be more transparency to consumers who are increasingly paying more and more of a portion of their drug spend through their benefit plan designs that companies like ours and others have put in place for their employees. And so, I frankly am encouraged by that move and I believe it allows McKesson to continue to work with the manufacturers and to negotiate reimbursement based on the fair value of what we deliver every day for them and in my view it can't be disconnected from the dollar value of the product that we are putting through our channel.","Unlike a \"shipper\" of a product that would charge a fee for a box at a certain weight, McKesson's financial model is much more dynamic and much more significant and much more dependent on our ability to buy inventory, use our balance sheet, provide tremendous service levels to our customers, collect receivables, adjudicate prices, thousands of prices every day through our chargeback systems on behalf of the manufacturers and to manage contracts with GPOs and to do all kinds of things that go far beyond what a logistics provider is prepared to do. And because of our use of our balance sheet and the use of our financial systems and our knowledge of this industry built over 185 years, I think it's highly unlikely that we would go to some type of a fixed fee or per-unit fee model for McKesson. It would have to reflect the use of our financial tools and our role in the entire supply chain for pharmaceuticals in a fashion that's very similar today.","So what's more likely to happen is the rate that we receive on the price of the product, however that price gets set, would be reflective of the value in dollars that we need to receive to be properly reimbursed for those services. So that's the strategy that we think works best for us. It's a strategy we think reflects the value of what we deliver every day and it's a strategy that we think the manufacturers are already used to having with us and that we think can be replicated going forward albeit there may be some transition timeframes that we'll have to work our way through.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yes.","Operator","We'll move next to Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. John, as I think about the UK business and the series of price cuts that you've seen, does McKesson have the ability to go back to the manufacturer \u2013 the drug manufacturers for price concessions to pass on some of the cuts? And then I know it's a different business but as we think about your relationship with the manufacturers here, I mean, how does that translate in terms of \u2013 I heard you talk about the value proposition, but if we can't pass price cuts in the UK, where is the confidence that we can pass on some of the price cuts or adjustments here in the U.S. in the future?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thank you for the question. Clearly, the way the UK manages drug pricing both and service pricing for that matter is vastly different than the way it's managed here in the U.S. and the government's activities both on the manufacturer price as well as the retail service price is not established based on what we can at least determine as a market view. It's more of a policy view, and we continue to work with the payers to make sure the payer there, to make sure they understand the value we believe is being derived by using Retail Pharmacy. It's difficult for us to go back to the manufacturers when their economics are preset also by the same regulatory body with perhaps a different regime. So I think we're stuck in a little different place in the UK related to what might be actionable with the manufacturers.","Now, clearly, on the services front, we can do a series of different things as a wholesaler to make sure that we're properly paid for the service we provide in those markets. I think as a retailer though because the government is involved in the retail dispensing economics for drugs, it makes it more of a challenge.","I don't believe that anything that I'm hearing from the discussions with the administration here in the U.S. or my counterparts in the industry, I'm not hearing any discussion of people wanting to follow a model similar to what's being done in the UK as an example. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's much more likely to take a market-based approach.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Guys, thank you.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for the questions. John, I know there's been a lot asked on this call and a lot of focus on branded price increases but I just wanted to make sure if I try to summarize this, is this the right way to think about it? Is this the right message? So if there are in fact less branded price increases over time, as a wholesaler, as the pharmaceutical wholesaler, you need to just adjust the rate at which manufacturers pay you for the fair value that you bring, and ultimately you guys are confident that that will happen over time. Is that a fair summation of kind of the message around the potential change in branded increases?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I think it's a fair assessment of not only that dimension but also the question related to a massive reduction in the retail or list price of the product to a lesser price, whether that is defined as a gross-to-net discussion or a lower list price discussion, or a better value for cash payers, however that's discussed, I believe that we are going to be focused on recovering the economics related to our relationship with these individual manufacturers that allow us to continue to have the same dollar yield as we do today from the same transaction activity because the value we deliver frankly doesn't change based on their activity related to brand inflation or related to a gross-to-net-type of a discussion.","So you're absolutely right. Your summary is accurate and we did a very similar transition frankly that was more difficult 15 years ago because the manufacturers at that point were not even really aware of how wholesalers are paid or how we made money and our activity in the channel and we improved our relationships with them significantly. We helped them improve their manufacturing cadence. We gave them better visibility to service levels and inventory levels and that activity really sets the stage for us to more rapidly move our model around to accomplish a net neutral economic impact to McKesson and that will be our objective.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","John, I think that makes a lot of sense. Just one quick follow-up if I could for Britt just around that same topic. As it relates to this year, not to get too tactical but obviously there's some changes going on with branded companies and their desire to take inflation. I know inflation is a factor in the guidance for this year. Is the type of changes you're seeing, is that captured, Britt, within the ranges that you guys have out there for this year?","Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the question. Our first quarter was roughly in-line in terms of the experience that we saw with the manufacturers. July obviously has been quite a bit lower than we had anticipated and lower than what we've seen in previous years. We do anticipate at this point at least that we'll see the same type of behavior or activity by the manufacturers in the fourth quarter. To the extent that that doesn't happen it will have some impact on our numbers, and we would expect to still be in the guidance for that. So I think what we've seen in July is indicative of something different than what we've seen in the past but as we look at the whole year, we still maintain our guidance that we provided for branded price increases. But to the extent that the fourth quarter, our fiscal fourth quarter is \u2013 we experienced less branded price inflation. We'll have an impact but we would expect it to still be in the guidance.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for that.","John H.

I'd like to remind everyone this call is being recorded.","And at this time, I'll turn the floor over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Mercer","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Call.","I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, McKesson's President and Chief Operating Officer and incoming CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","John will provide opening remarks. Brian will provide a business update. And Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the next - please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statements slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, we will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin and free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period.","Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today.","Finally, for those who have not yet met her, I would like to introduce Holly Weiss. Holly Weiss was recently appointed Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. My transition to Holly will be completed ahead of our year-end earnings call. On a personal note, I would like to thank John, Brian and Britt as well as the investment community for the opportunity to work with everyone over the last few years.","And with that, thank you. And here is John Hammergren.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Craig. As you're probably aware, as he just mentioned it, this is his last earnings call. I want to thank you, Craig, for your invaluable service to our team over many years and in various roles, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.","And Holly, welcome as you -- as our new Head of Investor Relations. And thank you all for joining us on our call today.","This is my 79th earnings call with our investor community, and this call also marks my final earnings call as the leader of McKesson. I previously announced my retirement that takes effect at the end of our fiscal year. We are making solid progress with our strategic growth initiative. And despite some headwinds, the company is in a strong financial position. McKesson's future is bright.","It's been my great honor and privilege to leave this company as Chairman and CEO for nearly 20 years. Together, we've created an organization that plays a unique and significant role in health care. No one is better equipped than Brian to lead McKesson into the future. He is a gifted leader and an innovator, with deep industry knowledge and unwavering commitment to customers' success.","He has a strong vision for the future of health care, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as for how McKesson will continue to play an integral role in helping improve efficiency and effectiveness for patient care delivery.","Perhaps most important, Brian personifies our ICARE shared principles. In fact, he helped me create them as a member of my leadership team nearly 20 years ago. Throughout his tenure at McKesson, he has always placed the enterprise first, focused on teamwork, collaboration and communication and has consistently made employee engagement a high priority. I know that Brian is a right leader to take McKesson into the future. In addition, I might add, he is a great husband and a father as well as a friend and a trusted adviser of mine.","With my retirement, McKesson will be splitting the role of Chairman and CEO. Ed Mueller, our current lead independent Director will become McKesson's new independent Chairman effective April 1 and has developed a thorough understanding of McKesson over his 10 years of service and serves as a respected leader and will provide continuity for our board.","Over the balance of the fiscal year, the entire board and I will work closely with Brian and Ed to ensure a smooth transition. And after April 1, I will continue to support McKesson in an advisory capacity, and I'll remain Chairman of the Board of Change Healthcare.","I'll be forever grateful for the many things we've accomplished together as a team here at McKesson and for the incredible friendships I had made along the way. McKesson is truly a special place with our rich history, innovation, culture, and most important, our people. Every day, I'm humbled by the opportunity to leave this great organization, and together with our employees, make a positive impact across health care.","I might also mention that with many of you I've worked for years, and I want to thank you for your support overall all of these years and your friendship in some cases. You've always treated us with great respect. You've asked tough questions, but fair questions. And we've attempted to be as transparent as we possibly can.","So I appreciate the support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian?","Brian Tyler","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to be the first, probably of many, to recognize and congratulate John for the lasting impact he has had on McKesson. He and I, as he mentioned, have been colleagues and friends for a long time, and I am truly humbled by the opportunity to succeed him as McKesson's CEO.","His leadership and vision for the past 20 years have allowed McKesson to achieve the level of success that few companies ever accomplish. I'm excited to build upon his legacy. I've had the privilege of running nearly every major business in McKesson as well as leading our corporate strategy function. I know our teams. I know our capabilities, our markets, our customers, and importantly, our employees well.","To lead McKesson at this point in time is energizing, and I look forward to advancing the tremendous culture, solid foundation and global platform established by John and his team. The health care industry continues to undergo change as we focus on addressing affordability, access and quality outcomes for patients.","I'm confident that McKesson is the partner of choice for biopharma, providers and pharmacies in all segments across health care to help improve the delivery of health in our communities.","As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our strategic growth initiatives are gaining momentum. Most of the top leaders within McKesson were involved in developing our strategy to accelerate growth, supported by cost savings initiatives and operating model efficiencies, like our recently announced headquarter's move to Las Colinas.","To succeed in today's evolving market, we will need to find new ways to innovate, speed up decision-making and empower our teams so that we can provide even better value to our customers and patients everywhere.","More than 20 years ago, John helped guide our company through a time of crisis and showed us what leadership and resilience look like. Fast forward to today and McKesson's success can be seen both by the financial health of the company and our culture of doing what's right and putting the patient first.","I believe our culture truly is a competitive strength of McKesson. We thank you for that culture, John. We thank you for your tremendous leadership and accomplishments.","On behalf of all 78,000 employees, we send a very big thank you, a very big congratulations, and of course, just huge wishes for happiness in whatever is next for you. You will be missed greatly. You'll always be warmly remembered and regarded.","Now turning to the quarter. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $56 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.40, which were ahead of our expectations. As a result, we are narrowing our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share range to $13.45 to $13.65 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80.","We have reduced the top end of our guide to reflect the $0.26 impact of a customer bankruptcy that Britt will discuss in more detail. And we have raised the lower end of our guide based on the solid Q3 results and early indicators of our fourth quarter performance.","A few comments on our business results. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 6%. Last month, Rite Aid renewed their distribution and sourcing relationship with us for another 10 years, as we had contemplated in our guidance.","We're, of course, pleased that Rite Aid continues to see the value we deliver in our partnership through our industry-leading service levels, which translates to better experiences for their patients and customers; through our competitive pricing; and through our efficient operating model.","All of this helps them to succeed, and their decision further validates our sourcing scale and service levels following Rite Aid's extensive and competitive evaluation process.","As it relates to reform, we continue to monitor proposals and share our perspective and collaborate with the administration, policymakers and trade associations. And we've been in discussions with our biopharma partners and customers on opportunities to address the shared concerns of the administration around affordability, access and quality.","As the administration implements new strategies that transition from volume to value-based reimbursement, we regularly demonstrate our ability to support our customers and improve patient care delivery.","As a recent example, The US Oncology Network received incremental payments from both the Oncology Care Model and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, sometimes referred to as MIPS, reflecting the value we provide to our physician partners.","We, at McKesson, continue to believe that community-based care is the best way to address these goals and that value-based care models are important tools to drive improved patient outcomes. We expect that as various reimbursement changes are considered, the value of community-based care will continue to be recognized.","Now turning to McKesson Europe. In the third quarter, we appointed Kevin Kettler, a 13-year McKesson veteran, as Chairman of the Management Board of McKesson Europe. Kevin previously was President of Global Procurement and Sourcing. He managed the international team responsible for growing McKesson's private label generics business, which is a priority in Europe.","Additionally, Kevin served in multiple leadership roles in corporate strategy in U.S. Pharma over the years. He brings deep experience in pharmaceutical distribution, procurement, marketing and retail pharmacy to the new role in Europe.","Let me provide some color on Europe's operating performance in the quarter. Seasonality and market growth in all countries, except the U.K., drove an improved sequential and year-over-year performance. While most of Europe continues to perform well and grow, the U.K. business does face challenges. The actions we took last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations only partially mitigated the U.K. government cuts.","We previously mentioned that prior reimbursement cuts in the U.K. were in excess of historical levels and greater than we had planned for in our initial fiscal 2019 guidance. We're currently evaluating the recently released NHS Long Term Plan and were modestly encouraged by the general increase in health care funding that it proposes.","While we're pleased to see the important role of pharmacy in the plan, we believe it's premature to expect a near-term return to growth, particularly given the generally weak retail environment and the uncertainties of Brexit.","The U.K. team is working closely with internal and external stakeholders to evaluate the government dynamics and operating environment, making further changes intended to return the business to growth. We remain committed to ensuring the long-term profitability of this business.","Now some comments on our Medical-Surgical business. Medical-Surgical continues to be a real good story for us, reflecting strong market growth, incremental scale from our recent MSD acquisition and benefits from an ongoing shift to lower cost sites of care.","I'm particularly pleased with the segment's performance this quarter, especially when comparing the more normalized flu season experience so far this year against the unusually strong flu season last year.","And looking further ahead, we continue to expect incremental synergies from our MSD acquisition as we integrate operations. This acquisition directly supports our strategic growth objectives of increasing our value proposition for our manufacturer partners and expanding our solutions related to specialty pharmaceuticals.","Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare, all included in Other, saw upside in the quarter, driven by organic growth and mitigating actions in Canada to address previously discussed government generic price actions.","During the quarter, McKesson Canada continued its progress on mitigating the impact of government-imposed generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1, 2018. And together with strong organic growth in our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, we were able to offset slightly lower adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. And specifically regarding Change, as we've mentioned before, to the extent market conditions are suitable, we continue to expect an IPO in the first half of calendar 2019.","Before I turn it over to Britt to provide more detail on the performance of each of these businesses, I wanted to spend a minute just to discuss the opioid litigation and epidemic. As it relates to litigation, the timing for conclusion of the myriad of cases remains uncertain.","The magnitude of litigation expense is determined in part by the schedule set in these cases and underlying activity, which is not in our control and therefore difficult for us to project. We do take our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders seriously. We will continue to evaluate the cost of all our options as the litigation in different jurisdictions progresses.","We were encouraged by a recent decision dismissing the claims of 21 municipalities in Connecticut, finding the lawsuit to be inappropriate means to recover societal costs associated with addiction.","As for the ongoing epidemic, I, as many of you, I'm sure, are deeply concerned about the devastating impact it's having on the lives of so many people, including friends and families of McKesson. Our teams are working on solutions.","Last year, Congress passed the SUPPORT Act to address electronic prescribing, electronic prior authorization as well as some provisions related to ARCOS data, opioid production quotas and suspicious orders. Many of the provisions mirror recommendations previously made in our opioid white paper.","We also launched an Opioid Foundation that will focus on helping advance solutions to the nation's opioid crisis and is led by a distinguished physician with relevant public policy and addiction treatment experience. I'm very proud of McKesson's efforts to combat this epidemic and to support solutions for the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?","Britt Vitalone","Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, my comments will focus solely on our third quarter results and fiscal 2019 guidance. We will provide guidance for fiscal 2020 when we report fourth quarter results in May.","As Brian discussed earlier, we are pleased with our fiscal '19 third quarter results, which were ahead of our expectations. We continue to make very good progress on our strategic growth initiatives, operating model and cost optimization program.","As a result of this performance, we are narrowing our fiscal '19 adjusted earnings outlook to $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share in fiscal '19 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share.","Let's jump right into our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.40 was flat compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in our Medical-Surgical business, offset by higher tax rate, lower profit contribution from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and higher corporate expenses.","Let me take a minute to discuss tax as it relates to the higher tax rate compared to the prior year. I'll remind you that our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of 11.5% included discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million as well as the cumulative catch-up adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to reflect the new lower federal tax rate of 21%.","In addition, McKesson's fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate was positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our former Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.","Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated third quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on Slide 10. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5% versus the prior period, primarily driven by the growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions. We now anticipate low single-digit percent consolidated revenue growth.","Third quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments, including acquisitions.","Third quarter adjusted operating expenses were up 8% year-over-year due to charges related to the bankruptcy of Shopko in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of an accrual related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act and ongoing cost management.","Let me take a moment to provide more detail on the customer bankruptcy and the reversal of the New York accrual. First, we reported $60 million in pretax charges, principally related to accounts receivable with Shopko, who recently filed for bankruptcy. This amount represents substantially all the exposure related to this customer.","We believe this would correlate to an approximate $0.03 impact to the fourth quarter. While we took steps to manage payment terms and we worked closely with Shopko to ensure we were paid for the products and services delivered, we believe there is risk in our ability to secure full payment and therefore recorded charges during the quarter. We'll continue to pursue payment, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our next earnings call.","Second, as I detailed on our last quarter's call, while the New York Opioid Stewardship Act was being challenged in court at that time, McKesson reported an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results to account for our estimated portion of the annual assessment.","In mid-December, District Judge in New York ruled the legislation unconstitutional and thus unenforceable. As a result of this ruling, McKesson reversed all previously reported charges totaling approximately $17 million. We will continue to track this matter following an appeal filed earlier this month.","While we benefited from the favorable ruling in reversal of the charge for New York recorded in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, it was more than offset by higher opioid-related litigation expenses in corporate.","For the third quarter, we recorded net opioid-related adjusted operating expense of $20 million and year-to-date $81 million. For fiscal 2019, we continue to anticipate that opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million.","Turning back to our consolidated results. Adjusted income from operations was $918 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. We now anticipate adjusted income from operations will decline in the low single digit year-over-year.","Interest expense of $67 million in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, mainly driven by discrete tax benefits of $58 million resulting from tax planning initiatives and our mix of business.","For the full year, our adjusted tax rate assumption is approximately 17% to 19%. This guidance takes into account our latest assumptions regarding income mix as well as other onetime items in fiscal 2019 that we do not expect to reoccur.","Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $57 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $664 million, with third quarter adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share, which is flat compared to $3.41 in the prior year.","Wrapping up our consolidated results. Our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 195 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $500 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares for approximately 197 million for the year.","Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Slides 11 through 14. And let me start now with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $44.3 billion for the quarter, up 6%, driven by market growth, including strong growth in oncology-related pharmaceuticals and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses and branded to generic conversions.","The segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 2% to $593 million due to charges related to the customer bankruptcy discussed earlier and previously announced customer losses, partially offset by growth in our specialty business and the reversal of a charge related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act.","Excluding the impact of the customer bankruptcy-related charge and the reversal of the charge related to New York Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have seen year-over-year growth in segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter. Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 134 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points.","For the third quarter, brand compensation was in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we continue to be confident in our full year fiscal 2019 assumption, our brand price inflation in the U.S. to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range.","I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily of a fixed rate in nature. And as a result, our brand compensation is less impacted by brand price increases when compared to our historical experience.","For full year fiscal '19, we now anticipate a low to mid-single-digit percentage decline in adjusted operating profit for the segment. This represents an improvement from our prior expectations, driven by our third quarter operational performance.","Next, I'll review European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, down 1%, negatively impacted by $228 million from currency rate movements.","On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 2%, driven by strong performance outside of the U.K., partially offset by the previously disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and a challenging operating environment in the U.K. We now anticipate full year revenue for the segment will be flat compared to fiscal '18.","Segment adjusted operating profit was down 19% to $69 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $71 million. While our U.K. business was lower than the prior year, driven largely by the impact of the previously announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our retail business, the rest of Europe performed well, reflecting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 99 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 23 basis points. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year for the second half fiscal 2019 contribution, similar to what was reported in the first half of the year.","Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2 billion for the quarter, up 19%, driven by the Medical Specialty (sic) [Specialties] Distributors or MSD acquisition and solid market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 8%.","Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 21% to $170 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, improved cost of goods and operating expense leverage. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 845 basis points, an increase of 12 basis points.","We now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal '19 will be at the high end of our previously provided range of mid- to high single-digit percentage growth.","Finishing our business review with Other. Revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 1%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 5%, driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment. We now anticipate that full year revenues will be flat year-over-year.","Other adjusted operating profit was up 5% to $224 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $226 million, driven by growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business. We now anticipate that adjusted operating profit will grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the stronger-than-projected contribution from MRxTS.","Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $52 million for the quarter. As the company continues to make focused internal investments to expand new technologies, to enhance systems and deliver on synergy realization, we remain pleased with the operating performance of the business, which is in line with our expectations. And subject to market conditions, we continue to expect a calendar first half IPO.","Next, McKesson recorded $138 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 29% in constant currency year-over-year, driven primarily by opioid-related expenses. Due to higher-than-anticipated opioid-related expenses, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses to increase by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year.","Now that we wrapped up our results, let me discuss our updated fiscal 2019 outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share for fiscal 2019. Our updated outlook reflects the following: stronger-than-anticipated underlying performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, which includes the favorable ruling on the New York Opioid Stewardship Act; outperformance in our Medical-Surgical segment; and continued growth within our MRxTS business.","These positive developments are partially offset by the customer bankruptcy I previously discussed, higher opioid-related litigation expenses and an updated assumption that foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a negative impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share. We are well positioned to continue to execute in our fourth quarter.","I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on Slide 15. The receivables, days sales outstanding decreased 3 days to 24 days. Days sales in inventory decreased 1 day to 29 days. And days payables outstanding decreased 4 days in the prior year to 54 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $866 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.4 billion in common stock and paid $216 million in dividends.","During the quarter, McKesson issued $1.1 billion in long-term debt, which will be substantially used to repay an upcoming debt maturity, with approximately $1 billion in short-term borrowings outstanding at quarter-end.","McKesson generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $405 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $264 million. This result was in line with our expectations. In fiscal '19, we now expect internal capital investments at the low end of our previous range, between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion.","I'd remind you that typically during our fiscal third quarter, we experience a net use of cash, primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season. In addition, in our fiscal fourth quarter, we typically generate more than 2\/3 of our annual operating cash flow, with more than $3 billion generated in our final quarter 2 of the past 3 years.","We also have a total of $3.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which demonstrates the confidence that we have in our business going forward and the conviction that the Board of Directors and the management team have that the company shares are an attractive investment opportunity.","And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in April. Year-to-date fiscal 2019, we've returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, reflecting our focus on providing returns to our shareholders, while also making internal investments and acquisitions to support our long-term growth.","Let me now take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. As we announced earlier this month, McKesson has expanded its relationship with Genpact, the global professional services firm focused on delivering process transformation.","The expanded relationship will accelerate McKesson's operating model and cost structure program redesign, which will simplify and standardize finance processes, while deploying leading-edge technologies that will drive improved effectiveness, efficiency and savings.","This partnership in combination with other finance operating initiatives is expected to contribute up to 1\/4 of the previously announced annual gross pretax savings of $300 million to $400 million, which are anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect that these savings will increase gradually over time and that a majority of these savings will flow to the bottom line.","In closing, we are very pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter performance and the progress against our strategic priorities. Despite a non-anticipated customer charge, our results exceeded our expectations, demonstrating our commitment to operational execution.","Following solid third quarter performance, we now anticipate fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share. We look to build on the momentum of our third quarter and remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to fiscal '19.","Lastly, I'd also like to thank John for his outstanding leadership. We're very fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader. John has done a tremendous job leading the company for nearly 20 years. As we now turn the page to Brian, I'd echo John's comments that he made in the press release today. We're well positioned, and I believe we're in very strong hands going forward with Brian.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And from Evercore ISI, we have Ross Muken.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys and again John, congrats, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years. So I know you probably haven't had a ton of time to kind of digest and prepare, but there obviously was a number of things that came out after hours from HHS around rebates and antikickback. And so it looks like they're trying to push forward with some of the proposals we heard earlier in the year.","I guess, at a high level, I know this is something you feel strongly, you can sort of recruit the economics that goes into place. But I guess, how are you thinking about that in the context of just a disruptive force potentially, at least in the short term in the business, and how hard the government is going to push at least on this one piece?","Brian Tyler","Hey, Ross. It's Brian. Thanks for the question. I didn't see that flash across my e-mail screen as I walked into the conference room here. I thought we might get a question. First, let me say that we support programs that enhance access, quality and cost. And if we think about the wholesaler model and how our economics and the supply chain works, we're not directly predicated on the safe harbor in question.","Our economics really come from the manufacturer and revolve around the fair value of the services that we provide to them. We continue to believe that we run a highly efficient distribution and supply chain service and that they, over the years, have reinforced that view.","And through various evolutions in our market and our industry, we continue to be paid fair value for the services that we provide, and that's based on the conversations that we've been engaged in today. We continue to believe that, that will be the case. So I might also just comment that we are not just a supply chain company in terms of logistics, but a pretty sophisticated financial operation as well.","And on behalf of our manufacturers today, we administer lots of contract prices between manufacturers and hospitals or manufacturers and pharmacies. And millions of -- literally millions of price item customer combinations today, we do it at scale and we do it with great accuracy.","And in our pharmacy technology businesses that you heard Britt talk about in terms of their strong credit performance, we have very sophisticated at-scale pharmaceutical-related transactions, over 17 billion a year, connecting directly at the pharmacy counter.","So clearly, we will continue to engage in conversations with our manufacturer and other partners as people shift through the implications of what has just come out. But I focus you back on -- we continue to believe that we deliver a very important service in the pharmaceutical supply chain.","We continue to be paid for that service that has evolved over the years. We expect it will continue to evolve. But the net-net, we would expect we'll continue to be paid appropriately for the services that we provide.","Ross Muken","No, that's super helpful color. And just maybe relative to the quarter, is this -- I feel like all of the segments, sort of relative to your expectations, came in at least in line or maybe even a touch better in some places.","Do you feel like this is sort of evidence of, aside from some of these pieces that -- the hiccups that come now, again, like what happened with Shopko, aside from something unusual like that, the underlying trends in each of your businesses that leave sort of that worst or flat and maybe in some cases are certainly maybe even a touch better. And we're starting to see that bottoming that hopefully should be the jump-off for growth eventually in sort of the out years?","Brian Tyler","Well, we were certainly pleased with the operational performance of many of our businesses in the quarter. And as we've talked over the past months, we did see brand inflation come in line with where we had expected it to. That was a good development and provides some good underpinning for us.","We see the generic market as reaching some point of stabilization. It's always competitive, but it's competitive in the sense we feel confident, are comfortable historically.","And we do think that the focus that we've had over the past few months on the operating models and the discipline is beginning to resonate across our businesses. So I think I would say I feel real good about the quarter -- the operational quarter that the business put up.","Ross Muken","Thanks so much, Brian.","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","And moving on, we have Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","James Auh","Hi. This is James Auh for Charles. It looks like the MedSurg business performed better than at least we had expected, and the margins improved 12 basis points year-over-year.","Can you just talk more about what drove that margin expansion and maybe what gives you confidence to improve the outlook, as evidenced by your revised segment operating profit guidance?","Brian Tyler","Thanks for the question, James. And we were pretty pleased with medical business. I would characterize it as pretty solid performance really across the business. Most of our segments performed on or ahead of where we had expected them to. We performed well on the gross profit line. I think we saw them upside from expenses, and this is an environment where we're operating in a normalized flu season, where in a typical year, we would expect a little more tailwind from flu.","We're in more normal than, say, last year's really strong season. And I think part of it is just good execution. We're obviously continuing to benefit from the MSD acquisition.","And as we progress in the integration of the MSD acquisition, we feel good about the progress we're making, and it continues to be on track. So I look at the medical business and just feel a pretty solid performance really up and down the P&L.","John Hammergren","And I might just underpin that as I mentioned in my remarks, excluding the MSD acquisition, which Brian mentioned is performing well in terms of integration, grew at about 8% growth year-over-year.","So that's really solid for our growth within the ongoing business really across that business. So 8%, excluding MSD, I think it really underpins Brian's comments about the solid performance of that segment.","James Auh","Okay. Great. And also can you maybe talk about the reimbursement environment in the U.K.? Do you get any sense of visibility into any incremental cuts?","John Hammergren","Well, as I've mentioned in past comments, we always expect some level of reimbursement headwind. We have experienced in the prior few years abnormally high headwinds, I would say. That's clearly challenged the business.","If I think about the current reimbursement landscape, there were -- the NHS typically does a 3-year plan, and this is the third year of the plan, and that plan would have called for them to push through some pharmacy-specific cuts, which they elected to not do, which we took as a mild positive that the NHS in tune with the landscape of community pharmacy in the U.K.","Obviously, they've come out with the 10-year -- the NHS England's 10-year plan and community pharmacy was highlighted in that plan as having an important role in addressing cost, access and quality for them. This -- just this week, yesterday or maybe even this morning, in fact, NHS announced some incremental funding into the provision of community health around GPs, but also including other health care professionals, which we think just continues to reinforce their view of the importance of community provision of health and addressing the cost challenges of NHS.","We're still digesting a lot of that. And I would not want to ever declare a victory on the reimbursement front, just given recent experience. But we would like to think that we've probably gone through the most significant of that.","Now it's really a matter of how we continue to evolve the retail pharmacy model and to be a more integrated part of health care delivery in the communities in England.","James Auh","Great. Thank you.","John Hammergren","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, from JPMorgan we have Lisa Gill.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. John, I sincerely want to wish you the very best. I hope you enjoy time with your family. I may be the only one on the call today that has been on all 79 earnings calls with you from the beginning. So I will truly miss you, as you know. My question would be, though, Brian, you made a couple of comments.","One, you talked about the Q3 being ahead of the internal expectations. Was there anything that was pulled forward from Q4? Because you also made a comment that the early indication of feeling good about where you stand for Q4.","So I just want to understand if there was anything, #1, that was pulled forward? And then secondly, as we think about the fourth quarter, if there's any moving parts? Because if I look at the new revised guidance, it does come in kind of towards the lower end of where the Street is on the midpoint.","Brian Tyler","Yes, thank you, Lisa. I'll may be make a couple of remarks and then let Britt add some color. Just with regards to the performance of the business in Q3, I think I characterize it as pretty solid and feeling good across many of our businesses. I don't believe there was any unique pull forward, or I think of it as just core solid operating performance.","Britt Vitalone","And Lisa, maybe what I would add to that, I agree with everything that Brian said. As we think about Q4 and one of the things that I mentioned in my remarks is really around branded price inflation.","And although we've talked a bit more of our branded, compensation is about 95% now fixed in nature and less variable, there still is that contingent part obviously that we've talked about briefly at JPMorgan. We feel comfortable on our mid-single-digit range. And again, we had very strong performance that we believe will continue in through Q4.","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we have Eric Percher with Nephron Research.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Congrats to John and many thanks to Craig. For Brian and Britt, the question on opioids. I think the first part is, relative -- you've given some of the solutions that McKesson has taken part in. I'd be interested, Brian, to hear your perspective on the role that McKesson or a distributor plays and maybe some of the responsibility or limitations of responsibility that distributor should hold?","And then, Britt, a $100 million in legal expense, that's a significant number. Is there a lot of early stage work, and will that ever inflow? Or is that where we're going to be for foreseeable future?","Brian Tyler","I'll take the first part of your question, Eric. And as you well know, it's -- the health care supply chains are incredibly complicated with lots of actors playing various different roles. I mean, as it particularly relates to opioid, we get the products to DEA-licensed pharmacies.","They fulfill those based on scripts written by DEA-licensed physicians. And the DEA itself even controls the overall quantity of opioids in the marketplace. And so while we have a role in that physical supply chain, I would say that we would -- we feel like a disproportionate amount of the attention has been placed on wholesalers to this point.","Britt Vitalone","Eric, I'll take your second question. Again, we've updated our guidance on the opioid litigation costs. And again, we -- our best view on it right now is that it'll be in excess of $100 million for the year. I think it's challenging for us to really have visibility on what the cost could be over the longer term. These costs have continued to increase over the balance of this year.","And I think as we think about going forward, projecting the cost going forward will be difficult. It will depend on a lot of different things. Decisions that the judge will make in the various cases, how the judge will schedule certain milestones in each of the cases.","It is very difficult for us to predict how each of those situations will play out. So we'll continue to update you as we go forward. And what we've given you now is our best projection on those costs for at least for this year.","Brian Tyler","And we do take this responsibility in a very serious way. At this point, where we are, we think it's very important that we invest in the legal defense, that we get the best lawyers to represent us in that defense.","And as Britt said, it's very difficult to predict where and how and when these things will evolve. But our commitment is to be good stewards of the capital that you have invested in us, and we will continue to keep you updated as the process unfolds.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we have Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on CVS on that contract. I mean, what are your expectations around the ability to retain the current services that you provide them? And then what are your thoughts on any additional services that you can provide -- yes, additional services that you can add to the contract?","Brian Tyler","Thanks, Brian. I'll start with we have a long-standing relationship with CVS. We've been long time partners. And we think that we service their business to the highest standards and levels that can be found in the industry. So we value and appreciate the relationship we've had with them over the years, and we would fully expect that we will continue that relationship.","We are in discussions with them currently around the renewal and extension of that agreement. And like we've said many times, I think if you look at the industry, there's a pretty good track record of renewing these.","And certainly for McKesson, we feel very strongly that our track record of renewing and maintaining these relationships is strong, other than the occasional loss from the acquisition-related activity.","We think CVS well respects the work their associates do on their behalf. And so we enter into these discussions. We have every full expectation to renew it. Now we often talk about CVS as the big customer for the U.S. Pharma business, and that certainly is true.","We also have relationships with them in our RelayHealth and some other parts of the company as well. So it's a pretty big broad comprehensive relationship overall, and we're optimistic that we will continue that relationship.","Brian Tanquilut","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Michael Cherny with Bank of America.","Michael Cherny","Great. Thanks so much for the color today. I know it's addressed earlier in terms of the HHS and the rebate rule. I'm not expecting, as you said, a view on this. I think we've asked this question in the past, but when you talk about going back and making sure you get the appropriate compensation, what else goes into the conversation in terms of, is this creating an opportunity with your customers to explore new services, to pitch them on some of these things, whether it's CoverMyMeds and some of the other areas that they haven't passed me over the past?","Are there others services that they're throwing back and asking you to try and pursue over time? Just trying to understand if a situation like this with uncertainty around how the pricing paradigms going to play out for pricing as a whole could create incremental strategic opportunities for the company that historically has been pretty active on the M&A front.","Brian Tyler","Yes, great. Thank you for that question. As I -- we think about addressing an issue like this. And when I think about health care, it's pretty fundamentally connected upstream, downstream.","I mean, whether it's employers, payers, PBMs, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, it's a pretty interconnected system. And we're fortunate in McKesson that really have businesses, solutions and relationships across multiple of those constituents.","So we tend to talk on these calls a lot about the dialogues we have with manufacturers, but we certainly have dialogues with those other constituent customers as well.","And I think one of the great strengths of McKesson is breadth of reach that we have and the capabilities we have, including some unique capabilities like CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth, which we would think there is good potential for some opportunities. It's contingent, of course, on how this evolves.","But when we meet with our partners, whether that's upstream or downstream, we try to bring the fully capability and complement of McKesson into those discussions, not to let it get narrowly focused on just one piece.","Michael Cherny","Thanks.","Operator","And next from Leerink, we have David Larsen.","David Larsen","Hi. Congrats on the good quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the Rite Aid renewal? Are those renewal rates reflected in this quarter's results or the new guidance for fiscal '19? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about the sell-side market environment as it relates to generic pricing? Thanks a lot.","John Hammergren","David, thanks for that question. I'll start, and then I'll Brian jump in. As we've talked about before, we were very pleased obviously with renegotiating or renewing Rite Aid for a longer period of time. We think that there's strategic opportunities for both of us. As we've also said, this was renewed within our guidance. So there will be -- with the guidance that we gave you today includes the renewal with Rite Aid.","David Larsen","Is it in the quarter? Is it fully reflected in the quarter, this quarter?","John Hammergren","Fully reflected in our numbers, in our results, yes.","David Larsen","Okay, great. And then can you may be just touch on generic deflation? Like how is that trending relative to expectations without getting too specific? One of your peers said mid-single to high single-digit deflation rates is what they're seeing. Is that what you're seeing as well or...","John Hammergren","Yes, we don't give specific ranges on the rates of generic deflation. But as Brian mentioned, we're seeing a more stable or more normalized environment around generics. Again, I think it's important to look at both the sell-side as well as the buy-side.","On the sell-side, we are seeing a competitive marketplace, as we've seen for many years. And then we expect that to continue, but we're seeing a very stable environment.","And then on the buy-side, we're very pleased with the performance that we have at ClarusONE. We think that, that entity is still performing quite well and it is providing us the opportunity to continue to work very closely with the manufacturers.","And we think that the buy-side environment is more normal in terms of historical ranges, and it's a more stable environment than it has been several quarters ago. So we're very pleased with the environment that we're in. It's a competitive environment, but a more stable one.","David Larsen","Thanks. I appreciate it.","Operator","Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Hi, good evening and John and Craig wishing you all the best and enjoy your time. And Brian and Holly, I'm looking forward to working with both of you. So Craig, this might be a question for you other than to congratulate you. When you think about it -- I know earlier in the call, you said that you're going to focus only on fiscal year '19.","But I do note that starting next week, starting Monday, most of the questions we're going to get will be on fiscal year '20. So just if you can just help us think about this factor that we should consider -- I mean, obviously there is Rite Aid and CVS that you already talked about, which are likely to be headwinds next year. But how should we think about any other factors that we should consider, any other tailwind that you -- we factor in as we think about next year?","Craig Mercer","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. Maybe another call, you can congratulate me on something.","Ricky Goldwasser","I hope that you have a long tenure going ahead.","Craig Mercer","Thanks for that. So I think as we've talked about, we're very pleased with the quarter, and there's a lot of things that both Brian and I outlined and we view as providing momentum as we go into Q4. And certainly, we feel very strongly about as we move forward.","We talked about our medical business and we had very good performance in our medical business, not only from the acquisition of MSD, but the rest of the business performed quite well also.","We talked a little bit about our McKesson Prescription Technology business, and we were certainly seeing good -- new product growth as well as good revenue growth in that business. And then our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, again, as we talked about, we had the customer charge in the quarter.","Outside of that customer charge and the reversal from the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have had growth in the quarter. And so we feel that there's really strong growth underneath in that business as well.","So there is a number of areas in our business that are performing quite well. We certainly feel good about the position that we're in as we close the third quarter and as we have momentum going into the fourth quarter. Those will be a few of the areas that I would point out to you right now.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. So nothing in '20. So let me ask you another question here. The -- obviously, the health care market is changing and may be faster than we'll anticipate and we would appreciate heading into this year.","So Brian, from your perspective, as you look ahead, as you look at, matter of fact, your first year as a CEO of the business, what do you think is kind of like the one area or maybe the 2 areas that are going to be your top priorities?","Or where you think that you're going to spend most of your time on? There's the opioids. There is -- obviously, the relationship with the manufacturers, a number of different things. So from your perspective, what are really kind of like the things that your key priorities will be?","Brian Tyler","Yes. Thank you for the question. It certainly is a dynamic time in our industry. And we often, I think in these calls, focus on clouds. And the fact of the matter is, when I look at McKesson and I look at the breadth of the businesses we have, I look at the reach in the channels, I look at the positioning in the community-based channels and the capabilities whether they're supply chain, whether they're software, pharmaceutical transaction or Medical-Surgical related, I think we've got this a tremendously broad set of assets and capabilities, unbelievably talented teams.","And that change creates great opportunities for companies like ours that can bring these assets together in unique and differentiated ways on behalf of biopharma partners, on behalf of provider customers. I think to me that's the really exciting part of it, and that's the real opportunity that lies ahead.","And so that's where I'll be spending my time, with our partners upstream, downstream and with our teams that are dedicated on delivering the value to those partners in and out every day.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you. And congrats, again.","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Ricky.","Brian Tyler","One last question?","Operator","All right. So the final question from Goldman Sachs, we have Robert Jones.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in John. Wish you the best Craig. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I guess, Brian, just going back to this idea that you discussed that there are services that you are the wholesaler, provide for hospitals and other channels that aren't currently being leveraged in the retail channel.","I heard something obviously very similar from one of your peers this morning. Obviously, the HSS news seems to be kind of pushing us towards this kind of net pricing world, which seems to play a part in this.","Could you maybe just level set us and maybe just elaborate a little bit on what specifically the services are, that changing or current pricing dynamic would allow for a wholesaler to leverage into the core channel?","Brian Tyler","I think - the reality is we're going to see how things evolve here and how various constituents respond to the proposal that's been laid out. What I feel good about when I think about the capabilities at McKesson, and I mentioned this in my comments, is the fact that we do financial transactions, we do pharmaceutical transactions today in various parts of our business at scale with high accuracy, with really mature, developed, established incredible reputation for performance around those.","And so I do think, as we looked how the markets will respond, how various segments will respond, we are in a good position to be able to provide solutions, kind of whatever that evolution is.","Robert Jones","Thank you very much.","Brian Tyler","Thanks, Robert. And thank you, Craig. I'd like to thank all of those of you on the call with us for your time today. I certainly look forward to engaging with you and the rest of our investor community going forward. I want to acknowledge John one last time, thank him one last time for just the terrific career accomplishment and the impression he has left on me and that I know he's left all across the teams of McKesson. He'll be greatly missed.","I want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our ICARE value of putting the patient and the customers first in everything we do.","In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2020 outlook in a few months' time. I'll now hand the call back to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?","Craig Mercer","Thank you, Brian. On Thursday, February 28, we will present at Leerink Partners 8th Annual Global Healthcare Conference in New York, and we look forward to releasing our fourth quarter earnings results in early May."],"14188":["McKesson (NYSE:MCK) Q4 2013 Earnings Call May  7, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Erin Lampert","John H.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments.

Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2013 results, available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter and full year that reflects strong operating performance across all businesses in our Distribution Solutions segment. We generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow for the year, capping off another great year of cash flow performance. In addition to completing our acquisition of PSS World Medical in the fourth quarter, we repurchased shares valued at $800 million, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to just over $1.2 billion.","As we discussed in our third quarter earnings conference call, we have anticipated the challenge of the low level of new generic launches in our industry and its affect on McKesson in fiscal 2014. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we took a number of strategic and operational actions to position the company for fiscal 2014 and beyond.","Today, we also provided fiscal 2014 guidance of $7.90 to $8.20 per diluted share from continuing operations, reflecting solid growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, aided by the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the challenges we anticipated as we head into fiscal 2014, I believe we have a plan that balances investment for the future and delivering solid financial returns for our shareholders.","To summarize our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 results, I'm pleased by the strong performance in Distribution Solutions, with all businesses performing ahead of their operating plan for the year. I'm also proud of the strong cash flow and balance sheet, which continue to provide us continued opportunities to create value for our shareholders through our portfolio approach to capital deployment.","While the actions we took in the fourth quarter lowered our financial results, I believe we, as a management team, have a responsibility to regularly evaluate our strategy and ensure we position the company for long-term success. Let me step back for a moment and provide some context for the strategic and operational actions we took in the fourth quarter.","I would remind you that, on the January earnings call, we talked about a number of actions we plan to take to position the company for the challenges we face in 2014 and beyond. I'll put these actions into 3 broad categories: First, in our Distribution Solutions segment, we completed a strategic evaluation of our minority investment in Nadro, a privately held pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico, where we have a 49% equity interest, and we made the decision to exit our minority investment in this business.","Second, we realigned the structure in our Technology Solutions segment during the fourth quarter, to focus in the areas where we have a leading position, improve our efficiency and enhance our ability to continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. As one part of the broader realignment of Technology Solutions, today we announced our intention to exit our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. While both of these business have made important contributions to McKesson over the years, they no longer fit with our evolving focus.","Finally, we have taken a number of smaller actions across our business to help us meet this short-term challenge, while ensuring our company remains well positioned for the long-term. These actions drove various severance and facility exit charges across both segments and within our corporate group.","Through many years of change in our company and in our industry, McKesson has remain committed to our customers' success. We understand clearly that our own performance and growth must be constant, focused and determined if we are to continue to distinguish ourselves for our customers.","Now turning to the broader industry environment. Health care topics remain in the national spotlight. Federal and state governments continue to struggle with near-term budget challenges and the longer-term imperative of implementing meaningful health reforms. Reimbursement changes continue to have an impact across the health care industry, with the impact to medical oncology reimbursement drawing recent widespread attention. McKesson is very engaged in advocating on behalf of our oncology physician partners and customers to reinforce the value of community oncology practices across the country. We continue to believe our U.S. oncology model is particularly well positioned to succeed in an environment seeking the highest quality care and the best outcomes at the lowest cost.","","The pharmaceutical supply chain continues to evolve with new partnerships and new ideas for addressing global markets. While all health care markets are ultimately local, McKesson has been working globally for many years. Our sourcing expertise and the strength of our relationships with manufacturers across the globe have allowed us to drive efficiencies for our pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical customers. Those customers have, in turn, rewarded McKesson with their continued trust and their partnership as we grow and expand with them.","Our customers have urgent needs to improve their processes, reduce their costs and meet increasing regulatory demands. They are looking for a strong partner who can help drive solutions across all of these dimensions. At McKesson, it is the strength and breadth of our products and services, our ability to leverage our significant scale and our broad technology capability that continues to differentiate us with our customers.","Now moving on to some of the business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Strong execution in all of our businesses in Distribution Solutions drove full year operating results for the company. Once again, U.S. pharmaceutical delivered outstanding results for the year. In fiscal 2013, we experienced the largest number of brand-to-generic conversions our industry has ever seen, and I'm proud of the performance of our U.S. pharmaceutical business during this unprecedented year.","During fiscal 2013, we expanded our total generic pharmaceutical business through continued penetration of our customer base, demonstrating the significant value we deliver through our generics programs. And I'm pleased with the growth and progress in our private label generics business. Due to the size and sophistication of our Global Sourcing capabilities, we also successfully launched our private label generics into the Canadian market in fiscal 2013. A significant accomplishment for the U.S. pharmaceutical team in the fiscal year was the opening of our new state-of-the-art regional distribution center, which continues our long track record of investment in creating the most efficient and effective operating infrastructure in the industry.","During the year, we were very pleased to renew a considerable portion of our business in U.S. pharmaceutical. I believe the value we demonstrate year-in and year-out is one of the core reasons we are privileged to have long-standing relationships with our customers. We also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation and return.","In summary, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our U.S. pharmaceutical businesses in fiscal 2013. I believe this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success.","Turning to our other businesses in Distribution Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results, with 15% growth in revenues in fiscal 2013. Solid organic growth and growth from new customers, along with the completion of our acquisition of PSS in February of this year, all contributed to this terrific result.","I'm very pleased to welcome Gary Corless and his talented team from PSS to McKesson. While we are still in the early phase of the integration with PSS, I'm very encouraged by the conversations I've had with the integration team, leaders in our business and our sales force and our customers. As with any acquisition of this size and scale, there will be synergies we anticipate in the relatively early stages and other synergies that will take longer to capture. We've assembled a great team to lead this effort, and all of them are passionate about what we can do on behalf of our customers going forward.","Our Canadian Distribution business had a solid year and continues to grow its contribution to the overall operating performance of the Distribution Solutions segment. Through consistent execution and innovation, our team in Canada has continued to find ways to grow their operating results. Our business has grown not only as a result of our customers' growth, but also through winning new customers who are looking for a strong partner with a long track record of performance. Our business in Canada continues to perform very well, and I believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of growth in fiscal 2014.","Finally, our Specialty business delivered solid financial results by making steady progress in the areas of patient care, growth in the number of physicians who are part of the U.S. oncology network and advances in technology deployed to physicians to assist them in providing better care to their patients.","The impact of the sequester on medical oncology reimbursement, which took effect on April 1, has received particular attention over the past month. Now more than ever, both independent oncologists practicing in the community setting and oncologists practicing as part of hospital-affiliated groups need a strong partner who can help them improve their efficiency. With our expertise in managing the business and information technology needs of the oncology care process in the community and hospital settings, the value proposition of U.S. oncology is stronger than ever.","Through our U.S. oncology model, which encompasses a full suite of integrated cancer care, including medical oncology, radiation oncology and surgery centers, our team at McKesson specialty health has a deep understanding of the dynamics of community oncology practices. We continue to innovate for our customers, leverage the scale and sourcing expertise of McKesson and provide a compelling value proposition that allows us to grow our business with existing customers and win new customers. This business is performing well, and we expect it will continue this coming fiscal year.","","Overall, I'm is extremely pleased with our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. As we look ahead to fiscal 2014, in particular, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will rebound significantly for the year as brand-to-generic conversions slow, our existing customers continue to grow and we have a full year result of the acquisition of PSS.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 3% to $3.4 billion. Full year adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $371 million. Fourth quarter results include the impact of an impairment charge and the costs associated with the realignment of our business in Technology Solutions, which I'll come back to in just a moment. The results of Technology Solutions were below our expectations. We are making a number of changes in the segment to focus in the areas where we have a leading position, and invest in the opportunities where we can innovate for our customers.","So let me walk through a few of those to get our focus in the most -- majority part of our effort. Since Pat Blake assumed the leadership for our Technology Solutions segment in 2009, we've been focused on a strategy to improve the performance of our core technology businesses and invest in new growth opportunities. We've made progress toward our goals over the past several years, and the changes we announced today are the next step toward positioning our Technology Solutions segment for the future.","We've expanded our capabilities in our RelayHealth and McKesson Health Solutions businesses. In addition to the strength in both of these businesses, we have positioned McKesson to lead in the emerging areas of population health, analytics, value-based reimbursement and connectivity, all areas critical to our customers as they look to the future. Beyond the newly expanded RelayHealth and McKesson Health Solutions, the remaining assets in Technology Solutions have been organized around 3 business areas: our leading medical imaging software franchise, our newly combined ambulatory services and software business, and our electronic health record and revenue cycle solutions.","I believe the steps we have taken to further focus our efforts in Technology Solutions leverages the strengths in our portfolio, and allows us to optimize our R&D investments in support of our critically emerging requirements our customers will face over the next several years. Looking forward to fiscal 2014, we expect Technology Solutions revenue growth will accelerate from the level of growth seen in 2013, driven primarily by the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2013, and we expect operating margins at Technology Solutions will rebound strongly in fiscal 2014.","In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically, to enable better business, better care and better connectivity.","Before I end, I will spend a few moments talking about capital deployment. We are in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $2 billion in fiscal 2014. Over time, we've used our portfolio approach to capital deployment for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investments, creating significant value for our shareholders. And we expect to continue our portfolio approach as we head into fiscal 2014.","To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan as we enter fiscal 2014 that reflects growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, aided by the continued strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.90 to $8.20.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone.  As you just heard, this was another quarter of strong operating performance in Distribution  Solutions, capping off a great year of operating performance in this segment. We also had another great year of cash flow and deployed a record amount of capital in the fourth quarter, which contributed significantly to the positive outlook we have for fiscal 2014. Looking forward, we believe that the strategic and operational actions we took in the March quarter better position us for both FY '14 and for the years beyond.","In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. As you know, we provide our guidance on an annual basis, due to both the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability that is inherent in many of our businesses. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus more today on the annual numbers than the quarterly ones, and I will also comment on what the trends we see in the annual numbers for FY '13 might mean for fiscal 2014.","My comments today will also focus on our full year FY '13 adjusted EPS of $6.33, which as you recall, excludes 3 types of well-defined items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and certain litigation reserve adjustments. So it is important to note that this full year adjusted EPS of $6.33 includes the impact of the strategic business realignment actions that we took in the March quarter, which are partly a response to the challenges John and I discussed on our January earnings call. These actions collectively resulted in $0.76 of impairment charges and $0.11 of severance and facility exit charges, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter.","So let me start by sorting through these charges. To simplify, our fourth quarter charges, all of which flowed through both our GAAP and adjusted earnings, are made up of 3 items. First, we recorded $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge, or roughly $0.58 of EPS, in our Distribution Solutions segment in the fourth quarter related to our decision to sell our minority investment in Nadro. We called this $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge out in our press tables, immediately below the Other Income line. Second, as part of our recent business structure realignment in Technology Solutions, we recorded $46 million of noncash pretax impairment charges or roughly $0.18 of EPS in the Technology Solutions segment, $36 million of which flowed through the operating expense line. Third, as part of our broader company-wide efforts to offset the headwind of significantly lower generic launches in fiscal 2014, we recorded severance and facility exit charges of $35 million or $0.11 of EPS, spread fairly evenly across both operating segments in the fourth quarter.","So with these charges behind us, let's now turn to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B. Consolidated revenues were relatively flat for the full year and down 3% for the quarter. The story behind our revenue performance has been the same all year, as our revenue growth was slowed by the record number of brand-to-generic conversions that occurred in  fiscal 2013. Notably, as we look forward to the fiscal 2014, we expect a significant pivot here because of the steep decline in brand-to-generic conversions in FY '14. Through the combination of this sizable slowdown in generic launches and our recent acquisitions, we expect to see significant revenue growth return in fiscal 2014 in both segments.","Now as you've heard me say many times before, while generic drugs have a deflationary impact on our top line growth, they certainly are a good thing financially for our company. You see this in our full year adjusted gross profit growth of 6%, as our economics are better on generic drugs.","Total adjusted operating expenses for the full year were up 8% to $4.4 billion. Our full year adjusted operating expenses were higher, primarily driven by 3 factors: recent acquisitions contributed $136 million of additional adjusted operating expense; the RAMQ charge, recorded in the third quarter in our Canadian business, added another $40 million; and the fourth quarter noncash Technology Solutions impairment charge added $36 million. When you exclude these 3 items, our full year adjusted operating expenses were up roughly 3% versus the prior year. This is probably the best reflection of what we would expect for our total company adjusted operating expense in fiscal 2014, before adding in the significant additional adjusted operating expenses from our recent acquisitions.","Other income for the full year was $35 million. As a reminder, this line is primarily driven by our interest income and also includes the pluses and minuses on various other investments. Generally, we don't expect material changes in this line from year to year. Full year adjusted interest expense decreased $22 million versus the prior year, to $229 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt back in February 2012.","Looking ahead, we did raise $1.8 billion of new debt in the last half of fiscal 2013, and we enter fiscal 2014 with our gross debt-to-capital ratio at 40.8%, placing us at the top end of our current target leverage range. In a commentary on the current low interest rate environment, however, we expect our year-over-year interest expense in fiscal 2014 to be fairly flat despite the increase in our debt.","Moving down the P&L to taxes. We ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 31.3%, which is slightly higher than the adjusted tax rate guidance we provided on our Q3 earnings call of 30.5%. The higher rate was driven by a number of discrete items and a slightly less favorable mix of income. Looking forward, our fiscal 2014 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, although it may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the full year was $1.5 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.33. As a reminder, this full year adjusted EPS of $6.33 includes the $0.76 of impairment charges and $0.11 of severance and facility exit charges taken in the fourth quarter.","To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 5% year-over-year, to 239 million, in line with our original guidance. Going forward, mainly driven by the magnitude of the share repurchases we did in the fourth quarter of FY '13, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2014 is 231 million.","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions total revenues were flat for the full year and down 4% for the quarter. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues increased 2% for the full year and 1% for the quarter. Full year and fourth quarter direct revenues increased primarily due to market growth, which was offset by the record number of brand-to-generic conversions in FY '13. As John mentioned earlier, for fiscal 2014, we anticipate direct revenue growth will rebound significantly, driven by the slowing of brand-to-generic conversions and aided by above market growth that we expect from a handful of our largest existing customers.","Warehouse revenues declined 9% for the full year and 26% for the quarter. As we discussed over the past several quarters, warehouse revenues are particularly impacted by brand-to-generic conversions. In addition, relative to our original expectations, in FY '13, we saw a shift of existing customer business from warehouse to Direct Store Delivery, which actually is a very good thing for our bottom line, as we have higher margins in the direct revenues.","Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis decreased 2% for the full year and 5% for the quarter. As a reminder, the prior year benefited from having 5 extra sales days in fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter, in addition to the impact we have seen all year from the ongoing generic price reduction challenges in Canada, we were going through a transition with one of our largest Canadian customers. Looking forward to fiscal 2014, we'll complete the customer transition while also benefiting from some recent new customer wins. As a result, we expect to return to significant revenue growth in this business in FY '14, as our team continues to do a great job overcoming the challenging generics regulatory environment.","Medical-Surgical revenues were up 15% for the full year and up 37% for the quarter. When you exclude the impact of the PSS acquisition, our fourth quarter revenues increased approximately 10% versus the prior year and our full year revenues increased a healthy 8%, driven by market growth and new customers. We are very pleased with all of these revenue growth numbers, and they provide a strong foundation for fiscal 2014 as we set about the hard work of integrating these 2 great businesses.  I would say that our expected view of the PSS first full year operating performance remains unchanged from the initial comments we made on our Q2 earnings call.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 8% for the full year on flat revenues, resulting in a nice improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating expense for this segment increased 10% for the full year, driven by the business acquisitions we've made over the past year and the $40 million RAMQ pretax charge in our Canadian business. When you factor out these 2 items, our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 4% versus the prior year.","As reported on Schedule 3B, Distribution Solutions full year adjusted operating profit declined 2% to $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with an adjusted operating margin rate of 207 basis points. I do want to remind you that this full year adjusted operating margin rate, 207 basis points, includes the fourth quarter $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge for Nadro.  Looking forward, in fiscal year 2014, we would expect mid-single-digit basis point growth off this FY '13 adjusted operating margin of 207 basis points.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 3% for the full year to $3.4 billion. As noted on Schedule 3B, our full year adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $371 million, and our full year adjusted operating margin rate was 10.91%. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 9% for the full year. And here again, you see the impact of the acquisitions we have made over the past year, as the acquisitions accounted for approximately 3 points of this growth. In addition, $36 million of the fourth quarter asset impairment charges related to the business realignment were recorded in the operating expense line. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the year was $492 million, up 9% compared to $451 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, our capitalization rate remained unchanged at 8%.","For fiscal 2014, we expect revenue growth in Technology Solutions to be similar to what we experienced in FY '13, before adding in for FY '14 the impact of the various acquisitions we have done. And we expect to be within the low end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Let me remind you that our financial statements include PSS' entire balance sheet of March 31, 2013, but only 5 weeks of sales for the quarter. As a result, it's more relevant to discuss our working capital metrics, excluding PSS. For receivables, our days sales outstanding, excluding PSS, increased by 1 day versus the prior year to 25 days. Our days sales in inventory of 32 days was up 2 days from a year ago, and our days sales in payables increased to 50 days from 49 days last year, all when you exclude PSS. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Echoing John's earlier comments, this is at the high end of our original guidance range and is an outstanding result.","Our capital structure remains a source of financial strength and earnings growth, and we enter fiscal 2014 with continued financial flexibility. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2014.","Internal capital spending was $406 million for the year, slightly below our original expectations. You will see our fiscal 2014 guidance assumes an internal capital spending range between $400 million and $450 million.","Before I conclude, let me provide a few last bits of context for our fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $7.90 to $8.20 per diluted share. In today's press release, we called out the key guidance assumptions underlying our fiscal 2014 plan, so I won't comment further on most of these assumptions. I would note that one of these key assumptions has always listed the various items not contemplated in the guidance we issued today, such as the impact of any litigation reserve adjustments or the impact of any potential new acquisitions. For FY '14, we are adding LIFO to this list, as the slowdown in brand-to-generic conversions last year could result in LIFO adjustments in FY '14.","","Last, I would point out one other item that will impact our fiscal 2014 GAAP and adjusted earnings results. As discussed in today's press release and throughout this earnings call, we have announced our intention to exit our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the results of these businesses will be reported as discontinued operations.","So in summary, I've tried, as we've gone through our results, to help you understand how our FY '13 performance supports our fiscal 2014 planned guidance. As always with any plan, there are risks, but we enter fiscal 2014 pleased with the plan we have for the coming year and optimistic about our prospects.","Thanks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones, if I could. John, in your sort of prepared remarks, you talked about the health care IT business, and I think you suggested that revs would be up based on some recent acquisitions. But I think you also suggested that the margins would rebound strongly in that business. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that improved profitability in that segment.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Glen, for the question. I think certainly the first thing is we won't have some of the onetime events that are flowing through our adjusted earnings. We talked about some of the changes we did at the end of the year here that caused that to happen. We also don't expect some of the issues we had in the businesses that we plan to put it into discontinued operations, obviously it won't be in part of our adjusted earnings going forward. And probably third and most important, I think we're regaining some of our momentum in these businesses and hope that we will experience a nice margin lift, because of positive mix change and because of just a more focused and performance-oriented process into this year's plan.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up on the distribution segment and, Jeff, I want to make sure I kind of heard you correctly. We're looking for improved revenue growth in drug distribution due to the factors you kind of talked about. And I thought you said maybe for the operating profit assumption, we'd be up mid- to high-single digit basis points off of an adjusted number in the base year because of the impairment. Did I hear that correctly?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, let me be very clear. So if you look at FY '13, Glen, you see a 207 basis point margin rate in Distribution Solutions for the year, and that does include the Nadro impairment. As we look at FY '14, we'd expect a mid-single-digit basis point improvement off that 207. And I think what's important to realize here are 2 things. Number one, that, as we've been talking about for a very long time, you have a really unprecedented 1 year drop, in our fiscal year, in the number of brand-to-generic conversions, and that is a significant impact on our margin rate. Sort of related is you have tremendous growth returning on the revenue line, particularly around brand and particularly where we expect even a little above-market growth from some of our largest existing customers, where the business is mostly brand. So you have really factored into that margin rate assumption for FY '14, both the brand-to-generic conversion downside and the fact that you're going to have a big revenue number that obviously has a dampening effect on the margins.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","We've been hearing a lot about creating global scale recently, and you just exited Mexico, obviously, one particular market. But do you think that you need to go global to further improve your sourcing?","John H. Hammergren","I think that we generally don't comment on our market expansion plans, and we have and will continue to consider many strategic options, both within and outside the United States. And as in the past, we'll pursue those options and find the ones that drive the most value for our shareholders. I think we have significant scale today. And clearly, our sourcing programs are quite significant. And we think we have very good relationships. And we have been working globally for many years to drive efficiencies and source private-label products for our pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical supply customers. So in the end, we think we have very significant scale today and terrific sourcing capabilities and expertise that we refined over decades, actually. And I believe we're doing a great job for our customers and we'll remain very well positioned. But does not mean that we're not going to continue to evolve and innovate for the future. And the partnership you refer to, that was recently announced, is an important industry move, but it's not going to change our strategy. And at the same time, however, our management philosophy is that, in order to keep our leadership position, we have to constantly evolve and be open to new approaches and ideas.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Ricky, I'd also, just on the specific question of Mexico, remind you that this is a minority investment for us, where we had no management control or position. And it's probably not so much a commentary on the market as it is just on the fact that the governance didn't work for us.","John H. Hammergren","And I would say, in follow up to that, the governance in Canada has worked for us in our ability to leverage our skills, across both the U.S. and Canada it's proven to be quite effective. So I think had we, perhaps, had a different position in Mexico, we would have had a different result.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify on the margin question, so when we back up the charges and the benefit, we get to operating profit margin of around 3.07% in Distribution segment for the quarter, so very nice expansion. So I just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about that number correctly. And then as we think about fiscal year '14 guidance, I think the reported number was 2.07%. Once we back off that, we get back of the envelope to around 2.20%, 2.22%. Should we use that number as we model fiscal year '14?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, to be clear on fiscal year '14, Ricky, what we're saying is, off the 207 number for FY '13, we would expect mid-single-digit basis point growth, because of the very significant dampening impact of a rebound in revenue growth and the drop-off in brand-to-generic conversions.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And that's includes already the positive margin contribution from PSS?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Correct.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, I just wanted to follow up on some of your thoughts on the overall distribution market right now. I mean, clearly, there's been a number of changes in contracts over the last several months. You've renewed your contract with CVS. But can you maybe just give us some of your thoughts around the overall competitive and pricing environment today?","John H. Hammergren","Sure, Lisa. I see a market that is competitive today, just as it has always been, I guess. And while there has been some attention recently to some of these big customer switches in the industry, I think we've been very pleased to have renewed a large portion of McKesson's U.S. pharmaceutical business headed into this fiscal '14. And those renewals are actually more of our base than we typically would experience in a typical year. So we're quite pleased that we have continued to renew those partnerships. And I think it's really based on our broad capabilities and our track record for driving substantial financial efficiencies for our customers. It is terrific service levels, and I mentioned the fact that we're opening up our renewed or replacement RDC, which is going to be, I think, a continued big hit for our customers. And I think our customers have continued to choose us because we provide the best value proposition on a myriad of dimensions. And so I'm quite pleased with it and I think we're quite optimistic as it relates to, at least, our position with our customers going into the next fiscal year.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just as my follow up, I know you made comments earlier around the value proposition you offer around oncology. Maybe, Jeff, can you talk about any kind of earnings impact that you'll have for any headwinds on the oncology distributions side -- I'm sorry on the oncology reimbursement side, whether it's a shift from ASP plus 6, were other cuts due to sequestration?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, Lisa, clearly, the cuts for oncologists as part -- that happened as part of the sequestration, are a serious issue for our physician customers. When you step back, when you think about the overall scale of McKesson and the size or specialty business relative to the whole company and our role, I would say that it's not a material item for McKesson, even within the guidance range that we've given you. I think we'd also make -- I'd go back to some of the points John made in his comments, which is we also believe that the overall model we've developed in our specialty business is particularly attractive to physicians and practices at times when reimbursement is really putting a lot of pressure on the practices.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just so I understand, are you seeing a pickup in the number of physicians that are now coming under that model for U.S. oncology, because of the tough brand reimbursement environment?","John H. Hammergren","I think it's too early to suggest that the sequester, which only began to take effect April 1, had any impact on our quarter. I would say, Lisa, though, that if you think about what we've been doing over time, is evolving the strategy so that we can compete in a way that our customers look at us differently, perhaps, than others in the marketplace. And they come to us as a place that can help them improve their operating performance in ways that simple price discounts on distribution can't provide. And so the partnership we've created with U.S. oncology physicians is quite significant. And we have seen a nice increase in the number of physicians who have joined the U.S. oncology network during last fiscal year. So our comments are really pre-sequester comments related to physician adoption of our model. Clearly, we think the pressure is a 2-edged sword. It clearly is a negative impact as it relates to the current economics of physicians that are outside of the benefit that we can provide in a more holistic way and, to some extent, a drag on those inside of our network. But we work very well with our doctors to help offset those negatives to the extent that we can. And clearly, doctors that are not in the network are attracted to a place where they can find an expanded partnership that can help them deal with some of those challenges. So much like what we found with Health Mart and independent pharmacies, sometimes the pressure that's exerted causes people to open their minds to a different model that will expand their ability to operate more profitably.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you obviously have a lot to sort through here in a short amount of time. But I guess when we talk about these collective exit, realignment and restructuring charges in the fiscal fourth quarter of '13, is there any color just on how material the EPS savings are expected to be in the new fiscal '14 EPS guidance? So would that range of $7.90 to $8.20 have been completely different if you didn't take these actions, or it would have been around the same range? Just trying to get more color on the EPS.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","That's a fair question, Steven. The short answer is no, it wouldn't have materially changed. Our Nadro -- remember, Nadro is just an investment. So the equity earnings on that have been de minimis in recent years. And the combination of our International Technology business and our automation business was also de minimis when you look at FY '13. For FY '14, now it depends a little bit on how the transactional process goes here, but we'll report all that in the discontinued ops line. The bottom line is that this $7.90 to $8.20 EPS from continuing operations is not significantly impacted by any of those 3.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, not to make you put on your political prediction hat, but I know there is a bill in the House that calls for the removal of the oncology drug sequester cuts. I guess the way you see it now, do you think there is maybe a reasonable chance that these cuts could be reversed? Or is it more in the category of not holding your breath? Or do you just not want to comment on probabilities on that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, while the beginning of the political spectrum is difficult to comment on, and I certainly don't want to put myself in the shoes of the policymakers, I do think that oncologists have been perhaps more uniquely impacted in a negative way than the general health care industry through the sequester. And so we're very sympathetic and supportive of the moves to help our physicians get outside of this, what we think is an unfair and perhaps more heavily impacting their business model than others in the sector. Having said all of that, I think our financial forecasts for this year, going forward, are not going to be materially impacted one way or the other relative to the sequester. And so we feel comfortable that, as a corporation, we can work through these challenges. Clearly, at the physician level, depending on their mix of business, that's Medicare, Medicaid kind of oriented, the larger the impact. And we're working on those physician customers to try to find efficiencies to offset those hits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess sort of 2 housekeeping questions, if I could. First, fiscal '13 cash flow was very strong, as you mentioned, Jeff, down, I guess, a bit year-over-year based on your expectations for fiscal '14. Generic profitability is a difficult comp. Can you talk about any other key moving parts that we should be thinking about there on the cash side?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","No, the drop, Tom, in the guidance for '14 versus '13 is just the classic day of week that the relative years happen to end on. And given the magnitude of our revenues and receivables and payables, when you get a Monday or a Friday, is a huge difference. And that's really the main driver of the decline.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So '13 was maybe exaggerated a little bit up by timing and '14 exaggerated down, so the differential in reality isn't all that extreme.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","I think that's an excellent way to look at it.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you also mentioned in the text of the release on fiscal '14 outlook, you're expecting branded and generic price trends to sort of be similar in '14 as '13. Can you tell us what you saw in those 2 areas?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, yes, although I'll give you the caveat that every company and every consultant measures inflation differently. On the branded side for our internal purposes, we measure inflation looking at our particular product mix and doing a dollar-volume weighted calculation of the average price increase. And that is influenced not just by the average size of the price increase, but by how many you have, and some products take more than one in a year. When you do all that calculation, our index was in the 10% to 11% range last year, and we expect that same kind of range next year. The generics side is even trickier to talk about a number, because we model every new launch individually. For mature products, we calculate a dollar volume weighted average of how the overall price trends are going. As you know, if you go back 4 or 5 years, that indices used to often go down quite significantly, 10% or 15% a year. In recent years, it's been flat to up a little bit to down a little bit, and that's the same kind of trend we would anticipate for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, on the last call, you did reference $46 million in deferred Technology revenues. I assume nothing was recognized in the fourth quarter. And did the divestitures impact that number at all?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, to be clear, you're correct that, on the particular sales that we deferred in the December quarter, none of that was recognized in the March quarter. To be clear, we have lots of other ongoing business in that International Technology business, where the revenue continues to be recognized, and we have a great contract with the NHS, and we have lots of legacy clinical business, and all of that continues to just be recognized as is. But of the deferral piece, you are quite correct, that none of it was recognized in the March quarter. If look at FY '14, that entire business will now be reported down in discontinued operations, along with our Hospital Automation business and the revenues and profits of those business, as well as the costs and gains associated with their sales, will ultimately all flow through that line.","John H. Hammergren","Robert, we do not expect any of those revenues to be recognized in this quarter as well. So there was no change in our plan there.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And John, I heard a strong yes and a strong no on the international expansion. Can you -- kind of what's the disconnect? We're getting pitched these wonderful synergies of international collaboration. The rest of the industry seems to say wait and see, and you seem very much on the fence as well. Is there a stronger statement you could make one way or the other on that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's been our practice really not to talk about our strategy until it's ready to be revealed. I guess the point is that we think we have significant scale today. We don't think that our success is dependent on some type of a joint purchasing program or some type of an acquisition. Having said all of that, we also think that we can be successful on an ongoing basis by keeping our minds open and evolving our strategy and being aware of what our markets are doing. So at this point, I wouldn't count on us doing anything, and I wouldn't count us out on doing anything. I think the focus has to be on remaining agile in our approach. And I think you can -- if you look at our history as a company, we have -- we sometimes missed an opportunity and sometimes we missed a problem, and we'd like to keep that track record going. So we're going to continue to think about what we need to do, if anything, in addition to just outright execution everyday against a strategy we've had in place. We've been doing this private label generics thing for almost a decade now, from the beginning of the thought process to the execution we have today, and now we're bringing it to Canada. These are not easy things to do, and it takes a long time to do them right. And we're certainly not going to mess up our reputation or our customers' confidence in us by going halfhearted at something. And usually, like we did in that private label, we don't talk about it until it's successful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple on PSS. Jeff, I understand that you're saying that your operating performance expectations for PSS are unchanged. But if I go back, I think the original guidance, EPS guidance, that it's based off of a much higher interest rate than what you ended up securing. Would you mind sharing with us just what the actual new EPS contribution range is? Or is it as simple as just applying what the final rate was in order to get what you're thinking about EPS contribution from PSS in '14?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, the short answer is really what you just said at the end there. But just to level set for everyone, back in the original earnings call, we said, just to help people work through the math, that if you were to 100% debt-finance PSS at a 4% interest rate, we'd expect the resultant accretion to be $0.15 to $0.25. If you look at the last 6 months, we've done a couple of financing, raised about $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of about 2.1%, not 4%. So if you were to plug 2.1% into that calculation instead of 4%, it would add about another $0.05 to the accretion. It's always a little bit tricky to say, \"Well, does that debt all serve to finance PSS or did part of it fund the $800 million of share repurchase we did in the March quarter, cash funded [ph] ?\" But I'm just trying to help people understand, however you want to model the capital structure, our view of the earnings power of PSS remains unchanged.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess, just a broader question on the medical market share in ambulatory. We saw some significant growth from one of your U.S. competitors in the ambulatory space reported earlier today. I'm just wondering if you would comment on your positioning there, maybe how the transition has been going early days and specifically any comments around sales force engagement since the deal had been announced?","John H. Hammergren","Well, you can see in our prepared remarks, we had tremendous revenue growth, both pre-integration of the PSS number, and once you put it in, obviously, it grew even more nicely. But both PSS and McKesson, independently, grew very nice in the quarter. And you know that our footprint is quite significant in the physician or ambulatory space. That includes surgery centers. It includes independent physicians. It includes physicians that are owned by hospitals. It includes home health care. It includes long-term care. And so we do believe we have the strongest footprint in the industry in all of those settings of care. And we're really pleased that we've been able to evolve our product offering, our strategy, our technology in a way that enhances our go-to-market strategy. And so I think what you're at least seeing from us, and perhaps others are following, is a more holistic approach to the market and to the challenges our customers face. And as you also know, although we are quite significant now in the nonhospital or non-acute care settings, we have significant opportunity to grow because the market is highly fragmented. And our ability to attract new customers based on our value prop, we think will continue. As to the integration of the team at PSS, I think everybody remains engaged and enthusiastic. I mentioned Gary Corless on my phone call, and I also want to put a shout out to Stanton McComb. The 2 leaders of that business have come together with their teams and are doing a great job of putting the integration plans together. Our going-in assumption was that we would not lose a sales rep and, certainly, not eliminate one on purpose. And I can tell you that we've had almost 100% retention -- not quite, but almost 100% retention of our field selling forces. And we're working out the territory overlaps and the customers, and we feel quite confident we'll retain our people and we'll retain our customers. We're excited about that. Now clearly over time, there'll be some difficult decisions to make on synergies and taking cost out of our networks. But we have such a large opportunity here, we think that any employee negatively impacted should have an opportunity to explore other opportunities inside of McKesson. So we're off to a good early start. The businesses are performing well, and our customers are reacting very favorably.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My main questions are taken care of, so I'll just ask a quick one. I heard on the call several times about a fee pivot in revenue, a significant rebound, et cetera. The Street was modeling fiscal 2013 a little higher, so the growth rate is not exactly comparable, but the Street was looking for about 2.6% revenue growth in fiscal '14. My sense is that fee pivots and significant rebounds are more than 3% growth. So I'm hoping you can just give us a little more sense on what you are really signaling here.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, the short answer to your question, significant pivot, significant growth is well beyond 2.6%. We're always a little cautious, Eric, to give an overly precise number, because our revenue growth will be dominated by just pharmaceutical distribution. And it will be, in particular, dominated by the couple of large customers and exactly what their purchasing patterns are around brand. And of course, the impact on our bottom line of all that is far less than the impact on the revenue growth. All that said, our view probably of the markets' growth itself is probably a little more robust than I think some other pundits out there. Our view of our own customers growth, particularly a couple of large customers, is that when we look at their pipelines, we expect a few of our larger customers to grow above the market. And then you do have the added impact of just the math of adding in PSS. So in our Distribution Solutions segment, which drives the revenue growth for the whole company, we would expect to be much higher than the 2.6% you just cited.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fair. And if I could just one add-on, is the growth related to one of the better new drug approval years from the last 15 at the FDA, or is it that you're seeing market volumes and just customer mix, as you mentioned, being stronger?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, we're optimistic about new drug approvals, but I think that much of our view on revenue growth is being driven just by the growth our customers are going to receive this year and the lack of a dilutive effect of significant generic launches, which were pulling back our revenue in previous years. And clearly, just like Jeff said, there's a -- I think we have a more positive view on overall revenue growth for the industry than perhaps some others might have, because of this generic pullback.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Jeff, can you just comment on the sequential decline in direct and bulk revenue, please?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, let me take those backwards. If you look at bulk revenue, remember, that's less than a handful of our large customers, for whom we do a warehouse service as part of a much broader relationship. Some of the good news about the sequential decline is it's driven by some of those large customers putting more of their business through our direct model, which is actually much better for us. So that's really the story on warehouse. On direct, it's really just a function of the way the brand-to-generic conversions have rolled out through the year and, of course, it's the reversal of that trend, beginning next quarter and then really happening to a much greater extent as you get into the second, third and fourth quarters of FY '14, that causes such a pivot in the revenue growth rates.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just one more. You mentioned a potential, I think, LIFO charge for fiscal '14. That is included, I think, in your adjusted EPS. That's new from previous year's guidance. Any color around the size of that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's not in our guidance, but it would be included in our adjusted result. We won't adjust it out, if that's the question you're asking.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","It is so hard, David, to forecast this because it's a mathematical calculation we do once a year, which is driven by a methodology developed over 30 years ago, when the company first started doing LIFO accounting. And once you start it, you can never adjust it. And it is just very hard to predict. What we do know, however, is that the significant change in FY '14, in terms of the number of brand-to-generic conversions, will cause that calculation, potentially, to be significantly different than it has been. That's why we're calling it out, just so people understand that we have not included that in our guidance.","Operator","And our last question comes from George Hill with Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jeff, a little bit of an accounting question for you. Am I thinking about the IT segment right, where the Better Health 2020 investment spend, the bulk of that should be behind us as we go into fiscal 2014 and is that contributing to the margin improvements?","John H. Hammergren","Actually our investment -- if you listened to Jeff's comments, our R&D investment actually goes up in fiscal '14, so I think that we are -- versus '13, and I think you'll see that we are continuing to invest against that strategy. So we are not de-investing in the business yet, plus you know we have -- we'll have full year effect of some acquisitions we did in the prior year as well. So I think over time, we're hoping to get the return on investment from increased revenues and an improved mix in the business as opposed to reducing our investment in the business.","Well, I want to thank all of you and thank the operator for our help today and for paying attention to the call. We do have a solid plan for fiscal 2014, combining our expectations for expanded revenue growth in both of our segments and continued capital deployment. I'm proud of our track record of delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. And I want to acknowledge all of our employees here at McKesson for their passion and commitment to our goal of bringing better health to our customers and the patients they serve.","With that, I'll turn it over to Erin for a view of the upcoming events for the financial community.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 15 and The Goldman Sachs Health Care Conference in Ranchos Palos Verdes on June 11. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions.

And here's John Hammergren.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I begin my review of our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on a number of recent topics.","During January, we\u2019ve heard from the new administration of the prospect for planned changed to the U.S. Healthcare System as well as potential tax changes. We are all interested in these topics yet it is extremely difficult to provide any kind of assessment on the impact of reform as we don\u2019t have solid details on what those changes will be as we sit here today.","We look forward to engaging in the dialogue regarding these issues that may impact our industry, our business and the customers we serve as proposals evolve into real policy positions.","There are many moving pieces to reform and we will continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts of any proposals as we receive more information.","Moving now, we are pleased to have announced today that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds. CoverMyMeds mission is to help patients get access to the appropriate drugs for their care. Their service automates and accelerates the prescription approval process known as electronic prior authorisation, which is otherwise manual and time consuming.","CoverMyMeds takes administrative cost out of the system which supports patient help through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications.","CoverMyMeds products today streamlined a prior authorisation process for 47,000 pharmacies and 700,000 prescribers in the nation\u2019s largest health plans. The Company has partnered with McKesson\u2019s RelayHealth Pharmacy business since 2010 to expand its reach and offer its capabilities to a broad customer base.","As a reminder RelayHealth Pharmacy is a connectivity network providing real time claims, processing and other services to more than 50,000 retail pharmacy locations. Together, CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth Pharmacy can develop even more innovative tools for manufacturers, pharmacies, patients, payers and prescribers and continue to take administrative costs and inefficiency out of the healthcare system.","CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth Pharmacy and our other pharmacy technology businesses underpin our strategy to differentiate and add value to our distribution solutions business. As a reminder, RelayHealth Pharmacy will remain with McKesson following the close of the transaction to the Change Healthcare.","We are also making good progress on a couple of other important transactions. First on December 20, the Department of Justice closed its review and terminated the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act bringing us one step closer to the creation of the new change Healthcare.","Key leaders have been named and they are building up their teams as well as the support structure to allow the new business to meet the demands of its customers from day one. Management expects to raise the necessary financing and close the transaction later this quarter. We will provide additional updates after the transaction closes. Additionally, we are pleased to have closed the Rexall transaction and the integration work is underway. I look forward to working again with Domenic Pilla, who will assume overall leadership responsibility for McKesson\u2019s distribution and retail businesses in Canada, including Rexall Health.","Some of you may remember Domenic. He previously spend 10 years leading McKesson Canada from 2001 to 2011 and then built his retail expertise running Shoppers Drug Mart through its successful sale in 2014. I want to welcome the thousands of employees to joining McKesson on this new exciting opportunity.","Last we are very excited about the progress we\u2019ve made early on in launching [Claris 1] our sourcing activity with Wal-Mart. That organization is up in running and expanding our capabilities for suppliers. Our objective is to enhance our great partnerships with manufacturers and look for innovative ways to create value for all stakeholders.","Turning now to our recent financial performance. In our U.S. pharmaceutical business as a result of the generic pricing actions we began to implement late in our second quarter, we won back units and retained our independent stores. However, our prices were ultimately set at a lower level and our initial expectations that were included in our previous guidance.","As a result, we\u2019ve realized a lower contribution in the current quarter from this part of our business. And although branded pharmaceutical pricing trends were weak in the third quarter relative to our expectations, full year contribution from branded pharmaceutical compensation remains on track with our revised expectations that we shared with you last quarter.","Additionally, we incurred a few non-recurring charges in our distribution solutions segment that resulted in lower than expected operating profit contribution. James will go through those in a moment. As for our other North America Pharmaceutical businesses we continue to realize strong growth and we are making solid progress integrating Biologics, Vantage and Rexall.","Moving onto our international operations despite meaningful U.K. pharmacy reimbursement cuts that we previously discussed I am pleased with the constant currency revenue growth reported in the quarter. Our U.K. business continues to be impacted by reimbursement actions taken by the government. However, our teams are diligently working to offset and grow through these changes. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Mark Owen over his past 15 years with McKesson.","From leading our enterprise strategy to most recently heading up our operations in Europe. Mark will retire at the end of this fiscal year, so we are preparing for the transition of responsibilities to Brian Tyler a 20 year veteran who has served leadership positions across nearly all of our distribution solutions segment including most recently as President and Chief Operating Officer of Celesio working with Mark.","And last in our medical surgical business despite some revenue softness from the termination of a long term care customer and a weaker impact from the flu season, I am encouraged particularly by the progress we are making to expand our presence in the fast growing lab in Homecare businesses.","Now for technology solutions, we again posted strong performance relative to our expectations in prior year, even amidst all of the work underway to prepare for the changed Healthcare transaction. I commend the team for their focus throughout these events and I look forward to a strong finish to a very productive year.","Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017. Upside from our share repurchase activity in the quarter combined with a lower effective tax rate more than offset the lower than expected full year contribution from our distribution solutions segment. Based on these updates we now expect our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 to be in a range of $12.60 to $12.90 compared to our previous outlook of $12.35 to $12.85.","Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson is a company that has seen a significant change over its more than a 180 year history and we\u2019ve built a resilient company, a business that focuses everyday on the success of its customers and the efficiency of the Healthcare system it serves.","As we look to the future, we see significant growth prospects and it put in place the right assets in the right markets to take advantage of these opportunities. For example, McKesson now operates its scale and is highly efficient in every segment we serve. Our diverse set of global businesses are well positioned to take advantage of over arching demographic trends.","We believe that retaining control over our global procurement and sourcing capabilities is key and we have built comprehensive capabilities to capture growth in specialty. We have a large and growing footprint in retail. We have a strong value proposition to partner effectively with manufacturers and to service our customers including meaningful pharmaceutical technology solutions.","Across McKesson there is an experienced and long tenured management team and finally we continue to expect robust operating cash flow growth that is deployed in a disciplined approach and focused on long term shareholder value creation.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James Beer","Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our third quarter results and discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook. In addition, I will provide updates with respect to our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website.","This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our technology solutions segment during the second quarter, as well as prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses.","Now let\u2019s move to our results for the third quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.03 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was for $3.05 per diluted share as we recorded a $0.02 charge related to the cost alignment plan.","Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 6% in constant currency versus the prior period. Third quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from generic manufacturer inflation trends partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses.","Third quarter adjusted operating expenses excluding unusual items increased 2% in constant currency, driven by recent acquisitions, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts. Other income was $26 million for the quarter, an increase of 93% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [Indiscernible] a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands.","For fiscal 2017, we now expect other income to increase approximately 50% year-over-year. Interest expense of $74 million decreased 15% in constant currency for the quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be down by a mid teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016.","Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 14.3% for the quarter, driven by the beneficial impact of an inter company sale of software, a mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Expanding on this sale, in December McKesson sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our technology solutions segment to a U.S. based McKesson entity. This sale allows McKesson to claim tax deductions for the fair value of the assets and recognize the resulting tax benefit in our P&L over the estimated remaining lights of the assets.","As a result of this sale and excluding the EIS impairment charge taken in the second quarter, we now expect a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 2 4.5%. I want to caution you that fiscal 2017s expected adjusted tax rate is not an indicator of our future expected adjusted tax rate. Going forward, I would expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be closer to 30%.","Our income attributable to non controlling interest excluding unusual items was $14 million for the quarter. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interest to increase approximately 20% from fiscal 2016.","Our adjusted net income from continuing operations excluding unusual items totaled $677 million. Our third quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $3.05 decreased 4% versus the prior year.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the quarter we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $2 billion resulting in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreasing by 4% year-over-year to $222 million. As a result of the share repurchase activity in the third quarter we now expect our weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $223 million. And we now have $3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorisation.","Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.9 billion were up 6% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 10% driven by acquisitions and market growth.","Revenues were impacted by approximately $440 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were down 1% for the quarter, driven by the termination of a long term care contract and a weaker impact from the flu season. For Medical Surgical, we now expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2017.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 8% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from a generic manufacturer inflation trends, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses.","Third quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by our cost reduction actions.","Distribution Solutions third quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 23% in constant currency at $815 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 163 basis points, a decrease of 61 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed","As John mentioned, the segment adjusted operating profit results include two non-recurring charges. Together, these total approximately $68 million. We expect our Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points.","Now moving to Technology Solutions. Revenues were flat for the quarter at $694 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","Third quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was up 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 4% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our ongoing cost management efforts.","Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 25% in constant currency, resulting in a corresponding adjusted operating margin of 23.92%, up 476 basis points versus the prior year. The increase was driven by growth outside of our hospital software business, and lower operating expenses.","We continue to be pleased by the ongoing execution of our technology solution segment as we work to close the change healthcare transaction. I\u2019ll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you\u2019ve heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days\u2019 sales outstanding were little changed at 26 days.","Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased five days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in payables days sales relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with approximately $1.8 billion held offshore. For the first nine months of the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2 billion in common stock, repaid approximately $390 million in long term debt and spent $369 million on internal capital investments.","We now expect property and acquisitions and capitalized software expenses to be between $550 million and $650 million in fiscal 2017. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.","The cash been generated $3.3 billion in cash flow from operations during the first nine months of our fiscal year. In this quarter alone we deployed more than $4 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases. For the full-year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments released to the cost alignment plans and the recent settlement with the DEA and DOJ.","Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, our third quarter earnings were favorably impacted by the lower-than-expected tax rates. We now expect a full-year adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS, goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of a 24.5%, a decrease of 3% points from our prior expectation. In addition, we now expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be $223 million following share repurchase activity in the third quarter compared to our previous expectation of $226 million. ","These tax and share cap items will drive upside of approximately $0.65 of earnings per diluted share for the full-year. As a reminder, during the third quarter we recorded non-recurring charges that are approximated $60 million which will impact our full-year. And as John discussed, while our pricing of generic pharmaceutical in our independent pharmacy channel has helped us retain share, our pricing is now set at a level lower than our previous expectations. As a result, we expect the profit contribution from these customers will be reduced versus our previous guidance.","Regarding the brand manufacturer pricing environment, pricing remained weak in the third quarter as discussed at a recent investor conference. However, we have seen activity in January that is in-line with our previous full-year expectation of mid to high single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. And lastly, we expect our distribution solutions adjusted operating margin excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points.","As a result of these updates, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $12.35 to $12.85 to a new range of $12.60 to $12.90. This range excludes approximately between $1.28 and $1.30 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in our second quarter and the anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. A list of the key assumptions underpinning our updated fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slide 17 and 18.","Before I wrap up my comments on our fiscal 2017 outlook, I also wanted to mention the while not yet a material contributor to our current earnings, we are pleased by the progress we are making in establishing Carrollton our sourcing initiative with Walmart. Now, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. First, we closed the Rexall transaction in late December. As a reminder, for fiscal 2017 we expect the earnings attributable to Rexall Health will be offset by an anticipated charge related to a fair value adjustment of acquired inventory.","Now, moving to our announced acquisition of CoverMyMeds. McKesson has ended into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion or approximately $900 million net of incremental cash tax benefits. An additional $270 million will be paid if CoverMyMeds reaches certain performance matrix through fiscal 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including end trust approval and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2018. We expect the transaction will be funded by a mix of cash and debt.","By the third year, following the close of the transaction, we cast an expect attrition of $0.30 to $0.40 to adjusted earnings per diluted share. This transaction will complement our other distribution solutions technology businesses such as a Relay pharmacy and our McKesson pharmacy technology and services business which are both core to executing on our strategy. Given the double digit growth opportunities we see for these businesses, I believe they can drive combined revenues of approximate $1 billion and become a material contributor to McKesson's operation profit growth within three years.","Moving now to the pending change healthcare transaction. We expect the transaction will close this quarter and at that time we expect to record a significant one time gain on the contribution of our net assets to change healthcare. This gain will be excluded from our adjusted earnings. In addition, McKesson will receive $1.25 billion of cash at closing. Due to the numerous moving pieces that are involved in the transaction of this kind, we will provide more detailed information following its close.","To be clear, McKesson's current fiscal 2017 guidance range of $12.60 to $12.90 assumes a full quarter of MTS earnings. In closing, we are actively engaged in planning for the next fiscal year and we'll provide our fiscal 2018 outlook and underlying assumptions when we announce our fourth quarter earnings in May. Thank you and with that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others opportunity to participate. Noah?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the question. I guess John I am still struggling on to understand a little bit the magnitude over the last two quarters from the negative impact from branded pricing specifically. If we think about some of the comments previously about 10% to 20% of branded contract being linked to non-fee per service just having trouble bridging the reduction given from the last few quarters. So, I was hoping maybe you could just walk us through a little bit of how we bridge that gap around the EBIT within pharma distribution and the reductions from last quarter and now, this quarters?","John Hammergren","Well, I will turn it over to James to start out though, I think we have done some really good work over the last several years to make sure we have the right balance of fixed compensation and variable compensation for the branded manufacturers and that work continues and I believe now the split of our profit from the branded partners is roughly in that 90:10 kind of a range. So we have reduced the exposure to both the risk and the opportunity here. And but having said that it still remains a material amount of our profitability to your point and we knew that there was going to be some risk in this quarter related to our back-half guidance but we hope that the fourth quarter was going to be stronger than certainly the third quarter in line with the guidance we provided you on the last call.","And that's really I think what we are seeing today is that our from full-year perspective based on January we believe we are going to have the back half performance that we had anticipated. James?","James Beer","Yes. I just had that in Q3 the profit contribution from branded manufacturer price inflation was really quite weak. That was real holding back in terms of manufacturers taking price increases and that certainly held was a material driver in our Q3 EPS result. As John saying, we are seeing a different situation playing out in Q4 thus far so our expectation is when you look at the back-half and then the full-year, we are able to continue to forecast what we had said previously about branded inflation being in that mid to high single-digit range. So, certainly a soft Q3 but it appears to be stronger in Q4.","Robert Jones","Great. And I guess just the follow-up related to the reduction in the quarter or the short form a quarter related to pharmaceutical distribution. It sounds like John if I heard you correctly the pricing on independent ended up ultimately being a little bit lower than what you guys has assumed last quarter? I guess what drove this and is there still what you would describe as maybe outside pricing pressure in the marketplace around that customer segment?","John Hammergren","Well, I think you have the first half of that assumption correct. It ended up being a little lower than what we had built into our previous guidance and when the price for our customers was set at the end of the quarter we ended up producing less profitability than we had anticipated but clearly the units we covered and our relationship with our customers improved as we went throughout the quarter.","So, I think we have got that issue behind at this point at least today and I think it's just a question of making an estimate early in the quarter when we are still in the process of implementing our reaction to those pockets of increased competition.","James Beer","And then the other day I were just -- reinforced the third quarter that impacted the results were these two non-recurring items that I referred to in my text, the total $60 million in profit contribution. So, that was certainly an important drive as well.","Robert Jones","Got it, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Velazquez with Bank of America.","Steven Velazquez","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just for us, you guys absolutely don't normally break out any sort of operating profit by geography but just thinking about the side the distribution solutions was down by 24% year-over-year in the quarter. Share me the comment at sort of high level from when thinking about US versus Europe. Was the decline in the US more or less than that 24% average and then also just thinking about some of the moving parts in a year or two? I guess we're all just curious how geographically things shook out just between those two when thinking about the average. Thanks.","James Beer","Well, as you mentioned we don't break out the profit by geography. I think the way to think about it is that we had gone into this fiscal year with a view of what might happen from a reimbursement perspective in the UK and then we very quickly realized that UK reimbursement environment was going to be more difficult. And I think ourselves and others talked about the challenge that put in front of us and I think we have done a really good job of now understanding what that effect is on that business and working hard to offset it to grow and to grow through it. I think the thing that became surprise obviously at the end of the year here for us in the back-half was both these onetime items as well as the view that independent generic pricing environment was going to be a bit difficult for us.","I don't, I think other than that it's probably difficult for us to provide you more nuance guidance other than cleanly having two markets that are significant to us being negatively impacted simultaneously and then in addition having the inflation environment and brand being below what we had expected at the beginning of the year both played into it weaker than we had expected certainly quarter end and obviously the year as well.","John Hammergren","And I would just add that while obviously we have seen those challenges in the UK market around reimbursement, we haven't seen similar things playing out in other European countries for Celesio, those have been tracking very much along the lines of our expectation during the year.","James Beer","Yes. We are happy with the growth in those markets. I think the team is beginning to expand beyond just sort of the retail pharmacy business into other areas of opportunities or encouraged by that and the acquisitions we have made have been well executed and are delivering that real value. So, we talked about the revenue growth on the call but you look under the covers if you take out the UK reimbursement challenge, the business is performing well.","Steven Velazquez","Okay. I appreciate, just a color, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Good afternoon. So, just turn to a waterfall app on the prepared comments, you talked about the weaker trends on generic inflation but when we think about these trends, where they environment with what you expected when you provided the guidance at the end of the second quarter or in generic deflation environment deteriorated throughout the quarter as well?","James Beer","Well, I'd say couple of things. The way that we have been seeing generic inflation playing out obviously that's on a very small subset of the overall molecule base that has continued to be in line with our expectations very similar, so the story of the last couple of conference calls.","John Hammergren","In terms of the generic deflation environment which is obviously the norm in this part of the marketplace across the across the complete sways of molecules. We continue to gain see nothing as normal here that's having material impact on the business model, so very much adequate system with what we have been saying overall this year.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then with all the uncertainties around manufacturer's ability to raise brand prices and questions on whether 2nd July price increase can ultimately happen. Since it's shifting all the revenues, see for service and removing this contingency on price is increasingly more relevant. So, one can you talk about where you are in this process. I know John that you have talked about it in your prepared remarks but if you can give some more details.","And second of all, if hypothetic be branded manufacturers are after only one price increase in the calendar year, how should we think about this when we model? Should we then model and I know that I'm stealing into 2018 question but should we hypothetically then think about a September core is where good profits would be down 10% year-over-year if no price increases happen this quarter? Just conceptually how should we be thinking about that and how we can assess that kind of like embedded risk or that bare case scenario?","James Beer","Well, I think to your first part of your question, we are working actively with the manufacturers to make sure that we have our line of sight to the economics that are appropriate for the service that we provide. I think the manufacturers very much appreciate the work that we do and certainly have a willingness to fund our business model and to help us manage their business in a way that's more efficient frankly for them. And so, we are excited to continue to play that role.","And with many of our manufacturer relationships, our economics have been properly set for a long time in the vehicle that we have been using to be paid. And that is risky as a price increase vehicle might be as the method by which we would be paid the piece that we deserve. And so, to your point, to the extent that we have been dependent on price increases as a funding mechanism with a manufacturer who is no longer on their own taking those price increases will certainly go back to them and because of that behavior change, worked and negotiated a relationship that gives us as I said our compensation.","On the second front, it was difficult for us to predict when manufacturers are going to have price increases. Whether they are going to have one or two or more, what the rate of increase will be, are they say going to, if they say they're going to have one and they are going to have all the ones at the same time or are they going to have multiple on these products at different times of year or different products at different times during the year. So, I think it is a little bit of black box to your point.","From a modeling perspective, it's probably a little premature for us to give you a view as to how we are going to think about the quarterly progression of our profitability and clearly when we are on our conference call in May to the extend we have better visibility we will try to help you not only understand that the risk we still have in our model which we try to outline at the beginning of every fiscal year with our assumptions but we'll try to also try to help you understand how price increase behavior quarter-to-quarter may create variability or risk.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay, thank you.","James Beer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian","Good afternoon John, James. Following-up on a prior question regarding independent pharmacy price and to further clarify, could you discuss the current market alignment that you are seeing. So, has pricing stabilized, was any of the downside related to additional actions by either the competitors or which was just your only in the midst of the process we made an estimate or any other factor that you could elaborate on, would be appreciated.","John Hammergren","Clearly we have great visibility to our customers demand from us and we have a great visibility to the mix of products that they order and just the relationship overall. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, with our customer base, we saw our recovery in both units and frankly added to it related to their long-term partnership with us and we've retained our relationship and our business for those stores. That's an indication that the pricing decision that we made in the quarter and talked about in the previous call was appropriate and then the price that we set at the end of the process in the quarter was the appropriate price otherwise we would have not seen that customer retention or that unit recovery.","So, I hesitate to say that pricing isn't a fluid environment but we typically don't see these large pockets of price competition in our basic customers and we seemed to have resolved that with the actions we took earlier in the quarter. And I think lastly what I would say is that I think the estimate we made early was more informed as we got through the process and it was more of an estimate as we started the process and so to answer your question about continued heightened or unusual competition in our independent customer base we believe has largely subsided because of the actions we take.","Garen Sarafian","That's useful. And then a follow-up on the branded drug that you mentioned that you are now at 90 ton breakout. So, within that 90% that fee for service, do you typically build in any flexibility into those types of contracts where you be relatively not that to either net or gross pricing or any cause to revisit the contracts, certain situations occur?","John Hammergren","First of all, I'd like to maybe clarify a point about the contracts being 90:10 as opposed to the income being 90:10. So, when James and I talk about 90:10 ratio on profit from branded manufacturer, that's really how the dollars result out of those relationships. We shouldn't take it to mean that 90% of our contracts are fixed and 10% of our contracts aren't.","Garen Sarafian","Absolutely, I misspoke. Correct.","John Hammergren","And secondly, we have an ongoing discussion with our partners as you might imagine. And it is a good relationship and I believe that the dollar value of the service we provide is where our conversations typically are focused. Now it's obviously drive by a multiple of revenue or throughput through our business but the dollars are what fund are activity.","And so, if there were to be a dramatic change in the way our partners price their products and your description is going from the gross price to a net of rebates price, we clearly would only be happy if we could cover the same dollar result out of that new matrix as opposed to a different kind of relationship. So, I think that the likelihood of that happening number one is slim and second if it were to happen we currently would actively renegotiate our contracts to create a mirror image result that we have today with the different set of multipliers or factories involved. At least that\u2019s where I would attempt to reconcile.","Garen Sarafian","That's very useful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. Good afternoon, John and James. James let me just start with the first question around the non-recurring items that you called out for $60 million. 1) Did I just miss all the commentary what they are for 2) and if they were included in this quarter does that help to explain the progression as we get into your guidance for or the implied guidance for drug distribution in the fourth quarter?","James Beer","So, the $60 million with the two items recorded in Q3, so yes that's the an important element in bridging through to the full-year guide. So, that is something I particularly do want to emphasize. That's correct.","Lisa Gill","Can you tell us or give us little more color what they were for?","James Beer","One was a resolution of a customer contract that had related to a variety of years going back in time so certainly something that I think of as a onetime type item. And the other was an accounting reserve that we believe was appropriate to take again around receivables in the certain segment of the business within distribution solutions. So we feel as though we are being appropriately conservative around those reserves.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. And then just to think about a topic as we think about going into the fourth quarter John, you discussed a ton around this in your dynamic, in the independent market but I just want to make sure that I understand in the third quarter we saw all the pricing impact so when we think about this progression from the third quarter to the fourth quarter independent stays the same the pricing on branded looks a little bit better because it's coming in within your expectations versus the third quarter was below we don't have these onetime items as we go into the fourth quarter and I think that you commented also again correct me if I am wrong that generic price deflation is also roughly within your expectations, but we also see [Claris 1] start to impact the numbers in that fourth quarter?","John Hammergren","Pretty a good bunch of questions Lisa, but let me start, I will have James jump in if I miss something. Clearly there might be a little bit of a tail of continued lap negative on the independent pricing just because as I mentioned our estimate on the last call was slightly higher than where it actually netted when we set the price and that netting process probably left us a month or weeks off in the full quarter effects in Q3 if that makes sense to you. As you go into Q4 there is a little missing hole there on that net price affect on the independent business.","The branded price inflation I think that is, what\u2019s early in this quarter to call it but I would say that we believe that on the back half guide for branded price inflation we are going to be in pretty good shape. We didn't have much in our expectations around generic price increases and then we had these onetime items that James referred to a few moments ago. James.","James Beer","And in Claris 1, I wouldn't expect that to be material contributor in Q4. I think that will help us in FY 18. ","Lisa Gill","Okay great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know this hasn't come up yet, well it has come up, but James can you quantify or I guess provide any kind of sense of severity around what was the step down in the [selfie] pricing versus what you thought was at the end of fiscal 2Q versus where it came in the end of fiscal Q3?","James Beer","I am not again to sort of offer a specific guide around that as John was alluding to the expect, it's going to be at the sort of the full run rate in Q4 and we saw significant majority of that same effect in Q3, but there was a certain movement downward during the quarter after we had last spoken to you on this call.","George Hill","Okay. And then maybe just kind of a quick follow-up on just kind of one more on this topic is that if most of the impact was observed in fiscal Q3, I guess fiscal Q2, Q3 and Q4 then there is - there is a little bit of lapping impact that takes place early in fiscal \u201918 and then it's kind of fully behind us from a comp perspective. I want to make sure that I am not missing something either in the contracting methodology or in the pricing methodology or the pricing impact of this is able to be contained and then margins expand again it's kind of the pricing that\u2019s, the pricing is occurred with the segment of the market that those profits have kind of been extracted here and have been passed through the customer. That's not something that returns to us?","John Hammergren","So, I would expect the lapping effect that you are referring to in the first half of the year just a little bit into A Q3 as well because system was what I was saying just a moment ago.","James Beer","And George, I think some people probably don't fully understand that we priced the generics, every day we are pricing generics. So to forecast where the generic profitability will for our customer base next year is probably difficult. Obviously, Clais 1 will have an effect on us from a buying perspective and we set our sell prices on the generic space so that our customer get a competitive price and a fair price but that is a bit of a moving target I don't want you to think that our pricing has been \u201clocked in\u201d and sometime form us a lake way, it really is responsive to market conditions.","George Hill","Okay that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Hi, good afternoon. So I realize you are not going to give us details on 2018 in terms of guidance in general. But, from a methodology standpoint given the volatility we\u2019ve had in results this year and given some of the challenges in forecasting some of the specific factors, is there any thoughts just sort of whether it\u2019s from a transparency or in terms of other things you all give us sort of help understand the trajectory. Any thoughts on sort of the methodology of whether or not you intend to sort of guide as you typically do and provide many of the same metrics or do you think now that with some high data is there other things we should be looking at to get a better sense. Because it does feel like there is a lot going on in the business right now. It's kind of hard to ascertain Q to Q kind of the flow of where profits are going?","John Hammergren","I am certainly sympathetic to the difficultly in terms of understanding the dynamics of our business. I think that I will let James jump in here little bit on the whole forecasting and what we might provide you in terms of view as we get into next fiscal year. I will say however that the business is always complex and they are lots of moving parts to it and they always have the lots and moving parts. The challenge that we have this fiscal year in particular is it that the moving parts are moving negative on us simultaneously and usually you have things that are offsetting in the business so we don't end up with as you said the challenge and forecasting because we have generally offset some of the negative things with more positive things and unfortunately this year we haven't had that type of dynamic.","James Beer","Yes, I would just add that obviously was still going through however FY 18 planning process. As I think about the discussions we have had on these three conference calls of this fiscal year obviously we\u2019ve ended up having to talk about different things in a more detailed manner to be able lay out the underlying drivers of the results and we will take that perspective into how we think about discussing our guide as well. So I think that does logically expand the variables that we have traditionally talked about when we have done the May earnings calls just because we have been expanding all the discussions during the last three conference calls with you.","Ross Muken","And that\u2019s helpful perspective and I guess obviously executing quite a bit share repurchase in the quarter you saw quite a bit outstanding but you also have a lot of cash cutting in and you have the proceeds from change I mean obviously you guys have always done a portfolio approach. Is there any bias to share repurchase medium term still just given where the stock is and how you compare that to kind of the external opportunities or you still see a ton in the pipeline that you feel like it can give you more superior returns than buying your own stock today?","James Beer","Well, we certainly continue to light the portfolio approach to capital allocation that we have deployed for a number of years. Obviously in the last quarter, we did a goodly amount of both M&A as represented by the rightful transaction as well as share buyback. Today we have announced the acquisition of Cover my meds.","So, I think that's an illustrative we continue to see opportunities to deploy capital to M&A that we believe can generate long term cash flow profit growth and build the strategic capability of the company. That said, we aptly through the cash flow generation and that's of course giving us more flexibility to take advantage as I think we have in this last quarter with a quite large share buyback action. At a time we are not stocks trading at a relatively low multiple.","Ross Muken","Great, thanks James.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny","Good afternoon guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I think there was a question while back around your conversations with manufacturers and how that's changing the [indiscernible] changing pricing dynamics. I guess John, overtime you mentioned the relationship you guys have, is a value for value rationale, you guys are true partners. As you think going forward, as you go back to have these conversations, what are the key selling points that you are focused on offering them particularly environment where these manufacturers continue to get questions about their pricing environment and how do you think about the incremental value proposition above and beyond what you guys have done for the last 10-20-30 or 100-80 years with these various different companies?","John Hammergren","Well clearly, we are trying to build our capabilities so to your point the value proposition we delivered to them hopefully year in and year out is increasing in value. And frankly the Cover my meds discussion we had in the beginning of this call is a very positive example of where we are deploying capital to help our manufacturers particularly the branded manufacturers the revenue side of their P&L which frankly is probably a lot more important to them then the basis point side of their P&L where they pay us and I think that - the ability for us to get people on their meds to reduce the friction associated with getting prescription filled and to keep people on their meds after they have been prescribed and to reduce the administrative cost associated with payers and pharmacies dealing with patients and physicians who are trying to get prescriptions filled will be very helpful and has proven to be very helpful.","And clearly, we have done the same thing on our U.S. oncology business where we are no longer just necessarily a commodity wholesaler trying to sell oncology products, but we are a company that can truly partner with the physician to change the character of their practice and the profitability of their practice. So, you will see us continue to do that and on the specific issue of the fee structure with manufacturers, clearly if we have been working alongside them for years and developed a relationship around being paid through price inflation, I think it's fair for us to go back and ask them when they have changed their behavior not related to us to go back to them and ask them to pay us a different way if they are no longer going to use our price increases as the funding mechanism for their wholesale relationship. So, we are going to be successful as rapidly as we want and we are going to be 100% successful not yet to be seen but that clearly is our objective adding more value and making sure that we strike a bargain where they can feel fair the composition we have asked for is fair.","Michael Cherny","Thanks John. I know, it\u2019s odd time, so I appreciate the color.","John Hammergren","You are welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby","Just a quick one for James, you mentioned that you would comment on the changed healthcare transaction upon closing. Is that sometime inter-quarter as you mentioned or will the comments really on the guidance and the contribution come with the May conference call?","James Beer","No, I would expect that we will be closing the transaction during this quarter and it will be appropriate to update you at that time.","Robert Willoughby","Okay, press release then and call or just press release?","James Beer","Well, I am not sort of those details, so it maybe a press release. We will see how things play out in the next three or four weeks.","John Hammergren","And certainly, we don't have a public call. Obviously, the IR team is available to help address questions if it's not clear from the press release.","Robert Willoughby","Perfect. Thank you.","John Hammergren","I want to thank you, I know, for your help today and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. We continue to focus on the success of our customers and the value we deliver everyday and we look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2018 outlook when we provide you our fourth quarter earnings results in May.

Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2016. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $47.5 billion, up 13%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 30%, both on a constant currency basis over the prior year.","During the first quarter we completed the sale of our Nurse Triage business, a small business within the Technology Solutions segment, and we recorded a gain of $0.16 per diluted share in the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86 for fiscal 2016.","Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $46.8 billion, up 13% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 17% on a constant currency basis. Our North American Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, and McKesson Canada, continued to lead the way, with revenue growth in the first quarter up 16% on a constant currency basis.","Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from a few of our largest customers and brand pricing trends ahead of our expectations. However, generic pricing trends were well below the level of the prior year and below our expectations for the first quarter. We will continue to monitor pricing trends in the market and will provide updates as we communicate our quarterly results going forward.","We continue to grow our business with our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers across the retail, institutional, and independent channels. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our vibrant community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country, including our growing base of Health Mart pharmacy customers, now representing more than 4,000 stores across the U.S.","Record attendance at this year's conference reinforced the growing need for independent pharmacists to understand the dynamics shaping their industry and to evolve their business to meet these new demands. This year's conference centered on our strategy to help customers attract more patients through greater access to preferred networks and highlighted McKesson's suite of services, which enable pharmacies to operate more efficiently and capture new sources of revenue. We've hosted this conference now for almost 40 years, and it continues to provide an exceptional platform for peer networking and continuing education while celebrating innovation, patient commitment, and business growth of our exceptional independent pharmacist partners.","In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver for our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart. As some of you may have heard me say on occasion, it is our standard of operational excellence that earns us the privilege to serve our customers every day. And it's our team's focus on our customers' success that allows us to grow our relationships and create value far beyond the core of Distribution Solutions.","Turning now to our McKesson Specialty Health, I'm extremely pleased with the results for the first quarter, which represent a strong start to the fiscal year. Once again, we delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in the U.S. oncology network and our broader oncology offerings and continued excellent growth in other multi-specialty categories. I believe we are very well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market.","And our Canadian business had nice growth in the quarter, with results that were in line with our expectations. At our Investor Day last month, we highlighted the great achievements of our Canadian business. I'm now pleased to tell you that our team continues to grow, not only our core distribution business, but also expanding into our specialty and retail banner presence in the market. The recent addition of the Remedy'sRx banner in Canada adds to the scale we have built to support independent pharmacy. I'm proud to say that roughly 40% of all independent pharmacies in Canada operate under one of our banners, and we leverage our innovative services, products and technology to drive better results for our business and our customers.","Turning now to our results for international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, revenues for the first quarter were $5.8 billion, roughly flat year over year on a constant currency basis. And operating performance from Celesio was ahead of our expectations in the quarter.","Earlier today, Celesio announced the acquisition of the pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's, a leading chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement, Celesio will acquire 277 in-store pharmacies and four hospital-based pharmacies, which will now be operated and branded as LloydsPharmacy. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 and will broaden the already strong footprint of LloydsPharmacy in the United Kingdom and add scale to the more than 12,000 owned or banner pharmacies across McKesson. In summary, we're off to a positive start to the year and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business.","And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter, with revenues of $1.4 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, including strong growth in our physician office business. Our McKesson surgical team continues to do an excellent job as we enter the home stretch of the integration activities driven by the PSS World Medical acquisition. We expect to complete our planned integration efforts by the end of fiscal 2016, on schedule and ahead of our original business case. And while our Medical-Surgical team is still in the midst of a tremendous amount of work, I'd like to recognize the outstanding progress they've made to-date and their success in driving better value for our customers.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of Distribution Solutions in the first quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high-single digits compared to the prior year. And we now expect that full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 4% for the first quarter to $736 million, driven primarily by anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the sale of our nurse triage business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 22.7%, which includes a $51 million pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the nurse triage business. Excluding this gain, adjusted operating margin would have been 15.8%. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our Financial and Clinical Data and Services businesses, which include RelayHealth and our physician revenue cycle business, along with positive results in our payer solutions business. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions, and I remain confident in our outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the high teens from the segment.","Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year outlook for fiscal 2016 to a range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our nurse triage business. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $454 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.","Earlier today the Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28 per share. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86. This revised outlook is a result of the pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share from the sale of our nurse triage business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the quarter. We do not expect that the elimination of the nurse triage business' operating results will have a material impact on our expectations for fiscal 2016 adjusted operating profit.","Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.14, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3, consolidated revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $47.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 13%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 9%, driven by the performance in both segments.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for a quarter on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, operating expenses are presented net of the $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. Excluding this gain, total adjusted operating expenses were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $15 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $89 million decreased 7% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis.","Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter to quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 31.5%.","Adjusted income for the quarter was $737 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 27% on a reported basis and up 30% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.06 per share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our diluted weighted average shares were flat year over year at 235 million.","While we continue to plan for upcoming significant debt maturities, today's announced acquisition and dividend increase are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which for some years now has focused on a blend of internal investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.","Let's now review the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $46.8 billion were up 10% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency during the quarter. North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues of $39.5 billion increased 16% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Our largest customers drove strong growth, with a corresponding impact on our mix business and margin profile.","In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we now expect North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year.","International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat relative to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Overall revenue growth, driven by our businesses in the United Kingdom, was mainly offset by an anticipated revenue decline from last year's loss of a Norwegian hospital contract.","As a reminder, the results from Celesio's operations in Brazil are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth.","Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. The increase in Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was driven by the strong revenue growth in our North American Distribution business, the timing of certain brand drug price increases that occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we expected, a benefit from antitrust settlement proceeds that was contemplated in our guidance, and a better than expected performance from Celesio. Offsetting this growth were weaker than expected generic drug pricing trends in the quarter. The level, nature, and timing of generic pricing trends remain difficult to predict. We will continue to monitor market activity and will provide updates to you as we communicate our results each quarter.","Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 3% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense increased 4% year over year.","Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, an improvement of eight basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year, driven by solid growth across the segment, including continued expansion of our generics business, favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases, the anticipated antitrust settlements, and better than expected results from Celesio. This year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin expansion was partially offset by weaker generic pricing trends and our business mix.","As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full-year revenue growth from our North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year, driven in part by higher than expected demand from our largest customers. Based on this growth and the resulting mix of revenue in our North American Distribution business, we now expect segment adjusted operating margin to increase by mid-single-digit basis points year over year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 4% for the quarter to $736 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform and the sale of our Nurse Triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","As I discussed earlier, our consolidated first quarter gap in adjusted results reflect a pre-tax gain of $51 million from the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This gain was recorded as a reduction to Technology Solutions operating expenses for the first quarter.","Adjusted operating expense in the segment decreased 27% and segment adjusted operating profit increased 109%, primarily as a result of this gain. Excluding this gain, segment adjusted margin increased 534 basis points year over year. For the full year, excluding the gain recorded on the sale of our Nurse Triage business, we continue to expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics, as you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased by one day to 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by three days to 53 days. We generated $454 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion, with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $120 million for the quarter.","Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our original range of $12.20 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.24 per share in amortization of acquisition-related tangible assets and $0.30 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.86 and $0.96 per share in LIFO-related adjustments, short of our adjusted earnings.","While we cannot predict the timing of pharmaceutical pricing activity, our current expectation is that the split of earnings between the first and second half of fiscal 2016 will be in line with our experience in fiscal 2015.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Solari?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions here. First of all, obviously, generic inflation is a big focus area for investors, so thank you for your comments on that. But can you just help us understand, how should we think about generic inflation trending within the context of your guidance range?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly, as we've mentioned, we did see generic price increase activity below the levels of the last fiscal year and below our original expectations. Now, that said, obviously our guide that we issued a few months back has a variety of variables that are key to it, and we list those out for you. So the width of the range allows us some flexibility to take into account variables of one driver that's up versus another driver down. So we're comfortable with the range that we've articulated this afternoon. That reflects the addition of the care management nurse triage gain. And of course we'll keep everyone updated as we proceed through the fiscal year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow up, very strong top-line growth for distribution solutions, up 15% despite some impressive year-over-year comps you're anniversarying. So when you think about the environment and branded inflation that you've seen in the quarter, do you expect similar trends for the remainder of the year? It seems just the growth is stronger than what you guys implied in the Analysts Day.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've had good success in growing our business across the board. And I think the interesting part of the base of business that we have in our mix is that we have some customers that are growing we think more rapidly than the market. And that growth is clearly seen in our business. That comes with it better revenue growth, but it does put a little pressure on our mix as a result of the scale of those customers. We're certainly pleased with the performance in the quarter and we expect that revenue momentum to continue throughout the fiscal year.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And one of the other drivers of the revenue strength in Q1 was the acceleration of some of the branded price increases that occurred in the first quarter that we were originally expecting to occur later in the year.","Next question?","Operator","We'll move next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I think we all understand the comments about generic inflation being difficult to predict. There's definitely no question about that. But I guess I'm just curious, with your privilege of daily conversations with generic suppliers, with some 20\/20 hindsight now, do you have any thoughts or any opinions on what you think may have just led to that temporary slowdown of generic inflation in the June quarter? Or do you just attribute that to randomness and obviously some tough comps year over year that we saw for the June quarter in particular? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Steve. I think the comps are clearly one of the challenges when we think about the strength of the price increases in the prior year. I think that although we have close working relationships with the generic manufacturers, they don't always share with us their plans related to price increases. Clearly their view of product launches, their merger and acquisition activity, there are lots of things moving around in the market that may also be distracting them from some the things that they may be doing on a short-term basis or could have done on a short-term basis. I think our view is that we believe that generic pricing power will remain a part of the strategy generic companies will employ. And that balanced with the scheduled generic launches, et cetera, are part of the things that drive their P&Ls.","I would say following on to what James said earlier, there are lots of variables in the way our quarters flow. And one of the positive things in the quarter was the fact that our brand price inflation work was a little stronger than we'd seen on a compare basis. So there are always puts and takes as you move along. And I think the most important thing is that we continue to find ways to move the business. And we're obviously also very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business and Celesio had a very good quarter. So both Specialty and Celesio performed above what we would have expected, even though our generic price part of our business may have been a little bit behind.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take next Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So on the topic of growth at large customers, do you think that growth is coming at the expense of smaller customers? Or is it that the larger customers are getting a greater share of where we do see outsized market growth?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Clearly I think the Specialty business is more inclined to go through the larger customer, particularly in the PBM channel. We obviously have seen some market shifts in PBMs as well. And I would imagine on the edge, our larger customers are taking some incremental share in the market. But I would say that at least the base of independents that McKesson is involved and closely working with, we've seen good strength in that business, both in the growth of Health Mart stores but also in terms of their revenue growth.","So I think the most important thing for us to do is to continue to focus on bringing our scale and our capabilities to the smaller customers to help them continue to level the playing field relative to the larger customers. And on the larger customer side, we have to find ways to add more value so that our margin impact isn't as negative as it can be when the mix changes.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Even absent the growth at the top line, operating expense seemed to come in quite a bit below where we expected on the Distribution side where you didn't have the impact. Could you speak to some of the activity and how it felt relative to your own expectation?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We are very focused on, as you know, Eric, in being efficient and productive in our operations. I think we have over 3,000 \u2013 closer to 6,000 black belts if you include Celesio around the world. And those folks are designed to help us drive efficiency in our operations. I also think it's important for to us maintain discipline around pricing. Albeit the mix thing is hard for to us control, our pricing decisions are within our control and we have to stay disciplined on that. James, there might be color you want to add on expenses. I think our interest expense was down a little bit.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The operating expense line, really the focus ongoing right across the company, as John is referring to there, including Technology Solutions, and part of the business we've really been able to build our margins quite nicely. So directionally in line with what we were expecting, but we're certainly very pleased by the ongoing progress around our cost structure and our productivity.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. John, when you called out North America and some of the things you talked about, you did talk a little bit about Specialty in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe just give us a little more detail as far as what you saw for revenue growth there in the quarter, especially versus your expectations?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We expected our Specialty business to grow above market levels. And I think not only did it grow above market levels, it grew more than we had expected. And I think our strength in particular in our community-based oncology business was very strong. Clearly, U.S. oncology continues to perform well. Albeit off of a slightly smaller base, our multi-specialty business is growing very rapidly as we create value-differentiating capabilities in that market.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just on the follow-up side for the small acquisition that was made for Sainsbury, can you give us any indication as to what the earnings or financial impact will potentially be from that acquisition?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's obviously a very important strategic move for us. It significantly expands the presence of Lloyd's Pharmacies in the UK, and it's an endorsement of the strength of the Lloyd's brand and operating model. I think that's an important aspect to what this win signifies to our team and to the markets. James, you might want to comment on the timing and margin impact.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just based on our expected normal regulatory review process, we're expecting the transaction to close toward the end of February of this coming year, so I wouldn't expect it to have any material impact on fiscal 2016.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next we have Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks and good evening. James, I just want to follow up on the gross margins a little bit. This was probably \u2013 the gross margins are probably a little bit lower than what we had thought and maybe the lowest gross margin we've seen in five or six quarters, and I'm curious. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of what impacted that gross margin? I don't know if that was tied into the generic inflation comments or if there's something related to the purchasing synergies from Celesio having kicked in or Rite Aid or Omnicare. Can you give us a little bit better sense of what's go on there?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Really I would point you to two comments that we made during our prepared remarks. First of all, very strong growth from our largest customers and therefore an impact on the mix and the margin, the gross profit margin profile. So that's number one; and then secondarily, the lesser effect around generic price increases than we were originally expecting in our plan.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, maybe I can just follow up on that. John, for those who have been following the company for a while, you may recall we always used to talk about branded price inflation every quarter. And we went through a long period where we didn't talk about it, and now it feels like we're talking about it every quarter again. Has anything changed with respect to your relationship with the manufacturers and the IMAs [Inventory Management Agreements] that you've historically had in place? And how do we think about branded price inflation as a driver maybe relative to the size of like, for example, what generic price inflation has done for the company?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question. What's great about the business model that McKesson has been employing for a long time is that it has a lot of levers that we can use to help drive our performance over time. And as you point out, if you go way back to the early stages of my presence as the CEO, brand price inflation was the key driver that helped us drive our company. And over time, that became less important as a factor, but it always remained a factor. And so I think our comments today are more directional in nature related to our expectations brand price inflation came in higher than we anticipated. And as you point out, as we moved our model, we eliminated part of the variability or impact that branded price inflation has on our business model.","And also as you recall, at one point in our evolution, generic price deflation was something we had to manage quarter to quarter, and now we've been in a period where we've actually experienced some inflation. So our comments there, once again, are directional in nature that it came below where we had anticipated. But we believe both brand and generic price inflation will remain important tools for us as we look out this fiscal year and beyond.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just perhaps to add one thing, recall that around a fifth of our relationships with the branded manufacturers are variable in nature, so the other 80% are a fixed fee-for-service type of structure.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll move now to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. Sorry to go back to this again, but it does seem like the biggest change relative to the update we got from you guys at your Analyst Day. You're pointing out a mid-single-digit margin expansion in the Distribution Solutions business. And I'm just curious if there's any more detail you can give around how much of that lower margin expectation is just from revenue mix versus the less generic inflation that you guys have called out.","And I guess the bigger picture question, John, would just be given where Specialty is growing and the growth there, is margin expansion as we think about this business going forward, is it something that we should think about in a more tempered manner?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the point on margin is a good one. We clearly didn't anticipate our revenues to be growing as rapidly as they have. And that has, as James mentioned, had a depressing effect on op margin. But if you actually look at operating profit growth, it's still very strong. And our objective is to satisfy the needs of our customers. And as you know, we have long-term contracts with many of them. So as they grow, the bigger ones will put some pressure on the mix. But the most important dimension here is I think our focus on making sure that we are driving efficiency in our operations as revenue grows, and that was pointed out earlier from an expense perspective. And we're disciplined in the way we approach the market.","The comment about Specialty is an important one. That's a very high-growth area. Each company I think in the country probably defines specialty slightly differently, so it's difficult to talk to any one of us and get a perspective that's really industry-wide. From our point of view, there are some very profitable, positive mix products in the Specialty category, but there are also some products in the Specialty category that are really expensive and carry a margin rate that's low but produce tremendous returns and profit drop in the P&L. Albeit it may be dilutive to our margin expectations, they're certainly producing great returns. And I think that we have a responsibility to try to manage the company with both a perspective on margin rate as well as dollar growth and clearly at the bottom line the returns on our business. So we look at it in a portfolio way.","If there's one message you can take away from me on the Specialty business, it has been a priority for us now for many years. We came from a very weak position to now we are in a very strong position, and I'm very pleased with where we are in that market. And as we define it, I think in most of them we're either number one or number two and growing very rapidly. So we are well positioned as we think out and look at the new product launches. Those launches, given the characteristics of some of them, could put some pressure on our margin rates. But clearly, we think that they'll be value-creating, and we're in the right position to take advantage of the relationships we have with our customers in the markets that we serve.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful, and just a quick follow-up on the Celesio deal announced earlier today. Any sense you can give us on how we should think about the transaction as far as adding to your ultimate synergy target? And then the types of deals, is the type of deals we should expect to be building upon the Celesio acquisition?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Clearly, we are excited to have the business from a fundamental perspective beginning to stabilize and become more of a McKesson type of operation. We've always had a great view, a positive view of the resources and the people inside of Celesio. But as we talked about when we did the acquisition, there was some infrastructure and systems things we had to do and some strategy changes we had to make that would help us begin to get to a growth phase. I think we're entering the early stage of that growth phase. The deployment of capital we talked about as a possibility. You're beginning to see evidence of that.","This type of acquisition fits right in with what we want to do. It's in a market that's extremely friendly to the utilization of generics and the incentives for both wholesalers and retailers to help their patients take generics. And so when we have an opportunity to expand our channel of generics in an important market like the UK, it drives synergy across the entire corporation through our global procurement operations that we talked about.","So I think not only is it helpful to Celesio as a standalone opportunity and to LloydsPharmacy in particular, it's also helpful to McKesson overall as it builds on this 12,000 storefront base of business that we have out of the some odd 60,000 or 70,000 stores that we service, in the case of the 12,000 that are owned or banners of ours that buy off our portfolios. So it's important to recognize that pull-through buy power and the part of our strategy that this helps serve.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you so much.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So maybe on the Tech Solutions business. Obviously the reformation of that asset continues. It seems like the margin outlook for the year is good. If my math is right, is this going to be a year where we actually see EBIT growth and, not only that, but maybe get back to some of the higher levels of EBIT we saw historically? And secondarily, when do you actually think we can see some of the transactional businesses come through to where we could actually see the division grow again?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I appreciate the question, Ross. We have been, as you know, working diligently for the last several years to reposition the business in the areas where we think we are strong or market leading and where the markets are actually growing and are favorable to McKesson.","We have extremely strong franchises inside of our Technology Solutions business. And we have been struggling with our hospital IT business, where we have been reinvesting in the go-forward products and deinvesting in the products that we've already announced that we plan to sunset. And so it's difficult as an investor to see the positive momentum in the business through some the drag that's present as a result of, as you described, the reformation of the business as we position it for growth going forward. And I think we are optimistic that we continue to make the right decisions to get the momentum back in the business.","As to margins, I'll turn it over to James to talk a little bit about what you should think about there.","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we track towards that high-teens goal for fiscal 2016, I would say that right now we're looking at an increase in operating profit year over year, and that's excluding the $51 million benefit from the gain around the nurse triage business. So we're on track for some operating profit growth this year.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe, James, there's been some momentum in DC on a tax holiday or the ability to repatriate some cash. I think you guys have roughly $2 billion or so offshore. How would that change your more medium-term capital allocation priorities? I know you have some of the debt maturities and you have the Celesio put. One, is that something you've been thinking about? And, two, would that free you up maybe to do a little more repurchase if it happened?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We feel as though we have a very nice mix in terms of our cash balance between what's domestically and what's held offshore. And we have spoken a few times about \u2013 obviously, yes, we have the upcoming debt maturities to take care of. Those are U.S. dollar denominated. But beyond that, our priorities for capital allocation are, first of all, internal investment and, second, looking at value creating M&A opportunities.","And given the international breadth of our business now, we feel as though we have a nice balance in terms of the flexibility of the offshore cash that we have available for deployment as well as the domestic cash available for deployment. So we'll see how the tax discussions in Washington DC play out, but we already like the balance of cash that we have available to us, so we feel as though we have the degrees of freedom that we need.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll take Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple follow-up questions at this point. First, sorry to harp on this again, but regarding moderating generic inflation, could you characterize that a bit more? Was it across the board, in certain therapeutic classes, vendor, anything?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just observe that we saw fewer manufacturers taking increases on fewer drugs. So both of those variables we saw less activity than we had certainly seen last year during our first quarter and less than what we were assuming we would see when we put our plans together.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And you mentioned Celesio performed better than expected. Maybe I missed it, but could you comment on what area of Celesio specifically exceeded your expectation thus far? Was it on the synergy front, top line?","James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd say the revenue was really right on track on a constant currency basis with what we were expecting during the first year. We continued to see strong performance out of the United Kingdom businesses. And we're seeing some modest improvements in the German environment, where obviously we've had something of a history of market discounting. We're seeing a little improvement in that discounting environment in Germany. Offsetting that, the French market is still looking like a challenging one. But net-net, we're pleased with the progress that we made at Celesio in Q1, and we feel as though we have more opportunities for the balance of the year.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you comment on the Teva and Allergan transaction? Is that material or not with respect to generic inflation? Our objection is that as the generic industry consolidates, sometimes manufacturers raise price because they can. Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We clearly have a very strong working relationship with both Teva and Allergan. And I think that we see, as do you, that the question of generic inflation is sometimes driven by the ability for the price to actually benefit the generic manufacturers or otherwise stick in the marketplace. And so to the extent that the consolidation provides some of that opportunity, that would be a positive.","I think that the market remains competitive, and I think these consolidations will help eliminate costs. But I also think that McKesson's position in the market will continue to afford us an opportunity to work with these very large companies in a very positive way for both parties.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. And just any general thoughts around PCSK9 and how material that might be going forward? Maybe you can characterize the (47:07) benefit.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's difficult to tell. It's a little too early for to us comment on the characteristics of that product, albeit it is a positive, and the continued innovation that comes out in these categories of products will be extremely important to us going forward. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, our footprint in Specialty continues to grow. And I think that as people launch with some of these more unique products, it will help the patients, but it also will help McKesson.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll take George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. John, first a quick one, are there any situations where generic drug prices inflate where you guys don't benefit?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","George, I think drug price inflation and the benefit is in the eye of the beholder. I think all of us in the supply chain have different characteristics with manufacturers and with customers that are highly variable, including the relationships of both in terms of the way the business models work, but also the way the contractual relationships might work. So I think it's probably better said that we try to optimize our value to the generic companies in a way where we benefit and may benefit. But at the same time, we have to stay extremely disciplined and diligent around making sure that our customers are also benefiting through our action in the supply chain. And that's been our priority and will remain our priority.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a quick follow-up on the Sainsbury transaction. It's interesting that this the second deal like this that's occurred in a little over a month. And as you see global payer consolidation, do you foresee global pharmacy consolidation? And how do you guys feel like you're positioned if global retail pharmacy consolidation steps up? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a good question. Obviously, we've seen tremendous consolidation across healthcare in the last 90 days alone. There has been all kinds of activity.","I think the way we think about consolidation is clearly we want to be positioned with winners, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be always positioned with only scaled players. In fact, we think our Health Mart customers, for example, are winners and are able to consolidate in their own space with other independent pharmacies because of the scale we bring to them and the value we can deliver.","In fact, that's why I continue to focus on the footprint of owned and banner pharmacies, provide us the ability to help our customers would are perhaps not all owned by the same enterprise, continue to benefit through their relationship at McKesson and may be able to stay as independent operators. Even though they may appear on the surface to be subscale in terms of store count, they may improve their efficiencies through their partnership with us and clearly improve their margin structure through some of the value-added services that we help them deliver into the marketplace on behalf of payers and consumers.","So our focus is to help our customers be more successful across the board. And to the extent that people consolidate and we consolidate into our customers, we win or at least break even from a revenue perspective. And our objective is to continue to be more and more efficient with these larger customers so that we can earn the privilege of continuing to serve them.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll move next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good evening. John, let me take that answer and go a little bit further with it. To the extent that we are seeing consolidation among many players in the supply chain, including payers and obviously some on the retail side, do you foresee the need strategically or otherwise to potentially further consolidate and own additional assets within the supply chain, or are there inherent conflicts in that which will keep you from doing that? How do you best position the company to be most advantageously positioned going forward?","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a very good question. In fact, all of these questions are good questions. I think the industry is changing significantly. And I think it's incumbent upon us as it relates to our customers and our shareholders to remain open to any strategy that we think is sustainable and can create value. Having said that, it's always been our position that we don't compete with our customers. And so the challenge in some the conceived combinations would either have us competing with people that are on the partner\/supply side of our business or perhaps on the partner\/customer side of our business, and that makes it difficult to conceive of some of those types of combinations. So I think that we remain open to everything. We'll be very cautious before we ever cross the line of competing with our customers.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thank you.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn it over to the speakers for any closing or additional remark.","John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great, thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2016, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to driving better business health for our customers every day. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for her review of upcoming events in the financial community.","Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, John.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments.

Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2013 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported third quarter results with total company revenues of $31.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.41.","Distribution Solutions continues to turn in solid results, and our view of the full year operating performance of the business has improved from our original expectations. However, third quarter financial results in the Distribution Solutions segment were impacted by a $40 million pretax charge related to a legal dispute in our Canadian business.","In our Technology Solutions segment, again our primary businesses performed well in the third quarter, and our view of their full year operating performance remains unchanged. Third quarter results and our view for the full year are impacted by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business. So overall for the full year, our improved outlook of the operating performance and Distribution Solutions allows us to offset the revenue deferral in our international technology business and much of the charge in our Canadian business. As a result, we are updating our outlook for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.10 to $7.30 for fiscal 2013.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. pharmaceutical business led the way with solid operating results for the quarter.","We continue to benefit from our strong and long-standing relationships with brand manufacturers, where we deliver a broad range of value-added services and remain a valued supply chain partner. We also continue to benefit from the growth in generic pharmaceuticals. In calendar 2012, we saw the largest number of generic launches the industry has seen to date, and we are pleased to deliver great value to our generics customers with the breadth of our portfolio, our supply chain expertise and our high service levels. Compared to calendar 2012, calendar 2013 stands out for the particularly low number of expected generic launches for the year. And we have talked publicly about the challenge that creates for our U.S. pharmaceutical business in our fiscal 2014. That said, we also view the opportunities in our generics business in the following years quite favorably. So we remain excited about the future of this business and our opportunity to continue to bring innovative services, technology and products to support the future growth in generics.","Turning to our results in Canada. Our Canadian distribution business had solid revenue and gross profit growth in the core operations of the business in the third quarter. We are approaching the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Katz Banner business, and as I've mentioned in previous quarters, we remain very pleased with this acquisition. We continue to see good growth in the number of independent pharmacies operating within the acquired Katz Banner business, and we use trade names like Drug Trading and the Medicine Shoppe Canada to grow our business.","McKesson Canada has a long history of supporting independent pharmacy through our banner offering. We have a strong track record of improving the efficiency of store operations and providing great value for our banner members who also benefit from the focused leadership team in McKesson Canada dedicated to developing and delivering services tailored to the needs of the independent pharmacy.","We continue to see tremendous momentum in our Medical-Surgical business as we benefit from the growth in our alternate site markets and our ability to win new customers and certainly from the contribution from tuck-in acquisitions. Our McKesson Medical-Surgical customers from the small physician practice to larger groups of physicians practicing as part of an integrated delivery network see increasing value in working with a partner who understands the unique requirements and challenges of the physician business.","With respect to the acquisition of PSS World Medical, we were pleased to receive notification of early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act at the end of the third quarter. This was an important step in the process of completing our acquisition of PSS. I've had the opportunity to spend time with key members of both our Medical-Surgical team and the PSS team. They're all excited about the opportunities they see to combine the best of both businesses and bring increased valued to our physician and extended care customers. We expect to close the acquisition during our fourth quarter, and I'm looking forward to welcoming the PSS team members into McKesson.","In summary, I'm pleased with the operating performance in our Distribution Solutions segment for the third quarter, and I'm confident in our improved outlook for our full year operating performance.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the third quarter, revenues were flat, and adjusted operating margins were 11.9%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Q3 results were impacted by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business. For those of you who may not be familiar with our international business, let me take a moment to give you a brief overview. Our international technology business offers workforce and healthcare system solutions primarily in the United Kingdom. Our workforce solutions help the National Health Service recognize the full benefits of their electronic staff records as a strategic workforce management system. And our healthcare solutions deliver a range of technology products to hospitals, surgery centers and clinics throughout the United Kingdom.","In fiscal 2012, we acquired a software provider in the U.K. called System C. System C brings updated systems to our acute care customer base, and we've been pleased with the customer response to our expanded offering and the resulting bookings experienced in the business. As we enhanced our products to address the evolving needs of the market and as we work with our customers on the pace of implementations, we have determined it is appropriate to defer revenue on certain products to future periods. This decision impacts our outlook for the rest of the year, which Jeff will discuss in further detail in his remarks.","Moving on to the rest of our Technology Solutions segment. Our RelayHealth business and our payer software business, which combined to contribute just over 50% of the operating profits of the segment, continue to perform well and deliver steady growth. Customers are increasingly seeking the technology in our RelayHealth business as they look to establish clinical and financial connections between healthcare providers in the community. RelayHealth is an important partner, delivering innovative solutions to efficiently manage revenue cycle. And we also help providers better engage patients in their care and collaborate with the patient's other providers regardless of their technology infrastructure.","For our payer customers, healthcare reform has created an intense focus on reducing administrative waste and finding new ways to work with providers to become more connected and, in some cases, to share risk for patient care and outcomes. As the largest solutions provider for payers in the U.S., McKesson understands the technology and analytics required to best support both payers and providers as they experiment with new models in patient care.","And finally, turning to our Provider Technologies business. Approximately 1 year ago, we announced a series of product strategy changes in our hospital business to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle solutions onto the Paragon platform. We are pleased that more customers than we had originally anticipated have either already moved to Paragon or have confirmed their intention to move to Paragon. We're also very pleased that Paragon was once again named the Best in Class in the Community Hospital Information Systems category for the seventh consecutive year. In addition, Paragon was rated #2 in overall software suite rankings for the second consecutive year, reflecting the attractiveness of the solution to the large hospital marketplace.","In summary, the core operating performance in our Distribution Solutions business remains solid, and our outlook for the full year has improved from our original expectations. While we are disappointed with the revenue deferral in our international business, the primary businesses in Technology Solutions continue to perform well.","We're fortunate to be in businesses that generate healthy cash flows. And over time, we've used our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders. Consistent with this approach, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors increased the company share repurchase program by $500 million. We also expect to close our acquisition of PSS World Medical late in our fiscal fourth quarter. The strength of our business provides us the continued financial flexibility to create value for our shareholders through our capital deployment program, which continues to be portfolio-based.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased by the operating strength in our Distribution Solutions business as we look towards the full year, and the primary businesses in our Technology Solutions segment continue to perform well.","There are a number of complexities to our results this quarter, which I'll try to sort out as we walk through our financial results. I would summarize now, however, by saying there were 3 aspects to our financial results that I would draw particular attention to this afternoon. First, and perhaps most important when thinking about our business going forward, is the nice strength we are seeing in our Distribution Solutions segment operating results as we look towards the full year. Second, is the charge we took for the legal dispute in our Canadian business of $40 million, which, to be clear, we do include in our adjusted earnings. Third is the revenue deferral in our international business and Technology Solutions. I'll cover each of these as I go through my remarks.","My comments today on our earnings will focus on our $1.41 adjusted earnings per share, which, as you recall, excludes 3 types of items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I will review in my discussion today will be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release.","Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues were up 1% to $31.2 billion for the quarter, as we again see a large volume of brand-to-generic conversions slowing our revenue growth. This is, of course, a good thing for our business, and you see this in looking at our adjusted gross profit, which grew 6% to $1.7 billion.","Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter increased 13% to $1.1 billion. While this increase seems large on its face, there were 3 primary drivers to this increase. First, the $40 million pretax charge in our Canadian business represented approximately 4% of this expense growth. To provide a little background for this, as we've previously reported in our SEC filings, McKesson has for a number of years cooperated and responded to an investigation by the agency known as RAMQ, which is a provincial government agency with authority over the conduct of pharmaceutical business in the province of Qu\u00e9bec.","In the third quarter of 2013, we engaged in settlement discussions to resolve potential legal claims against the company and our customers and suppliers. In consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions, which are at an advanced stage, we recorded a pretax charge of $40 million for the estimated probable loss from potential legal claims arising from the investigation.","Turning back to the overall increase in operating expense. The second factor was the acquisitions we've made over the last year, which added roughly another 3% to our expense growth. Finally, our corporate expenses for the quarter are up $27 million year-over-year, which was approximately another 3% of the operating expense growth for the total company.  Let me remind you, though, that we typically see a fair amount of variability from quarter-to-quarter in our corporate expense line.  For the full year, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat versus the prior year. Adjusting for all 3 of these factors, our overall operating expenses are tracking more in line with the normal growth we would expect.","Other income for the quarter was $10 million. As a reminder, last year's third quarter other income was impacted by an asset impairment recorded in our corporate segment. Interest expense declined $6 million versus the prior year to $58 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012.","As I projected on our earnings call last quarter, we did proceed with issuing $900 million in long-term debt in December to refinance the $400 million in debt that was repaid in February 2012 and to prefund a $500 million maturity coming due this March. So to be very clear, the December $900 million financing was just a refinancing of existing debt and is independent of the PSS transaction.","To turn to the financing for PSS, our latest thinking is that we will likely finance a little less than 1\/2 of the transaction with permanent debt sometime subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. We now have a bridge facility in place to fund the close itself.","Moving now to taxes. In the third quarter, we recognized some unfavorable discrete tax items, which drove our adjusted tax rate up to 32% for the quarter. We continue, however, to estimate that our full year adjusted tax rate will remain at 30.5%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $340 million, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.41.","To wrap up our consolidated results, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% for the quarter to $240 million. This year-over-year decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. For the full year, we continue to expect our average diluted shares to come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares outstanding.","Let's turn now to our segment adjusted earnings results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 4% year-over-year for the quarter to $22.4 billion. The key drivers of this were market growth and having one extra sales day.","Our warehouse revenues declined 14% year-over-year as the large volume of brand-to-generic conversions particularly impacts our warehouse revenues. While our total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues are roughly in line with our expectations year-to-date, we have seen a shift of existing customer business from warehouse to direct store delivery.","Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 3% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth and having one extra sales day in the quarter.","Medical-Surgical revenues were up a strong 15% for the quarter to $874 million, driven by market growth and new customers. The quarter also benefited from an acquisition and from having one extra sales day. These 2 items combined, however, account for only about 4% of the overall 15% growth. So we are particularly pleased to see this kind of continued strong growth in our Medical-Surgical business. And with the acquisition of PSS expected to close later this quarter, we are well positioned to carry this momentum forward.","Adjusted gross profit in Distribution Solutions increased 7% for the quarter to $1.3 billion, representing an adjusted gross margin improvement of 24 basis points versus the prior year. We did, of course, have strong growth in oral generic profits this quarter. However, the increase in generic profit was partially offset by the expected decline in sell margin that was primarily driven by the BA.","In addition, while our view of our brand manufacturer economics for the full year has grown more positive relative to our original expectations, less came in the third quarter and more has shifted to the fourth quarter. One other point, we did benefit in the third quarter from $8 million in antitrust settlements.","Our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expenses were up 15% for the quarter to $725 million. Once you factor out the $40 million pretax charge as well as the various acquisitions, the number is more in line with what we would usually expect. The adjusted operating margin rate for the segment was 187 basis points this quarter versus 191 basis points a year ago. For the full year fiscal 2013, we continue to expect Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin improvement in the high-single-digit basis points. Eventually, the operating strength we are seeing across the segment should at least offset the charge for the legal dispute in our Canadian business.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were flat for the quarter at $826 million. The revenue deferrals that John discussed in our International business lowered our revenues in the quarter by approximately $16 million, and we have lowered our full year expectation by approximately $30 million. These revenues essentially would have fallen straight to the bottom line. As a result, adjusted operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $98 million, and our adjusted operating margin was 11.9%. This is obviously below our original expectations.","As a result of these developments, turning to the full year, we still expect our revenues in MTS to approximate the level of growth experienced in fiscal 2012. The weaker revenues we now expect in our international business will be roughly offset by the acquisitions we closed in the third quarter.","On the operating margin side, we now expect our adjusted operating margin in Technology Solutions to approximate the level we saw in fiscal 2012.","Leaving our segment performance and turning now to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $10 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.7 billion, and our days sales outstanding were unchanged to 25 days. Inventories were flat for the quarter at $10.4 billion, with our days sales in inventory of 32 days also flat to prior year. Compared to a year ago, payables were down 4% to $15 billion. Our days sales in payables of 46 days was 2 days below last year.","Year-to-date, we've generated $276 million in operating cash flow. As you know, our cash flow varies from quarter to quarter depending on seasonal and timing factors. In addition, as Paul Julian talked about at our Investor Day in June, earlier this year, our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business opened a new national redistribution center through which we flow a significant portion of our inventory. We have managed this transition conservatively and have built up some extra inventory to ensure we meet customer needs. This is lower than our operating cash flow year-to-date, but as the transition is close to conclusion, overall we do not expect it to have an impact on our full year. So we continue to expect our cash flows from operations for the full year to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, though I do think it's more likely now that we'll be in the low end of that range.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. Of this amount, approximately $1.5 billion was offshore. Our capitalized spending was $268 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, and we now expect to come in a little bit below the low end of our prior range of $425 million to $475 million. Overall, our gross debt to capital ratio was 37% for the quarter and remains within our target range of 30% to 40%.","We did spend roughly $360 million on share repurchases in the third quarter. And as John mentioned earlier, we are pleased that the Board of Directors recently approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total share repurchase authorization outstanding to $1.1 billion, giving us additional flexibility to deploy our capital and maximize shareholder value in a variety of ways.","Now I'll turn to our outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter were impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, the $40 million pretax charge for a legal dispute in our Distribution Solutions segment had a negative impact of approximately $0.12 per diluted share for the quarter and for the full year. Second, the revenue deferrals and slower implementations in our international technology business and our Technology Solutions segment lowered our adjusted earnings by approximately $0.05 this quarter. Full year impact is expected to be about $0.09 per diluted share. Third, our full year expectation for our other businesses, primarily in Distribution Solutions, has improved by about $0.16 per diluted share, and essentially all of this increase will be seen in our March quarter.","As a result of these 3 items, we are updating our guidance for the year on adjusted earnings from $7.15 to $7.35 to a new range of $7.10 to $7.30. The new range remains within our original guidance range of $7.05 to $7.35 that we issued at the beginning of this fiscal year, but we've now narrowed the top end of that range by $0.05.","Turning back to the December quarter results for just a minute, I would say that relative to our expectations, our December quarter results also reflect a timing shift into our March quarter in 2 areas, both of which I've discussed: brand manufacturer economics and taxes.","Now as John mentioned, when you think about fiscal 2014, you have a big drop off in new generic launches, which we've said for a long time represents a challenge for us. Of course, we run the company for the long term, and over the next several years, we are quite positive about generic launches. We are beginning our detailed planning process for the next fiscal year and working hard to make the right decisions in the coming months to position the company for the short-term challenges and the long-term opportunities.","One final point about our fiscal 2013 outlook. In terms of guidance on our non-GAAP adjustments, I would remind you that our convention is to not include any forward impact from acquisitions on our guidance until the acquisitions have actually closed. With that in mind, we expect $0.55 per amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and due to the AWP litigation charges we recorded in the first half of the fiscal year, we are assuming $0.15 for litigation reserve adjustments. Also, including the impact, the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.13.","In summary, we've had 3 solid quarters and our view of the operating results of our primary businesses remains strong. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question, John, on the Med-Surg business. Clearly, 15% is really strong. Jeff talked about the extra day in the acquisitions being 4%, but 11% growth. Can you talk about where that's coming from? And how you see that business evolving? Was part of this flu and therefore more onetime-ish, or are you seeing a pickup in the overall business?","John H. Hammergren","I think we're seeing a pickup in the overall business, Lisa. I think we're doing a better job of penetrating our existing customer base from a sales perspective, selling more of what they need to run their practices. And clearly in the alternate site markets, we're growing rapidly in home care and extended care. I also would say that I think we are gaining some additional new customers as we progress with our value proposition in our offering. We're making our sales force more efficient through the productivity tools we're giving them so they have more time to spend with the customers, and we're providing tools to our customers, frankly, so they can order more efficiently from us. I would also say that the flu impact as we began to see it was more late in December. We might see some of it in our fourth quarter. I mean clearly, the January and February effects we'll see -- it won't really be that material on Med-Surg. But it's an important part of our business, and clearly we are seeing an uptake in physician office visits and emergency room visits, et cetera, in our industry. But I think overall, it's just kind of solid momentum across the board and almost all of the businesses that comprise Med-Surg and continued traction with the value proposition we've given to our customers.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, Jeff. But when we think about the technology and the deferred revenue, the $16 million and the $30 million, can you give us an idea of when that will ultimately be recognized?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, the reality as we sit here today, Lisa, is we have a situation where we've got a lot of bookings, a lot of implementations, a lot of customers who like the product, but a structure where that revenue is liable to be sitting on our balance sheet for an extended period of time. And so I can't give you a solid end point sitting here today. I would tell you that as we think about our FY '14 plans, that revenue is unlikely to reverse in FY '14 even. And so the magnitude of the challenge I just described in '13 is liable to be somewhat replicated in FY '14.","John H. Hammergren","Yes, I will also just add to Jeff's comments here, I think we're excited about the progress the team is making in getting customers on board with our value proposition. But in the near term, with that revenue rec issue being out in front of us, we actually probably are booking more expenses in the near term and it can't be delayed, and the revenue gets delayed as we get these implementations done and continue to build up the value of the product for our customers. So it actually has a compounding effect. The success of the bookings raises expenses, and the revenue gets delayed as we try to get it. Now we are getting the cash though, and so I think there's an indication that products are working and our customers are happy. It really is just an issue of making sure that we've met the obligations and the requirements our customers have in front of us before we can actually book the revenue.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Just to be very clear on the accounting, Lisa and John. So all of the expenses associated with these customers, we just book ratably as we incur it. That's why I made the comment earlier that I described the revenue that's being deferred is really revenue that...","John H. Hammergren","It's almost...","Jeffrey C. Campbell","We would have, and when it hits the P&L, will be almost 100% earnings.","John H. Hammergren","Right.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess just on the drug business or actually the Distribution business, obviously Med-Surg did a little bit better. On the drug side, you mentioned maybe branded price inflation or benefits from branded price have gone up a little bit. But can you give us some more understanding of what's driving a pretty big upside, I guess, in the distribution business overall versus what your expectations were?","John H. Hammergren","I think that it's really across the board, Tom. I think the branded guys -- or excuse me, the distribution guys are really performing very well. They're focused in executing well across the board. As Jeff mentioned, we do see continued strength in our relationships with the branded manufacturers. Frankly, most of that strength will be realized in our fourth quarter as we've seen the progression of what's transpired early in this calendar year. So I think we are feeling good about what's going on. Our Canadian business, setting aside the charge, is performing well. And I think our generic business is executed very well as well. So -- and I think that we've -- we're in pretty good shape in that business and are executing well.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess just as a follow-up. Any color you can offer within the specialty business, whether it be sort of the traditional side or the US Oncology side?","John H. Hammergren","I think we're actually having strength across the board also in specialty. I think we've seen a nice ramp in customers who have either already joined or indicated an interest in joining our US Oncology Network, which, as you know, is the most intimate of the relationships we have with our customers in that space. Our value proposition there is quite expansive, and as customers come under pressure, clearly US Oncology is an alternative that I think most folks are considering. One of the things we're tracking a lot now is what benefit are our customers realizing by being part of the US Oncology Network and is that benefit improving year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. And I can tell you, we're tracking very nicely for our customers as it relates to their performance under these programs with us. So that's a real positive. And I do think that the segment overall continues to be poised for a good growth as we look forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just at the end of the prepared comments, you guys -- you mentioned something along the lines of working hard to make the right decisions regarding short-term challenges in fiscal '14. And I guess, are you generally referring to potential uses of balance sheet capacity when you say that, or are there other things you're referring to with that comment? Just trying to get more color on that.","John H. Hammergren","Yes, I think we look at our opportunities in fiscal '14, both from a headwind and a tailwind perspective, et cetera, how are we going to position for an environment where generics are going to grow slower than they have historically. Now I think everybody understands it's going to be difficult for us to fill the gap year-on-year on the performance related to what drove -- what was driven by generics. But from time to time, not unlike any company of our size, we have to review ways in which we might become even more efficient and be more effective as an organization. We have a very strong culture of Six Sigma and continuous improvement in our business, and we're always thinking about things that we can do to optimize our facilities or consolidate various systems to get the potential outcome -- best potential outcome we can for our company. There's always trade-offs in making these decisions, and we have to be careful about the kinds of things we might consider. But clearly, we want to be lean and mean, and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to optimize our performance in '14. But the most important thing for us to do in '14 is not to impact negatively our trajectory going into '15, because we see this hiatus of generics in the next year as not something that's a permanent reset in the way our business operates but a temporary year-on-year comparison that we'll get through, and then as we get into the next year, we're going to be poised once again to experience the type of growth that we have historically. So that's really what we're looking at, and I think we want to be as efficient as we can be.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","The other thing I might remind you of, Steve, is as we always point out when we first provide guidance for the year, when we're providing guidance, we always exclude any potential future material litigation reserve adjustments or acquisitions divestitures or material charges that we take because of any restructuring decisions we might make.","Operator","And we'll go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Actually, I think everybody's thinking along the same lines, most of my questions have been asked. But I'm just curious if you could give a little more detail, Jeff, on your comments on the corporate expense being up $27 million in the quarter. Was there anything specific to call out realizing the full year is somewhat normal? And then this may be difficult, but as a follow-up, just with the Canadian legal settlement, do you believe with the $40 million you've taken to full magnitude of the potential outcome or could there be additional charges taken that would be material enough to call out in the future?","John H. Hammergren","Well, let me maybe do those in reverse order. On the Canadian charge, we clearly think the $40 million is the right reserve because that's what we booked. I would emphasize that those are discussions that are at a very advanced stage, so nothing is over until it's over. But I would say, Eric, that gives us a pretty high level of confidence that we have the right number and that's the end of it. On corporate expenses, you are right. They vary a lot quarter-to-quarter. I suppose one of the realities of being a company founded in 1833 is sometimes we have history. So last year, we had an old -- a little bit of an asset impairment in that line. This year, you have things like a environmental charge we took that relates to the chemical business we were once in, and it's a pretty sizable charge. So over the course of a year, all those things tend to kind of net out. And that's why I feel pretty good when I look at that corporate expense line and what we're projecting for the full year, and it's pretty flattish. This year, just because of the timing of the way things happened in last year's December quarter versus this year's December quarter, with the example I just gave you of environmental -- significant environmental charge, it looks tough year-over-year. But I don't think there's anything that you need to think about or model in from a run rate perspective.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, I just want to follow up on the healthcare IT guidance for this fiscal year. It sounds like you're expecting the margin there to be slightly below the long-term target of mid-teens. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly as you referred back to last year's fiscal operating profit number. And then looking out longer term, any reason to think that, that mid-teens goal is not -- still intact beyond to this fiscal year?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","No, it would work backwards. Certainly, our goal has not changed at all, and it's obviously frustrating and disappointing to us that a change in how we view what's going on in the -- that international technology business in terms of the rev rec is going to keep us from getting to it for the year. To be clear, for the year, yes. If you go back and you look at the operating margin last year, our guidance is we should -- you should see revenue growth off last year's revenue similar to the kind of growth we had last year, which was 4%. And the operating margin will be pretty flat to last year, so that gives you a pretty tight band in which you can think about the operating profit of that segment.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just if I could follow up on the new authorization, I think that brings the total buyback now to over $1 billion. I wasn't sure how much buyback would play into fiscal fourth quarter or to next year given the proposed acquisition. I guess is there any message or direction you'd care to give us around the potential buyback as we think about next fiscal year?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we never like to tell people exactly when we're going to be buying stock back and when we're not. I think there's a couple of important messages here. One is that we continue to have -- be in great cash businesses, and we have a very strong balance sheet. So even with the upcoming $2.1 billion acquisition of PSS, we're confident that you will see some level of continued share repurchase, albeit obviously lower than it would have been if we weren't buying PSS. And I think the incremental authorization that the board gave us this week is a sign of all of our confidence in the future and where we're going as a company.","Operator","We'll go next to George Hill with Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just number -- first, Jeff, I know that you're loath to talk about fiscal '14, but is there any chance you'd give us directionally some quantification of the headwind with the contribution of generic conversions in fiscal '13 versus the headwind that you'll face in fiscal '14?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","George, we have not taken a cut at it because one thing we certainly learned is that the world of generic launches changes every week. And that's why when we give you guidance in late April or early May, we'll be very precise on what we're assuming. When we go to make those assumptions, I make the observation that we're using the same data that is available to everyone publicly. And so I've seen several people take estimates at this, and it's a big number. And the estimates range just like our own estimates range, but it's a big number. But I don't want to -- if I gave you a number today, I'm sure I'd have to give you a different number in 3 months because the world will change.","John H. Hammergren","No, I think it's also fair to say, George, that generic is but one component of our overall performance, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that we've -- we're piling up more tailwinds than we have headwinds. Now, it's always an ongoing battle, and we're not finished with our planning for next year. But I think that's why Jeff is a little reluctant to say, well, here's the challenge generics might be. First of all, we don't necessarily know the full number yet because our teams are still working on what their projections are going to be. And secondly, hopefully, there'll be other things that are going in our favor that will help minimize that effect to the extent that we can.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. And then maybe, John, just a quick strategic follow-up. I want to follow on Steve's question. It sounds like what you're telling us strategically regarding fiscal '14 is that while generics are a tough comp, expense ratio versus profit levels might seem a little higher in fiscal '14. But you guys want to stay at a strategic level given the long-term profile or the growth profile of the business, I guess, am I thinking about that right? It sounds like you're telling us you don't want to be in a position of having to cut expenses given the opportunity despite the challenges in '14.","John H. Hammergren","Right. I think the way you should interpret what I said was that like anybody else, we have an opportunity to look at where you can tighten the belt and what steps you can make and the rock you haven't lifted in a couple of years might be lifted and provided an opportunity. And I think what we're saying is that in the next several months, we are going to be focused on how do we provide more momentum going into FY '14, to some of the measures we can control, things we can do, and it could be our sourcing activities, even our indirect sourcing activities and things like copy paper, how do we refine what we do to reduce our spending as much as we can. But the real message I was leaving you was we're not going to do anything to the company in fiscal '14 because I mean structurally, like shutting down 1\/2 our distribution centers, et cetera, because we believe our growth trajectory is going to come back as we look at fiscal '15 and beyond. And so this is not an issue of an industry reset where the distribution business is going to lose significant volumes and therefore we have to restructure our cost. I think this is an opportunity for us to just be responsible and be reflective and make sure that we're positioning the company properly as we come back into what we think will be more promising years ahead.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff and John, you've mentioned some deal-related costs for transactions that had closed this year as contributing to the cost in the third quarter. Any indication how quickly those will drop off?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, we gather, Bob, in our acquisition-related expense line anything that is directly related to either the transaction costs, so something large like PSS when we get there. It will be things like the cost of doing the bridge loan, et cetera. We also put in there integration costs, restructuring costs as you go about consolidating facilities, et cetera. So when we -- what is a little confusing about that line, however, this year is we have this unusual accounting earlier in the year where we have a very large gain related to buying the other 50% of our headquarters building we didn't previously own. If you strip that out, it looks like a more normal number. So as the other thing, just to be very clear, is what's -- what we've got in there in the 9 months year-to-date is obviously anything that has been incurred related to a transaction that we have announced. So, for example, there's a little bit of PSS cost in the year-to-date, about $6 million and the -- related to PSS because we incurred those costs subsequent to announcing it. But as I give you guidance for the March quarter on those numbers, we haven't closed PSS, so I'm not including in those estimates, all of the costs that we will in fact incur at the time we close PSS because it would still be an estimate. So, boy, if I -- listening to myself, I know I made this very, very confusing.","John H. Hammergren","I think one of the positives about providing adjusted earnings is that we take some of that complexity out. And so when Jeff spent the last portion of his prepared remarks talking about these items, I believe all of those items are actually adjusted out. And so that was meant to help you reconcile between adjusted and GAAP as opposed to some flavor on onetime issues in the quarter that were adjusted -- the one, our -- the Canadian issue and those other issues flowed through earnings and were not adjusted. And when we talk about litigation-related expenses, for example, they're related to very specific litigation items, of which primarily AWP, maybe all AWP and this RAMQ thing, for example, doesn't get adjusted out. So we've ...","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Just in operating [indiscernible]...","John H. Hammergren","We've tried to be pretty specific about what we put in and what we put out, and that was a bit of a reconciliation.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I will follow up on that. Is it possible that you could just give us any kind of clue as to how PSS World did in the quarter. I doubt we are going to see those results ever. Will we?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, you probably will see their results because as an SEC registrant who's independent, and we obviously can't speak for PSS because we don't own them today, they have an SEC filing requirement and they will be filing their Q in early February in line with their filing obligations. And I would estimate that we'll be closing around the end of February.","Operator","And I'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you've seen a shift from warehouse to direct sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what's driving this change? Is this is a specific client or is this something that you're seeing -- a change that you're seeing in the marketplace? And do you expect it also to continue into your -- the March quarter?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","We only have a few customers in our warehouse line. And the warehouse line has been partially negatively affected by the move to generics. When a brand moves to generic, many of these customers will -- first of all, it goes down in price. Secondly, it may be sourced on a direct basis where otherwise, it might have been a warehouse item. But the phenomena moving to direct clearly is a separate issue, and I think our customers see tremendous value in the service we provide in a direct model. And so several of our customers have said I know we used the warehouse and that sells -- shifts into our warehouses, we prefer to have you manage this directly to our store so we don't have to go through the supply chain expense of handling it ourselves. So there's lots of reasons people would pick to do that. But generally speaking, I think our customers see value in going on a direct model with us.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So should I think about it as partially a revenue mix? Because to your point, some of the warehouse revenues are coming out of the system because the brand goes to generic and partly also in incremental dollar growth in direct-store sales, assuming our associate with higher margins around customers to see that value, basically 2 separate drivers?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes. So -- and then to be clear, Ricky, this is really relative to our expectations for the year. The very good news to John's point is while we knew warehouse revenues were going to have a significant downward hit from the brand-to-generic conversions because it's all brand product, we have seen more of an offset than we expected as the handful -- less than a handful really of customers that John was talking about have chosen to put a little bit more through the direct channel than the warehouse channel. It's a very good thing for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, maybe if I can just also go back to some of the items that you said at the end of your prepared comments as we think about, I guess, the rest of fiscal '13. I got most of it here. You talked obviously about the $0.12 for Canada, the, I guess, $0.05 for the deferred rev, $0.04 in the fourth quarter. And then you mentioned this $0.16 benefit from the other businesses. I think I missed part of your comments, if you could just kind of explain that again.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, Charles, I'm happy to reprise the math because it is a little -- our results are not as simple as we might have hoped this quarter. But the charge in Canada equates to $0.12. And then the full year impact relative to our expectations of the revenue deferrals in our international business is $0.09. So that would -- if there were nothing else going on, you'd think we would take our guidance range down by the $0.21. The very good news is we're feeling much more positive about the full year results across really all of our other businesses, although it is primarily distribution. And that's about $0.16 of upsides. And that's why if you look at what do we do with our guidance range versus 90 days ago, we've only moved it down $0.05, despite the challenge of the $0.12 of the charge in Canada.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then part of that $0.16, is it fair to think that it's also part of the brand economics or is that sort of a separate issue then?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","That would certainly be one driver.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Could you guys talk a little bit more about the -- you said there was a better-than-expected uptick in the Paragon conversions. Is there any way you can sort of size sort of how many McKesson Horizon hospitals have converted so far or sort of what gives you comfort in that statement?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I guess, we typically don't talk about customer accounts by products and in certain markets who's buying what. I guess the comment or the discussion was meant to provide some confidence with our stakeholders that the Paragon product line is being well received. And that many of our customers that had been using the Horizon product line that have been faced with a serious question about the consideration of Paragon versus the consideration of other alternatives that more than we had expected are actually committing to Paragon and moving forward with that decision. We've also made tremendous progress with Horizon. Our customers are stable, our implementations have gone well, people are getting to Meaningful Use attestation, and our products are coming GA at the time frame that we had expected. And our Paragon roadmap is solid and remains on track as well. Our emergency department product is now GA-ed or getting close to GA-ing. Our reviews with the firms that have been helping us to make sure that we're on track on the development perspective are pleased. And as I mentioned in my comments, class has now rated the product for the seventh year in a row Best in Class for Community Healthcare. But I think surprisingly -- surprising to some, not to us, but to some, the product is now rated basically #2 in the marketplace overall because of its ease of use, its integration and its cost of ownership. So we're really pleased with the  customer satisfaction really across the board, even when you think about the larger hospitals that are moving from Horizon to Paragon. It's going quite well.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","That's great. Will Horizon bring hospitals through Stage 2 and 3 of Meaningful Use?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, we're committed to making our customers successful. I don't want to get too specific about the specific individual customers. But clearly, Meaningful Use is important to us. And we want these customers to get there, and we'll help them get there on Horizon and on Paragon.","Operator","And we'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John and Jeff, if I listen to what you're saying about the fourth quarter, by my math, it kind of feels like you need over an 80-basis-point sequential improvement in your op margin and Distribution Solutions to kind of get to the midpoint of your range. And I understand there's some noise in the 3Q number. But given that you told us over the years that you're not as dependent on price inflation and, John, I think you called out some branded manufacture economics, is it all coming on the branded side? And what's really driving it? Is it the price inflation in 1Q? Like what drives such a huge sequential increase like that?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, let me just remind you, Glen, of one thing, which is while there is only a modest piece of our annual economics with brand manufacturers that is price dependent, even for the portion where we know what we're going to make in a year, the timing of which quarter we get it can still be completely driven by price increases. And so what we clearly saw this year as they shipped out of the December quarter and into the March quarter, so I mean your -- I haven't done the math maybe exactly the way you did, but we're quite confident in the guidance we've given. If it checks out with the math you've done, yes, we will have a very unusually strong March quarter driven by all parts of our business. But the timing of those brand economics will be a significant piece of it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if I could just follow up, Jeff. In the press release, in one of the footnotes, you said that in the third quarter and first 9 months, you recorded a product alignment charge in the Tech Solutions business of $42 million. And I went back to the past releases and never saw this charge before. And I'm wondering when did you record these charges?","Jeffrey C. Campbell","That was -- actually that was last December quarter when we -- a year ago when we made the decision to make Paragon the key...","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Oh, I get it, okay. So that's all part of that. There's nothing in this quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just quickly on the PSS financing and sort of where we are, can you just remind us when you gave sort of your initial assumptions around the transaction, what your assumptions were around financing? It feels like it might be more cash now. And so I'm just trying to figure out sort of what's changed in that mix versus when it was originally reported.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Yes, I may have confused people, Ross. We really have not previously given any assumptions about financing. To help people just with the math, what I said when we first announced it was, look, if you're thinking about what kind of earnings will it generate in the first 12 months, if you were to assume we 100% financed it at 4% debt, you would have $0.15 to $0.25 of accretion. I didn't mean to imply we were going to 100% finance it. It was just a way to help people be very clear on the math. Accretion's kind of a funny number when you think about it in isolation for a transaction of this size because, of course, we would have done something else with the cash if we hadn't bought -- if we weren't buying PSS. So I'd caution people about being purely incremental on the accretion related to this.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","John H. Hammergren","Excellent. Thank you very much, Amber, and thank you also for joining us on the call today. I'm very pleased with our operating performance in Distribution Solutions, including the strong momentum in our Medical-Surgical business, as we move closer to completing our acquisition of PSS World Medical. I continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers by helping them improve their business health and their ability to connect with other stakeholders and ultimately deliver better care to their patients. And like always, I want to thank our McKesson associates for their hard work and focus on our customers' success. I now will hand the call over to Erin for a review of our upcoming events for the financial community.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events.

Erin will provide additional background and context for our view of LIFO-related adjustments in her remarks.","Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit growth of 27%. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business once again led the way with outstanding results for the quarter. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations for strong growth for the year. We also experienced strong growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, driven in part by favorable pricing in the first quarter.","As you know, we have a strong and proven track record with our various generics programs. Our management team has done a great job of not only growing our generics footprint but also building our relationships with our manufacturing partners across the globe. McKesson remains well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value that we provide across our extensive generic offering. There's no better evidence of the value we provide through our generic programs than the voice of our customer, and our customers continue to purchase more and more of their generics through McKesson.","You've heard me mention on a number of occasions how proud I am of the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Our team consistently finds new ways to improve the service and value we provide to all of our customers. A great example of how we connect with our customers is our annual conference, which brings together thousands of independent pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. The conference provides a forum for our customers to exchange best practices that can help them achieve better overall pharmacy health.","This year's event focused on helping our customers connect with their patients and other health care stakeholders in entirely new ways through clinical and medication adherence solutions, mobile technologies and enhanced marketing tools. The conference featured continuing education courses, public policy forums and live demonstrations designed to help independent pharmacy owners achieve better business health, better results for patients and create a better future for the community pharmacy.","A significant number of Health Mart pharmacy owners were in attendance and we were excited to debut a number of solutions designed to continue to differentiate and drive value for our members, including a new store design, an enhanced physician outreach program and a variety of medication adherence tools. Health Mart owners were able to view new local marketing solutions and mobile applications, both of which are designed to help attract more consumers into Health Mart pharmacies. With more than 3,100 pharmacies across the country, Health Mart has become the franchise model of choice for independent pharmacy owners looking to augment their local relationships with the backing of a strong national brand.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start it had to the fiscal year.","Moving now to our Specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter, and we expect nice revenue and profit growth in this business for the full year. We continue to expand the value we bring to our manufacturing and physician partners through our unique view of the business's specialty providers.","At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the value we bring to our physician and manufacturing partners in an evolving and complex environment. When we help our physician partners, regardless of the setting of care, not only do we have the strongest and most comprehensive offering to community cancer care through our U.S. Oncology Network, but often we continue to manage the outpatient cancer care when physicians affiliate with hospitals. I'm excited about the progress we continue to make in our Specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market.","Our Canadian business had a solid start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect strong growth in Canada for the full year, driven by new customers signed in the previous fiscal year and a recent customer transition.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. I am pleased with the results in our first full quarter as a combined organization with PSS. We are making strong progress on all of the objectives in our acquisition case, and perhaps most important, our people are excited and engaged about our opportunities to serve our customers going forward.","In fact, I just came back from the National Sales Meeting where I met with the newly combined 1,400-person Medical-Surgical sales force, and I have to say, their enthusiasm and spirit for the value we bring to our customers was truly impressive. This was an acquisition anchored in bringing together the best of 2 great organizations, and I'm delighted with the progress and the early results of the combined business and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.","Based on the strong performance in Distribution Solutions driven primarily by favorable generic performance in the first quarter, we now expect that adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. In summary, we're off to a terrific start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the year.","Technology Solutions had a strong first quarter result, with revenues up 9% and adjusted operating profit up 33%. Our adjusted operating margin improved 308 basis points to 17.02%. As you may recall, last quarter I talked about a number of actions we took in Technology Solutions and across the entire enterprise, frankly, to better position the company for fiscal 2014. And I'm encouraged by the early positive results we have seen thus far.","For the first quarter, we continued to make steady progress across all of our businesses within Technology Solutions. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth, McKesson Health Solutions and Enterprise and Medical Imaging businesses. Our first quarter results also benefited from achieving some important GA milestones in our Paragon solution. We remain pleased with the progress we continue to make in helping our Horizon customers transition to Paragon. Paragon continues to enjoy high ratings in terms of customer satisfaction and performance across a broad range of customers from the local community hospital setting to large hospital systems.","And finally, in our Physician Services and Software businesses, we turned in solid results for the first quarter, aided by our recent acquisition of Med3000. As a result of this solid performance and the removal of the operating results of our International Technology business and Hospital Automation businesses, which we are now reporting as part of discontinued operations, we now expect the adjusting -- adjusted operating margin for the Technology Solutions segment to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for the full year.","I want to make a few comments about how we are working hard to innovate for our Technology Solutions customers. When I speak to our technology customers, the level of change and complexity they face driven by evolving regulatory and economic realities is simply astonishing. They seek partners like McKesson who can offer a broad view of the changing environment and understand the convergence of the perspectives from hospitals and health systems, payers, providers, pharmacies and, of course, the patient, and they are eager for industry leaders to increasingly deliver solutions that will make the promise of a more connected health care system a reality.","We live in exciting times within the health care services and technology industry, and McKesson is well positioned to help our customers succeed.","We are proud to be a leader in our industry through our innovative partnerships, particularly the CommonWell Health Alliance. Just to remind everyone, CommonWell Health Alliance is a significant initiative with other leaders in the health care IT industry, who have a common vision and mission to allow patients and their caregivers access to information in a secure and private way anywhere care is offered. The initial goal of the alliance is to develop solutions for patient identity, consent and access management and a common approach to record storage and retrieval, regardless of the core system where the data resides. As you may have seen in a press release issued yesterday, additional leaders in our industry have joined CommonWell Alliance, including Computer Programs and Systems or CPSI and Sunquest Information Systems. They join the founding members of Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, Greenway Medical Technologies and McKesson and service provider RelayHealth in the Alliance's work.","We're off to a solid start to the year in Technology Solutions, and I'm pleased to see the progress we are making in our core businesses and the investments we are making for the future.","In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our improved outlook for the year. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $716 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged from our original guidance. I'm happy to report that our Board of Directors has authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting ongoing confidence in the cash flow strength of our business. And we are extremely well positioned to execute on our portfolio approach to capital deployment, to continue to deliver value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Erin, and I will return to address your questions when she finishes. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook.","McKesson reported strong first quarter results and has laid a good foundation for the remainder of fiscal 2014. I will begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional context as I walk through each of the segments in more detail.","Let me briefly mention one item that, while it did not impact our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results for the quarter. We continue to work through the remaining AWP cases. As a result of the progress made toward resolving these remaining claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $15 million. This charge was recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment and it equates to $0.04 per diluted share.","Before I move on, let me also remind you about one other item that impacts the presentation of our financial statements. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we took a number of strategic business realignment actions in our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter. As part of these actions, we are exiting our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses and the results of these businesses are now reported as discontinued operations.","My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.07, which excludes 4 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. I would remind you of our assumptions for the full year, which call for strong revenue growth in both segments. These assumptions still apply. On this 5% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 23% to $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions completed in both segments contributed to this result, with both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins and expansion.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% for the quarter, driven by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we continue to expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3% for fiscal 2014. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $6 million. Interest expense increased 5% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by new notes of $1.8 billion issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013.","For the full year, despite our higher levels of debt, we continue to expect our fiscal 2014 interest expense to be fairly flat versus the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 30.6% is in line with our full year estimate of 31% for the adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2014. I would remind you, however, that this adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $481 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.07.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 232 million. This year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases and our full year assumption of 231 million diluted weighted average shares for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged.","Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $31.4 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $23 billion, driven by market growth and our mix of business. For the full year fiscal 2014, we continue to anticipate direct revenue growth will rebound strongly from prior year levels, driven by the slowing of brand-to-generic conversions and aided by above-market growth from a handful of our largest customers.","Warehouse revenues declined 17% for the quarter, partially driven by a shift to Direct Store Delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate strong growth in this business as we expect to benefit from recent customer wins and a recent customer transition.","Medical-Surgical revenues were up 71% for the quarter to $1.4 billion, driven by the impact of the PSS acquisition.","Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 25% for the quarter on 5% revenue growth, resulting in a 78-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable generic performance. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 24% for the quarter, driven by the business acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013.","Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 223 basis points, an improvement of 38 basis points versus the prior year. As you've heard us say many times before, given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first quarter performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margins for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points.","Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were up 9% for the quarter to $805 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 9% for the quarter. And here again, you see the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $113 million, up 10% compared to $103 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 8% versus 7% a year ago. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit was up 33% to $137 million and our first quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 17.02%, an increase of 308 basis points versus the prior year.","Before I move on, let me remind you again that the results of our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses are reported as discontinued operations. And we now expect to be within the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for fiscal 2014. Said differently, our full year fiscal 2014 outlook for Technology Solutions' operational performance remains unchanged from what we discussed on our May 7 earnings call.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. So for receivables, our days sales outstanding remain unchanged at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days was flat versus a year ago, and our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 50 days. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $716 million for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operation will be approximately $2 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and we remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. In line with our capital deployment philosophy, as you saw in today's press release, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend. Internal capital spending was $100 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million.","Now, I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance on adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our original range of $7.90 to $8.20, to a new range of $8.05 to $8.35. In addition, we now expect $0.75 amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.22 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. And due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.04 for litigation reserve adjustments.","Now let me take a few moments to provide context for the LIFO-related adjustments that we expect in fiscal 2014. To give you a bit of history, McKesson elected to use the LIFO method of accounting for a majority of its inventory for accounting purposes more than 30 years ago under a tax conformity rule. While our actual LIFO adjustment is calculated at the end of our fiscal year, for interim reporting purposes, we will allocate that adjustment to the quarters. These quarterly estimates can vary significantly based on net product price trends, including brand-to-generic conversions and inventory levels. A LIFO charge is recognized during inflationary periods when the net effect of price increases on products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines.","So what does that mean for fiscal 2014? Taking a step back, if you think about the trends we've experienced over the past several years, for our fiscal years 2005 through 2011 our inventories were in a net price deflation period. This net price deflation was driven primarily by the large number of brand-to-generic conversions that occurred and the overall brand and generic pricing trends. During this time period, we also established a lower of cost or market, or LCM reserve, in order to properly value our inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or market. Then in fiscal 2012, we began to see these trends shift, particularly on brand and generic pricing, and our inventories experienced net price inflation. We continue to expect net inflation in our inventories in fiscal 2014 and are also now at a point where our LCM reserves are anticipated to be depleted in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","As a result, we will begin to record quarterly charges based on our estimate of the LIFO inventory charge for the full year. Sitting here today, we expect to record a total net LIFO-related charge between approximately $0.24 to $0.29 by the end of fiscal 2014.","As an aside, for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we did not record any LIFO-related charges. Consistent with how we discussed LIFO-related charges on our May 7 earnings call, and again at Investor Day in June, our fiscal 2014 guidance excludes the impact of all LIFO-related adjustments. Additionally, we have now updated our definition of non-GAAP measures to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We believe that excluding LIFO-related adjustments from our definition of adjusted earnings is a better reflection of the company's core operating performance, consistent with how we internally manage the business, and will provide useful information when comparing our past financial performance to our future financial results.","We will, of course, continue to provide all of the GAAP information we have historically provided as noted in Schedules 7 through 9.","In thinking about our fiscal 2014 guidance and beyond, it is important to note that regardless of what EPS measure is used, our ability to consistently grow our earnings over the long term remains unchanged.","Turning back now to the quarter. To summarize, McKesson delivered another outstanding financial performance, and our first quarter results position us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. The strength of our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives and we are optimistic about our fiscal 2014 outlook.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Lisa, I'll turn it back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, first question, just on the margins in the distribution space, clearly you beat the street by a lot. I was curious, how much did you beat your own internal budgets by, for the quarter itself, and what were the key drivers there?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we state our assumptions with you guys every year, annually, about our expectations for the year. And I think that most of the businesses performed in line with where we thought they were going to be. Clearly, U.S. pharma had a very strong quarter and a nice start to the year. And as we both mentioned, I think that performance was primarily driven by the performance of generics. It helped carry us above what we had expected originally and it helped us deliver a nice solid quarter.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And by that, you're talking about pricing, I guess, John?","John H. Hammergren","Well, it was really across the board. Clearly pricing played a role. But we also, I think, executed some very nice growth on our one-stop generics programs and we had some customers that were buying off of our portfolio in a more aggressive way than even we would've anticipated. So I think all in all, it was the overall generic offering that we have and benefited by some price inflation from our suppliers.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you offer an update on the CFO role?","John H. Hammergren","We're continuing to make good progress on our search for a replacement for our CFO. I have to once again thank Nigel Rees for the great work he's doing as Interim CFO. He's been a long-tenured executive, 12 years with us, and we have just a terrific financial organization. As you noticed, here, we've got Erin really stepping into Jeff's shoes as it relates to this conference call and the preparation for this call. And the depth of the financial organization is really showing as we go through this period of transition. I'm hopeful that we will make quick progress on the selection of a replacement, and we'll be able to move on with the kind of quality which you've expected from us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about, John, in the quarter, or Erin, what -- you talked about it being unusually strong, but how much of this was pull-forward from other quarters versus what we've seen historically? And what is your outlook around drug distribution as we move forward, just given what we've seen in this first quarter?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly it was a very strong start to the quarter and -- or for the quarter and the year, and we're really pleased with our results. You can see in that we've taken our guidance up for the year that we do believe that this outperformance in the quarter is not an entire pull-forward of future quarters. Having said all of that, there are 9 months left in this year and we have a significant dependence, as you know, on brand price inflation. And much of that, we anticipate, will come in the latter half of the year. So it's really too early to call success, but I think the ability for us to take the guidance up at least early in the year like we have this quarter is some indication of our view of the strength of the business.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, John, I guess, my follow-up question would be that in the past, we've talked about international expansion, and clearly, things are going pretty well in Canada, but you've exited Mexico. Can you just give us an updated thought on global purchasing and where McKesson stands on thoughts around getting into other areas of the world from a distribution perspective?","John H. Hammergren","Well, there's really 2 questions there. One is the question of Global Sourcing and our -- the scale and buying power and the ability for the team to execute. I think, once again, the strength of our performance in generics where most of the scale -- or I should say, the scale matters most, is evidenced by the fact that we continue to execute very well there. And it really is a combination of not only important scale but the ability to be adroit in terms of opportunities and take advantage of our relationships and to build value both for our customers and our suppliers. And we've been doing the Global Sourcing thing now for a long time and have built a significant amount of expertise in it. As it relates to distribution in other markets, clearly we have done a nice job in Canada. Our position there has continued to perform well over many years. And we show evidence of our ability to manage beyond the borders of the United States. Having said that, our disciplined approach to capital deployment remains and we've built a strong track record of doing smart things with our shareholders' money. And the first thing is that things have to make financial sense and strategic sense before we move forward and we have to be able to, obviously, feel we can execute against the opportunities that are in front of us. So we think scale is important, but executable scale and a simplicity to the approach, I think, is very important.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is on the IT side. Obviously, it looks that now with the new geographic concentration the fact that you've exited, discontinued some of the International Technology business is helping to improve the margin. So as we think just longer term, should we think of this as kind of like a new level of profitability for the IT segment?","John H. Hammergren","Erin. maybe you can take that one.","Erin Lampert","Sure. Well, Ricky, as we've tried to highlight on today's call, our operational assumptions for the Technology Solutions segment for the full year really remains unchanged. And what you see in the way that we've guided to our expectation to be at the upper end of our long-term margin range is a reflection of some of that change in mix that you see in the business.","John H. Hammergren","So just to further that, I think the -- clearly, the mix change we've experienced is an important aspect here. The business also performed very well in the first quarter, and we're pleased with the operational condition of the business, albeit it's early in the year. And then lastly, I think Erin provided pretty specific guidance related to -- that the expectation for the year is to be at the high end. So I think that the quarter's result, I wouldn't call it as a baseline, but we're clearly going to be well above where we were in prior years as a result of the transition out of these 2 businesses and the continued strength of the business. So I think we've taken it from low to mid-teens to a new range, and I think you should assume that that's the new baseline.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify, the $7.90 to $8.20 guidance, did that include the LIFO charge that you specified?","Erin Lampert","Thanks, Ricky. This is Erin. So, no, when we gave guidance back on May 7, we tried to be very clear and transparent that, that original guidance range did not, in fact, include assumptions related to LIFO. So what you see in terms of the comparison of the original range, and then, of course, our updated range is an apples-to-apples comparison.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I've been dialing back and forth here on a few different calls, but was there any update on the level of accretion that you expect in this fiscal year from the PSSI transaction?","John H. Hammergren","Steven, we did not provide an update, but I can provide an update. I think the level of accretion we expect this year is in line with what we said at the time we did the transaction in that $0.20 to $0.25 range. Clearly, we believe there are some long-term synergies that will be available to us as we get to the outer years of these integrations. But we do believe the business is performing at or above the expectations that we had coming into this. And I also mentioned how pleased I am with the energy level in the business and how well they're performing thus far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just touch on Medical. I know you mentioned that the integration sounds like it's going well with PSS, but I was wondering what you're seeing on the core medical business. On the acute care side, there's been some negative data points throughout earnings here. I was wondering if there was any spillover into the physician space or are you still seeing pretty healthy growth there?","John H. Hammergren","Well, as you know, we sold our acute care business, Robert, some time ago and so we don't have a lot of exposure to acute care or inpatient growth rates. We increasingly have a footprint in organizations that have acute care as part of their mix, these large IDNs that are buying physicians and we're doing extremely well in maintaining and growing our physician business as those acquisitions take place by these large hospital systems. We still see growth in our alternate site markets in that 5% plus or minus kind of range. Remember, we are very well positioned in both the physician market, as well as long-term care. And I'd say exceptionally well positioned also in our Homecare businesses. And so I think we're in the right part of the market from a Medical-Surgical perspective and those businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I understood the current footprint. I was just wondering, given some of the negative data points in the acute side, if you had seen any in the ambulatory side. It doesn't sound like you have. On the share shifts within the retail independents, since it's something that's come up a little bit, with us at least, have you guys noticed any significant market share changes amongst that client base?","John H. Hammergren","Well, these -- the market base is extremely diverse, so you don't see a lot of trends in these businesses very easily because it takes a long time for independent customers to make enough -- enough of them to make any decisions one way or the other to affect sort of the underlying share statistics. Having said all of that, we continue to evolve our programs and focus on adding a significant amount of value to our existing relationships and to provide a platform that really is attractive to our customers where they know they can have a long-term partner that's focused to work alongside them to improve their performance on many different dimensions, not just the cost of distribution but the profitability of their stores. So I think we're very well positioned to continue to grow nicely in the independent space, and obviously, a lot of that is just continuing to earn the privilege of serving our customers in a broader context.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, I apologize, but I need to ask one more question on the margins and distribution. When you guys hosted your Analyst Day last month, I think you talked about the manufacture economics on both branded and generics were better than what you thought. And you thought it was a little bit premature at that point to determine if it was just a timing shift or really a trend change in terms of what's going on with the manufacturers. Maybe you could give us a little bit more details as to what you're seeing at the manufacturer level that's maybe translating into such decent margins for you guys?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think the branded portion of our profit has remained relatively in line with where we expected it to be, slightly -- maybe slightly ahead. But clearly, we've a lot of year left as it relates to those branded relationships and how we're paid in this. I might remind those of you that are sort of new to this, those relationships are kind of predetermined and so the issue is really around the timing associated with those value-creating events of prices with branded manufacturers. On the generics side, we did have very strong performance in our portfolio in the quarter. And to your point, I think it's a little bit premature to call any of the things that we saw from an upside perspective on -- as a trend change. Clearly, our business operations, I think, you can count on continuing to be there and then hopefully we'll continue to have momentum in the way we execute on our generic opportunities. However, on the brand side, we are a little dependent on how those -- excuse me, on the price side, we're a little bit dependent on how those generic manufacturers behave over time, and I think it's really too early to make an industry call relative to trends.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. If I -- maybe if I could just follow up on your Specialty business. It seems to be that everything is going well there from both the revenue and margin perspective. Obviously, one of your competitors has called out some issues in that business, and I understand the businesses are not apples-to-apples to be compared. But if you think about some of the things going on there, whether it be a little bit more restrictive labeling or transition of the point of care or sequestration having an impact on the community, oncologists, I mean, I'm just surprised that you're not seeing any of that impact to your business or maybe you are?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly we see the same stresses on our customer base as exhibited in the entire industry. We are very concerned about the reimbursement pressure that our oncologists are facing and, clearly, we are heavily engaged to make sure that we speak on their behalf and on our behalf to make sure that the reimbursement that goes on in that marketplace stays where it needs to stay and that they're adequately paid for the services they provide. We believe community oncology still provides the lowest cost and best quality alternative in the marketplace. As to our business, I can't really speak for the whole industry. Clearly, the minor variations that may exist relative to reimbursement are really covered in the guidance range that we provided. So we don't think that we will experience something driven by reimbursement alone that will cause us to fall outside of the guidance that we've provided, and so relatively nominal effects, as it relates to what we're trying to do overall. And last I would say that our business model is quite different than our competitors in this marketplace. And you'll notice a pattern here in all of our discussions in our attempt to add value to our relationships in a way that's difficult to price-compete against. And when we're thinking about the total value we can deliver to oncologists in this country, it really is unmatched in that we can help them on almost every dimension of their practice. Including expanding into radiology and other types of service offerings, clearly helping them with getting on the contracts with the payors, helping to become more productive and efficient. All of those things really allow us to have a conversation with a customers that's in significant stress about how they might partner with McKesson to improve their performance. So I do think the market trend may be slightly stressed as a result of reimbursement changes. Clearly, our customers are feeling it. But if we do this properly, McKesson will provide a great vehicle to help them out of the challenge that they face and that we face together.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick one for Erin. Is this the D&A run rate that we should see for the rest of the year? And then maybe for John, just a bit more direct. I can't believe the ongoing debate on Celesio that we're seeing in the media. Is that good for your stock? Is there anything that you could say more directly to that business model, why it might fit, why it would not fit your model?","John H. Hammergren","Well, let me take the Celesio part of that question, then Erin can address the first part of your question. I think that you never know what goes on in the media, particularly in Europe. I'm not that familiar with how these bankers get engaged, and what they might say or might not say and why they would say them or not say them. We've seen noise in these markets before and speculation before, and you just don't know what the motives might be and what's real and what's not real. Clearly, the concern as a shareholder at McKesson, people should have is does that company have the proper scale to compete, do we have the proven track record to use that scale in a way that gives us the best value of delivery to our customers and to the manufacturers we partner with and are we doing it in a way that is intelligent use of the capital that's been entrusted to us by our shareholders? So I think that international expansion clearly can provide scale on some dimensions. The question is it scale that's actionable, can you do something with that buying power? Is it really truly in the control of the distributor and what capital do you have to deploy to do it, and what is it -- how does it translate into a synergy that's worth buying when you add additional complexity. So what you should take away from this, frankly, is we're not closed to any ideas. Our job is to evaluate ideas, including M&A ideas, in a very aggressive and intelligent way. At the same time, you should take away from this, we're not going to be chasing something that somebody else has done or thinks is a good idea, or chasing investment bankers and media on opportunities that we have not clearly determined are in our best interest. So I would dismiss what's in the media just from a standpoint of you just never know where it's headed and why.","Erin Lampert","And, Bob, to address your question on D&A, on the materials that we provided today. Obviously, we've provided updated assumptions on amortization based on the acquisitions that are closed at this time. And I also provided some update, or actually talked about our full year capital spending, which is in line with our original expectations. So I think on the depreciation side, what you see our first quarter run rate is a reasonable approximation of the full year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","John, you mentioned some progress in the IT business on the GA front, maybe elaborate a bit there. And in general, it seems like a pretty stable environment on the software side but you continue to do well in most of the transaction businesses. Obviously, you're much happier with the performance there. Do you feel like getting rid some of those underperforming pieces will help remove some of the distraction there as well?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, I think the business is able to focus more in the new portfolio and the way the portfolio has been organized. And clearly, the financial condition of the business is -- and its improvement is more apparent as it relates to what we reported in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress at Paragon with the general availability of several of their new modules and that did allow us to, frankly, recognize some revenue that may be slightly pulled forward from the rest of the year's expectation. But I think that we're really -- we're pleased with the progress. And probably as important, as you know, Paragon had commitments to customers related to future delivery and in many ways, evidence of the ability to us -- for us to develop our way to a complete offering that can compete in the marketplace. And this is additional evidence of the development teams' expertise at Paragon and our ability to hit those requirements. So I am pleased with the condition of the business.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe just quickly on Canada. We saw some consolidation up there in terms of 2 of the dispensers. I mean, if that's a trend that continues, I mean, what's your thought about what that means for your business and positioning up there?","John H. Hammergren","We have a very strong long-term relationship with one of the consolidators that was talked about in the quarter, and that's Loblaws. We are the distributor partner for them. And so watching our partners grow is a positive thing for us. Consolidation carries an opportunity and also carries a threat. The threat is that you've got to continue to be refined in your approach and cost effective and add tremendous value as your customers get more and more scale. But on the other hand, it also provides an opportunity for us to bring expertise in a wider-ranging array of abilities across a stronger, or bigger footprint that our customers may be accumulating or amassing. So I think we've done well in worlds that are consolidating in both the U.S. and Canada.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you just comment, please, on your hospital IT customers' conversion process from Horizon over to Paragon? Our data is coming back pretty positive in terms of your retention of those Horizon clients. I mean, I imagine these Paragon GA items have -- are associated with that?","John H. Hammergren","Thank you for the question. Yes, our data would also indicate that our transition of Horizon customers to Paragon is ahead of the expectations that we had. And the customers that have made these early decisions to make that transition I think have done so with a view that Paragon is the platform of choice, both in terms of its features and function, but also in its total cost of ownership. And as you point out, the further development of the product line and the GAs that we've announced helped solidify the customer's view that this is the product of choice going forward. So we are pleased with the progress. That's not to say that we don't have more work to do and that there aren't existing Horizon customers that are still asking themselves the question of whether or not they should invest in somebody else's platform or if they should take advantage of this unique opportunity to convert to Paragon. So we're hopeful that we will continue to make that progress.","I want to thank you, operator, and I want to also thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm extremely pleased with our strong first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And I also want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contribution to these great results. And I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event. On November 12, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings in late October. Thank you for your attention today and goodbye.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"14192":["McKesson (NYSE:MCK) Q1 2015 Earnings Call July 31, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Erin Lampert - ","John H.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.","And now, your host for today's call, Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Lampert, please go ahead, ma'am.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Rufus. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.","We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks. And here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a strong start to fiscal 2015 with total company revenues of $44.1 billion with adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.49. Based on the strength of our Distribution Solutions results in the first quarter and our confidence in the full year, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015.","Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on 2 items. First, I'm pleased with the outcome of the Celesio Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which was held on July 15 in Stuttgart, Germany. As part of the standard German legal process, at that meeting, shareholders voted to approve the domination agreement between McKesson and Celesio.","The domination agreement must be registered with the German courts in order to become effective. Before that registration can take place, minority shareholders may assert challenges, which may be based on substance or technical grounds. Anticipate that at least 1 challenge will be filed. Under German law, there is a limited period of time for such disputes to be heard. Based on our current assessment, we now expect that the domination agreement will be registered with the German courts and therefore, McKesson will be allowed to exercise operating control over Celesio at the end of the current calendar year. This time line represents a modest delay from our previous expectation that we would achieve operating control late in the first half of fiscal 2015.","The second item I want to highlight is related to the sale of our International Technology business. Approximately 1 year ago, we talked about a number of actions to better position the company going forward, including our intention to sell our International Technology business. This business consisted of 2 main divisions: clinical and financial solutions, and workforce solutions.","In July, we completed the sale of the clinical and financial systems portion of McKesson International Technology's business -- our McKesson International Technology business. The workforce solution division, which provides workforce and payroll solutions to the U.K. National Health Service, was not included as part of the sale.","As a result, it was determined that this business would need to be reclassified from discontinued operations, where we reported the results in fiscal 2014, back into continuing operations for fiscal 2015. As part of the reclassification of this business, from discontinued operations to continuing operations, we recognized a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per diluted share in our first quarter adjusted earnings results.","It's important to note that our sole contract in the U.K.-based workforce solutions business with the NHS expires in late calendar 2015. We do not intend to rebid this contract going forward. And therefore, we'll continue to operate the business only to the end of the existing contract.","Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a strong start to the year with revenue of $43.3 billion in the quarter, up 38%, adjusted operating profit of $1 billion, up 44%, and both are reported on constant currency basis.","","North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the quarter aided by higher-than-expected revenue growth. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as well as solid growth across our independent national retail and mail order customers. Based on this revenue strength in the first quarter, we are now -- we now believe revenue growth in North America will be modestly ahead of our original expectations for the year.","Within our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we also experienced solid growth across our portfolio of generic and brand pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. It is important to note, however, our full year expectations for both brand and generic inflation remained unchanged.","We continue to make solid progress in executing our new agreement with Rite Aid. And as you saw in our recent press release, I am delighted with the extension of our long-standing distribution relationship with CVS Caremark through June of 2019. As you know, we have a tremendous track record of delivering comprehensive supply chain solutions to CVS. We are proud to continue this valued relationship.","Last week, we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. This year's conference helped attendees understand the transformation in the market driven by an emphasis on patient -- positive patient outcomes, continued growth of preferred networks and a focus on the pharmacy's ability to impact important quality and patient satisfaction ratings.","Our conference attracts a significant number of our Health Mart customers and we are extremely proud to have reached a milestone of more than 3,400 Health Mart pharmacy members. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start to this fiscal year.","Moving now to our specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter with nice growth across the business. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the diversity of our specialty portfolio, where we are a leading service and technology provider across multiple specialty areas.","It is this diversity of our broad portfolio that sets us apart. In particular, our model through U.S. Oncology provides comprehensive services across the spectrum of the cancer care. We're excited about the progress we continue to make in our specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. And our Canadian business had a solid start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 3% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we continue to move through the required steps to achieve operating control of the company. We now expect to achieve this milestone by the end of our current calendar year.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 2% over the prior year. We're off to a solid start to the year in our Medical-Surgical business and we continue to make good progress optimizing our distribution network and technology platforms related to the acquisition of PSS World Medical.","In summary, we are off to a strong start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.","Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% for the first quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinical software platform and the disposition of our product line as we discussed on our last earnings call. Adjusted operating margins in this segment were 10.4%, which includes the $34 million pretax charge associated with the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business from discontinued operations to continuing operations. Excluding this charge, adjusted operating margins for this segment would have been 15%.","More broadly, we continued to made steady progress across our Technology Solutions businesses. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth Connectivity business, along with positive results in our physician services and medical imaging businesses.","I also want to highlight the recent success of the CommonWell Health Alliance. Over a year ago, McKesson collaborated with several other organizations to demonstrate our leadership in finding solutions to address the issue of data interoperability in our industry. These companies recognized early on that pervasive connectivity cannot be accomplished by any one vendor. It must be implemented in a way that all vendors and systems can effectively participate.","The CommonWell Health Alliance began with 5 founding members, all with a common goal, to change the standards of interoperability for the nation. And today, the alliance has grown to include a total of 11 members. Recently, the CommonWell members were able to demonstrate success through the launch of foundational services across 4 geographies, and in select pilot locations. The goal of the pilots was to validate the proof of concept and understand from the providers the ways in which we can continue to bring added value. We have been encouraged by the success of the pilots. And now CommonWell members, including McKesson, are gearing up for expansion and commercialization of the program with the foundational services provided by RelayHealth and a plan to continue to add members to the alliance. We are very pleased with the success to date and are looking forward, along with our partners, to the next growth phase for CommonWell.","In summary, we continue to make solid progress in our key strategic priorities for McKesson Technology Solutions, including helping our customers reduce cost, operate more efficiently, providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics and supporting our customers' transformation to a world of value-based care.","Now to wrap up my comments for our fiscal first quarter. The strength of our operating performance is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter, which, I'll remind you, include the charge of $0.11 per diluted share as a result of the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business to continuing operations. This was not contemplated in our original plan.","In light of the strong operating performance, we are pleased with our improved outlook for the full year. And as I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we are raising our guidance by a range of $0.10, to $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015.","In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. In the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $182 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment to continue to deliver value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James. And we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a strong start to fiscal 2015. And as John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90.","Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our acquisition of Celesio. Before I move on, let me remind you that in this quarter, both GAAP and adjusted earnings reflect the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business, referred to as our workforce business, from discontinued operations back to continuing operations.","Releases to the workforce business reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share, largely representing a onetime catch-up of depreciation and amortization on the underlying assets as we move the business from discontinued to continuing operations.","It is also important to note that fiscal '14 was recast to include the results of the workforce business. Schedule 9 provides a recast fiscal '14 consolidated and technology segment revenues.","Revenues for the workforce business were $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal '14 and $147 million for the full year. Fiscal '14, as recast for the addition of the workforce business, includes $0.04 and $0.21 in contribution to adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter and full year, respectively, as outlined on Schedules 7 and 8.","Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.49, which excludes 3 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 37% for the quarter to $44.1 billion. On this 37% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 50% to $2.9 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 64% for the quarter, mainly driven by Celesio. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter. Other income was $21 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased 71% versus the prior year to $101 million, driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio.","Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted income for the quarter was $585 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.49. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million.","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues increased for the quarter to $43.3 billion, up 38% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $34.3 billion, primarily reflecting market growth, including sales of 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, the delay of certain generic launches to later in the fiscal year and growth in our Canadian and specialty businesses.","In addition, as John mentioned, in this quarter, we recorded solid growth across our portfolio of generic and branded pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%. Based on the growth we have seen, primarily from the sales of 2 hepatitis C drugs, we now expect that North America will be modestly ahead of our previous full year expectations of mid-single-digit revenue growth.","International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.6 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 68% for the quarter on 38% revenue growth, resulting in 106 basis points improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin.","In addition to the Celesio acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our pharmaceutical portfolio, including earlier-than-expected generic and brand price increases that occurred late in the quarter.","Our full year assumption for generic and brand price inflation remains unchanged. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 90% for the quarter, driven by our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 232 basis points, an improvement of 9 basis points versus the prior year.","As I mentioned earlier, we now expect revenue growth for our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business to be modestly ahead of expectations. Based on the anticipated mix of revenue in our North American business, we now expect operating margins to increase mid-single-digit basis points year-over-year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $768 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, offset by growth in our other technology businesses. It is important to note that relative to fiscal '14's recast revenues, the workforce business revenues are expected to be down year-over-year. And as a result, we now expect segment revenues for the full year to decline by low single-digits year-over-year.","As I discussed earlier, first quarter GAAP and adjusted results for Technology Solutions reflect a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share. $32 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $2 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 4%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. First quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 45% to $80 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was 10.42%, representing a decrease of 692 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the workforce business charge, the adjusted operating margin rate was 15%. Based on the reclassification of the workforce business, we now expect the full year adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the mid-teens level.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, this quarter's working capital metrics also include Celesio.","For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 31 days. Our days sales in payables were flat year-over-year at 50 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 2 days to 52 days.","We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $119 million for the quarter.","Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share from our original range of $10.40 to $10.80 to a new range of $10.50 to $10.90. In addition, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.50 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.95 and $1.05 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.","Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some important aspects of the next steps in our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned earlier, we now expect to secure operating control by the end of the calendar year. We continue to believe we can achieve the previously stated accretion range of $1 to $1.20 on an adjusted earnings basis during the 12-month period beginning February 2014. You will recall, however, that this range assumes 100% ownership. Our current ownership stake in Celesio remains at 76%. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million.","In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first quarter and we are well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Rufus?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, James, maybe I'll just ask a couple of questions about the guidance for back half of the year. Net of the IT charge, is it right to think about that you guys are actually kind of taking the guidance up by $0.20 considering the $0.11 -- or call it $0.21, given the IT charge kind of taken in the quarter?","James A. Beer","Well, certainly, obviously, we do include that IOG charge, workforce business charge, in our adjusted earnings. So absent that, yes, we are upping the formal guide by $0.10. But in the first quarter, yes, you're right. We did absorb an $0.11 charge associated with that workforce business.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I wanted to make sure I understood that quickly. And then maybe just a quick follow-up either for James or John. Generic drug price inflation has obviously been very strong in helping the performance of the IT business. I guess, can you talk about expectations for the back half of the year, given the strength that you saw in the front half of the year?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we did think -- we do think there was some pull-forward, George, of our generic price inflation models for the full fiscal year, but we really don't change -- we haven't changed our outlook if you think about it on a full year basis. So I think right now it's early for our fiscal year, but we believe that the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year is still reasonable.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if maybe if we look at the overall drug distribution revenue, and then, John, I think you talked about the Hep C drug. But if you back out Hep C in the quarter, can you maybe give us an idea of what you're seeing for underlying utilization and any early signs of ACA? We see Rite Aid just reported this morning again strong results on the pharma side. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing in your model.","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's difficult to account for what the Affordable Care Act effect is in our business. We came into the year believing there would be some modest effect from it and we still believe that's the case. We really had strength across the entire segment of Rx revenues, Canada and Specialty, in particular, came in very strong for us. So I think we're pleased with the momentum that we have. And as you mentioned, the Hep C drugs were also a surprise to us, of how quickly they've been taken up, and the volumes that we received there. So I think, overall, we're pleased with the performance of the revenues in that business.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, John, just as a follow up, you mentioned the extension of your relationship with CVS. Are there any changes of note to that new relationship that goes through 2019?","John H. Hammergren","It's basically the same form that we've had with them in the past in terms of the service and the relationship. So we're pleased to have renewed it, and we think it continues to show the quality of the service and the relationships we have with our customers.","Operator","And we go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions here. First of all, I think, I heard the comment on the operating margin now expected to grow at mid-single due to mix. So can you guys just give us some more color on the underlying kind of like revenue mix and kind of like what you've seen that was different in your expectations?","James A. Beer","Yes, the driver of my comments around the Distribution Solutions' operating margin is really the impact of the Hep C drugs that we saw really having a very strong rollout in this last quarter, and that is what's driving the margin effect.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of like a quick follow-up. On kind of like just the Rite Aid generic contract, I know -- I think you said that you expect to see the benefits flowing through in the September quarter, so is this still kind of like -- is timing still consistent with your earlier expectations?","John H. Hammergren","We're really pleased with the continued performance in our relationship with Rite Aid. I would say that our contract negotiations are -- have progressed the way we had anticipated. The conversation around September was probably more focused on our delivery of generics to their individual stores. So we are probably better than halfway through the implementation of store delivery of generics directed by McKesson, and that will continue to evolve until we have 100% of that responsibility as we get to the fall time frame.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of contribution to your bottom line, should we see that in the following quarter?","John H. Hammergren","I think you -- our guidance anticipates the effect of Rite Aid's business flowing through McKesson. And so I -- other than the dilutive effect, it has been a bit of a surprise from Hep C from a margin rate perspective. The rest of the performance of the business is right in line with our expectations.","Operator","We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, I just want to talk to you about the North American Distribution business. The company continues to post very solid results in that segment and if I hear you correctly, obviously, specialty sort of helped the revenue line maybe volumes also helped the revenue line. But if I filter that down to the operating profit line, we're still seeing very sizable beats. And I'm wondering if you could help us sort of think through what might really be driving that better-than-expected result. Is it the branded and generic price inflation being pulled forward? Is it the volumes? Or -- we're not really sure what the margins look like on the specialty drugs you're talking about. So any sort of help in triangulating what's really driving that operating profit would be helpful.","John H. Hammergren","I think it comes from many of the sources that you just highlighted. Clearly, the brand and generic performance in the quarter was very strong. We're pleased with the revenue growth we received, in particular, out of Canada and in Specialty. But even our standard Rx business has been supported by robust growth really across-the-board. And the continued uptake of our generic portfolio, the strength of Northstar, our ability to continue to bring market share to our customer base and the strength of OneStop, our generic program in our markets, continues to remain very strong. So I really feel like the businesses in North American pharmaceuticals are performing very well.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe I'll just follow-up on Celesio. Obviously, they're out with operating results this morning and kind of looking through those results, it seems like maybe some of the segments might have performed a little bit better while some of the other segments continue to be -- face some challenges that I think you've talked about in the past. But maybe could you give us some high-level commentary about maybe what you thought of the results? And is everything kind of performing relative to where you would have expected?","John H. Hammergren","Yes, I think so. Overall, we're basically in line with our expectations. As you noted, in their comments, they've talked a little bit about where their strength is coming and where some of their weaknesses are. And I think that their commentary is generally in line with what we expected.","Operator","Our next question, we go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to go back to guidance, a couple of moving pieces here relative to the previous communication. Am I correct to assume that there was some slight synergies assumed previously from the timing of operational control of Celesio and would that now not be included in the new guidance range given the pushout of the expectation on operational control? And then on the International Technology business, I understand that you're absorbing the $0.11 charge. But as we think about the balance of the year, are there corresponding earnings from that business that come back into the P&L?","James A. Beer","Yes, so on the first of your questions, what we've spoken about in the past was that we expected just a modest amount of synergies from Celesio during fiscal '15. So yes, at some level, the pushout of operational control by a few months does have some impact on that. But again, they were modest expectations in the first place, I just want to emphasize that. And in terms of the workforce business and the impact later in the year, I would expect that, that would continue year-over-year because again, we've recast history. So we have all of that in the schedules to the press release. I would expect that, that would continue to create something of a headwind year-over-year for the balance of the fiscal '15.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, John, I guess just on the cash deployment, I understand you got probably about 1.5 on hold for Celesio and there's some debt redemptions over the next 18 months. But still a lot of cash with over $4 billion on the balance sheet today, solid cash flow again. Anything you can give us around how we should think about that cash being returned to shareholders or any perspectives on the M&A landscape at this point?","John H. Hammergren","Well, as you point out, there are a couple of uses of the cash that we already have sort of planned into our future. One is the purchase of the remaining outstanding shares of Celesio. We still have 24% left to accumulate, which we believe will happen over time, as well as the debt repayment that we've committed to accomplish as we go forward. We want to remain investment-grade, as we've indicated. And that, as a backdrop, will probably cause us to continue to have a portfolio approach to our capital deployment. But it doesn't mean that we won't return to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchase, some of that cash. But what it does mean is that our priority is to make sure we maintain investment grade and that we avail ourselves of opportunities from an M&A perspective that make sense, which we've done on a regular basis.","Operator","And we go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So a couple of quick ones here. First the 2% revenue growth in the Med-Surg distribution segment, is that an indicative of a normalized run rate that we should expect maybe for the rest of the year?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think that we believe the Med-Surg business is growing in line with our original expectations. So we think mid-single-digits is probably where we're going to be. So it's a little softer in the quarter than we would have -- we would forecast for the full year. And I think the softness is really in line with what we believe the market performed at for the first [indiscernible] for us. And I have to emphasize that we're really pleased with the continued progress of Med-Surg. From an integration perspective, we are really accomplishing our objectives there, and the team is doing a good job.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, you guys had that previous commentary about the percent of earnings in the first half of '15 being similar to fiscal '11 through '13 and I know that was kind of loose sort of guidance or commentary previously. But is that still relevant with these 1Q results or does that sort of go out the window with the strength of 1Q?","James A. Beer","Well, I think what I'd say is I'd stick to the annual guide that we've offered. I think given the quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results, it's hard to give directional assistance to you just for a single quarter. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. We saw some price increases both on the branded side and on the generic side move up into this quarter earlier than we had planned. And then also, we saw some of the brand-to-generic conversions that we were expecting pushed further back towards the end of fiscal '15. So I think I'd really just align you to the overall annual guide.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it's now been a pretty remarkable period for the company. I mean you obviously had the Celesio acquisition, the Rite Aid agreement. It sort of shows the value you can provide to some of your larger customers. How has that sort of begat discussions with other customers you have in terms of the McKesson value proposition and how you can obviously then prove that you can obviously provide more value to kind of the broader universe as well?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we think our early success with the implementation of the Rite Aid relationship as well as our continued performance in these businesses is an indication of our customers' reliance on our ability to work in partnership with them to deliver superior results. And I think we continue to work with those customers that have not fully availed themselves of the offerings that we have to make sure that they understand the kind of results we think we can obtain together and to help them quantify, not only the savings from sourcing with us, but also the savings associated with having us manage the logistics requirements associated with the purchase of product as well. And there's still significant customers that are somewhat redundant with us related to those deliveries that we think afford both of us opportunities. Having said that, these are big strategic decisions that have to be made and it'll take some time for some customers, I think, to reach the same conclusion that others have already reached. But I think our performance, as the first quarter shows, is an indication of customers' continued reliance on our ability to help them on many dimensions, including sourcing of products.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, John. And maybe just on Technology Solutions I mean, this has been a bumpy ride now for quite a while and I know you've done a lot to sort of scale-down some of the clinical pieces where you've struggled. But as you think about the investment in this space and you think about the footprint, I mean -- so what is, at the board level and at the management level, what is the debate on sort of longer-term aspirations and goals for certain businesses? And then how do you -- how did you figure out what needed to go versus what needed to stay and how does that sort of affect how you're going to continue to look at the portfolio, I guess, going forward?","John H. Hammergren","Well, if you set aside the surprise we had, so to speak, going into this quarter, which was the lack of our ability to exit the portion of the international operations business that we had related to the workforce and to run that contract out as opposed to selling it, if you set that aside and you actually look at the performance of the business, it's basically in line with our expectation. And what we've been focused on there is making sure that we have the appropriate operating margin for businesses of this type. That we're growing the earnings of the business in a way that's responsible and reflects the opportunity that we see in front of us. That the growth coming from the positive businesses in that segment are able to offset the drag associated with businesses that are not growing, as we know that they won't in certain categories there. In particular, the Horizon Clinical business that we're in the process of winding our way out of. And I would say that the last dimension that's important to us is these businesses are significant cash producers for us and I think the management team knows how to operate them. So the bumpiness on occasion is caused by things like IOG that we didn't fully expect to roll back into operations, and we'll work our way through that as well. I think at the portfolio level, we have a responsibility to look at this business as well as all of our businesses, not so much in the aggregate in the way that we report them, perhaps. But if you disaggregate them, there are a lot of the smaller businesses and product lines that make up these 2 large segments -- or 3 large segments now. And I think what we're focused on is how do we make sure that we've got the right portfolio of products and services in those segments to grow the business.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Guys, I apologize if I missed this. But for the quarter, James, just thinking about the 14% North America pharmaceutical distribution business, what do you believe was the contribution from the Hep C launches for the quarter, just in terms of contribution to growth rate?","James A. Beer","Well, you've seen Gilead announce their results, and I'd just say that directionally, our revenues coming out of Sovaldi, for example, would have been in line with the overall market share across the 3 big distributors in this country.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then just lastly, on the same topic, as it relates to kind of the margin dilution, if you will, year-on-year from the launch of the Hep C drugs, any noticeable impact just in terms of stomping margin expansion for the distribution solutions segment?","James A. Beer","Well, the guidance that I offered a little earlier, mathematically it represents a very modest reduction in margins for Distribution Solutions. And obviously, those have been going up consistently in recent years. And at Analyst Day, you'll recall that we reset the long-term margin goal for Distribution Solutions up to between 250 and 300 basis points. So modest impact from these Hep C drugs in the short term.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sorry to keep beating this horse, but one of your competitors mentioned that generic inflation was higher this year than they thought versus expectations of being lower. You talked about it just being more price pull-throughs earlier than expected, how do you -- how do we square those 2 comments? Has inflation, in fact, been higher than you expected or is it really just timing?","John H. Hammergren","I can't really comment on other's -- other people's comments. But what I would say is that I would reflect on the fact that we all have different fiscal years. We all have different portfolios of generics. We have different proprietary programs in the generic world. We have different relationships with generic manufacturers. And having said all of that, our point of view on generic price inflation for our fiscal year remains unchanged from the guidance we gave you at the beginning of our fiscal year. The only thing that we really tried to clarify in this call was that we believe some of that inflation was pulled forward in the first quarter, but our full year remains sort of intact with our previous view. So I know that it's a complex, complex discussion to have. Just also makes it even more complex when we're trying to forecast the behavior of others in the channel where we don't have complete visibility. So it's -- frustrating, as it may be to you sometimes, we can't tell you what our goal for generic inflection will be for 12 months out. But frankly, it's a little bit of a black box for us as well, and have to make educated and informed estimates as to what we think will happen. And sometimes, those estimates are off either from a timing perspective or from a magnitude perspective. And what we're saying here is that really we're seeing some timing differences. But the magnitude, we think, will remain relatively the same.","James A. Beer","Yes. And that magnitude that we talked about when we offered the guide for fiscal '15 was high single-digit growth year-over-year.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore, Mr. Hammergren, I will turn the conference back over to, sir.","John H. Hammergren","Thank you, Rufus, and thanks to all of you on the call and for providing some time today to listen to our results. I'm pleased with our strong first quarter performance. We're certainly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contributions to these great results. Now I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 9, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. On September 30, we will present at the Leerink Partners Healthcare Services Roundtable in New York. And on November 11, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings results in late October.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and LIFO-related adjustments.

Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thanks. And here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren","Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid results for our second quarter with total company revenues of $44.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.79.","We've seen strong execution across all of our businesses, and I'm pleased with the great performance of our team in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015.","Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on our acquisition of Celesio. Currently -- excuse me, approximately, 1 year ago, we announced our intention to acquire Celesio, the former global leader in health care services, by bringing together the strengths and expertise of 2 companies with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and common histories as trusted partners to our customers.","The next important milestone in bringing together our 2 companies is the registration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with a relevant German court, which we continue to expect by the end of calendar 2014. The registration of this agreement will effectively allow McKesson and Celesio to begin our cooperative work to develop and deliver the synergy case we have outlined, where we expect to achieve 277 -- $275 million to $325 million in annual synergies by the fourth year following the registration of the domination agreement.","We remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us to continue to lead in an increasingly global pharmaceutical supply chain and to enhance our customer's ability to deliver better and more efficient health care services.","Moving now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had strong results in the second quarter with revenues of $44 billion, up 37%, and adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion, up 29% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Based on the strong revenue trends we have seen year-to-date, we now believe full year revenue growth in North America will be in the low double digits, driven primarily by strong demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C and the timing of certain generic launches, which will come later than we had originally planned.","We also now expect adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment to be flat to modestly up year-over-year, driven primarily by our expectation they will have a much stronger mix of branded pharmaceutical business in fiscal 2015 compared to our original plan, specifically driven by the higher-than-anticipated revenue from hepatitis C drugs and the delay in certain generic launches.","Our updated full year outlook for Distribution Solutions operating margin also includes an assumption that margin in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will come down modestly from the prior year.","North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the second quarter. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the second quarter, driven by the continued strength and demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C as well as solid growth across our hospital, national retail and independent customers.","Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to innovate and expand the boundaries of operational excellence in everything we do for our customers and our manufacturing partners. We perform an essential and valued service for our branded manufacturing partners and continue to earn steady levels of compensation in return. We also benefit from the growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offerings.","We continue to see strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program as a growing number of our customers benefit from the strength and scale of McKesson's sourcing expertise.","An important addition to our OneStop program in the first half of the fiscal year has been the volume associated with Rite Aid. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the operational transition associated with the implementation of our expanded agreement with Rite Aid, which we first announced back in February. I want to recognize the outstanding efforts of our U.S. Pharmaceutical team and the team at Rite Aid for successfully completing the transition, with a clear focus on ensuring great service through Rite Aid stores.","McKesson's direct-to-store deliveries to all of Rite Aid's more than 4,500 stores helps to ensure operational efficiencies, excellent service levels and improved product availability for Rite Aid's customers. Our expanded agreement with Rite Aid is delivering the savings envisioned by both organizations by driving additional efficiencies in the distribution and sourcing of pharmaceutical products and the significant savings associated with improved working capital utilization.","Our team does an outstanding job day-in and day-out by aligning our interests with our customers' interests, and we know that their success is our success. The strength, skill and scale of McKesson's global procurement team ensures we are providing our customers with the results that are better than they would have achieved on their own, with the highest levels of product quality and availability. By working together with our customers, we are able to truly create a winning formula that delivers savings and efficiencies in the delivery of pharmaceutical products.","In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the second quarter and the outstanding results we have delivered in the first half of the fiscal year.","Turning now to our Specialty business. We had another quarter of solid results and we continue to see strong growth across the business. I'm pleased with the growth in our oncology business, where we are focused on delivering the highest-quality cancer care in a payment model that rewards value. And we continue to see growth in our other specialties, such as ophthalmology and rheumatology, where we believe we can leverage our distribution and sourcing expertise along with our technology assets to help ensure specialist physicians continue to grow their practices and deliver high-quality care to their patients.","And our Canadian business had another solid quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. We continue to grow our Canadian business through our focus on operational excellence, ensuring we have an optimized and efficient distribution infrastructure in place, investing in important and growing markets, such as Specialty Services and Distribution, and growing our presence in private label generics in the Canadian market.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the second quarter were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen in Celesio's results announced this morning, we continue to expect revenue to increase modestly year-over-year on the underlying results of Celesio and now expect a modest decline in operating profit year-over-year, driven by market pressure in Germany, France and Brazil, partially offset by continued strong performance in our U.K. businesses.","Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our Medical-Surgical team continues to do an excellent job with the integration of PSS, bringing together and optimizing the sales, distribution and information systems platforms within the business.","Integration and our pursuit of synergies from the acquisition remain on schedule and in line with our expectations. Critical to our success to date has been the significant progress we have made in our integration efforts while maintaining strong momentum with our customers.","We continue to make great strides leveraging the best sales force in the industry to serve our customers and drive strong performance in our customer service and satisfaction across the expanded customer base. In summary, I am pleased with the strong second quarter results in Distribution Solutions.","Technology Solutions' revenues were down 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinicals software platform and the disposition of a product line as contemplated in the original guidance we provided for fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating margin in this segment was 18% in the quarter, primarily due to favorable revenue mix and timing. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the mid-teens for the Technology Solutions segment.","I'm pleased with the progress we've made in our Technology Solutions portfolio and the year-to-date improvement we've seen in the core operating margin profile of this segment.","Last quarter, I provided an update on the CommonWell Health Alliance, where McKesson and the other members are pioneering solutions to lead our industry in addressing the issue of data interoperability, to make health information available to the providers who need it when they need it, regardless of where the care occurred.","I continue to be encouraged by the Alliance's ability to demonstrate real-world progress, including the continued addition of new members across the health care ecosystem, successful pilots in 4 geographies, demonstrating real-world data exchanges across disparate systems and most recently, a multiyear agreement for nationwide commercialization of the services, with the core services being provided by RelayHealth.","At McKesson, we are committed to improving health care through data interoperability. Our systems are built on open, contemporary architectures that are low-cost and easy to implement for our customers. The CommonWell Health Alliance members join us in making data available to providers in their current systems, expanding down their current investments without having to replace their existing systems.","As McKesson and other CommonWell members now look to drive nationwide deployment and expansion, we continue to encourage other organizations to help lead our industry and our country in moving the information between platforms to enable better patient care. In summary, we will continue to focus on our key strategic priorities for Technology Solutions: including helping our customers reduce cost and operate more efficiently; providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics; and supporting our customer's transformation to a world of value-based care.","Now to wrap up my comments for fiscal Q2. I'm pleased with our results for the second quarter and the strong execution across all of our businesses in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015.","In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first half of the fiscal year, we've generated cash flow from operations of $165 million, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2015. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I'd like to address a request from some of our investors related to the impact of foreign currency rate movements on our results.","As you might recall in our original guidance for fiscal 2015, we assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro for the full year. For the first half of the year, the average exchange rate was in line with this assumption and thus, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on either our first or second quarter results. However, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are now assuming an average exchange rate during the second half of our fiscal 2015 of $1.27 per euro. This would drive a full year average exchange rate of $1.31 per euro.","This equates to a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04, net of the Celesio noncontrolling interest, during the back half of our fiscal year. However, as John mentioned, we are maintaining our full year outlook for adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 per diluted share.","Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.79, which excludes 3 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 36% for the quarter to $44.8 billion. On this 36% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 46% to $3 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our other Distribution Solutions businesses.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 59% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 1% for the quarter. Other income was $23 million during Q2. Interest expense increased 68% versus the prior year to $99 million, driven by debts issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio.","Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. As a reminder, we still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31.5%.","Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $658 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.79. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million.","Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' segment revenues increased for the quarter to $44 billion, up 37% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $35.1 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%.","Current quarter revenue growth primarily reflects higher-than-expected demand for Sovaldi and Olysio, 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C, market growth and our overall mix of business. For the year, we are forecasting higher-than-planned branded drug sales, which reflect our strong market demand for the 2 hepatitis C drugs and delays in certain generic launches, including Nexium and COPAXONE. As a result, we now expect that our North America revenue will increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full fiscal year.","International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion for the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 58% for the quarter on a 37% revenue growth, resulting in an 80 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin, driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 88% for the quarter due to our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year.","The segment-adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, a decline of 15 basis points versus the prior year, driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, including the effect of the hepatitis C drugs and the brand to generic delays that I just mentioned.","Excluding the impact of both hepatitis C drugs, segment-adjusted operating margin was approximately 250 basis points for the current quarter. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded and generic drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we expect some variability in the impact of pharmaceutical prices from quarter-to-quarter.","Based on the impact of the 2 hepatitis C drugs and the delayed generic launches as well as our assumption that operating profit in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will be down modestly year-over-year, we now expect full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be flat to modestly up over the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $770 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 5%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. Despite the anticipated decline in segment revenues, second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was flat at $139 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 18%, representing an increase of 102 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was based on a favorable revenue mix in the second quarter as well as the effect of reduced expenses.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio.","For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 1 day year-over-year to 49 days.","Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 3 days to 51 days. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations during the first 6 months of fiscal 2015. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, with $2.1 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $272 million for the first half of fiscal '15.","Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 is unchanged but now assumes a second half $1.27 per euro exchange rate.","Before I conclude, I will make a few remarks regarding our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned, we continue to expect that we will achieve operating control of Celesio by the end of calendar 2014. By the fourth year after obtaining operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million.","And finally, with respect to our expected GAAP earnings per share for the full year, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.57 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.97 and $1.07 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.","In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first half of fiscal 2015, and we are well positioned for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Melissa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, can you maybe just talk about drug price inflation in the quarter on the Generics side? The last few quarters, it's been pretty strong, but I didn't hear you specifically call it out in this quarter. Is there anything that's changed?","John H. Hammergren","As we chatted on the first quarter, we believe that some of our second quarter inflation was pulled slightly ahead into the first quarter. Our outlook for the year remains unchanged, down slightly from the inflation rates we experienced last year but still pretty robust. So the second quarter came in line with exactly where we thought it would be when we finished the first quarter comments.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then James, just a numbers question. If I listen to what you said around the delay in Nexium, COPAXONE and the foreign currency, am I right thinking that versus your initial expectations that those things combined are somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.10 headwind versus the initial guidance that you gave us?","James A. Beer","Well, in terms of the initial guide, certainly -- obviously, we're reaffirming the guide that we've outlined earlier in the year so we feel very comfortable with the range. We have been surprised by the strength of the hepatitis C volumes. And they come along with lower margins, as I intimated. Without those 2 hepatitis C drugs, our margin would have been right around the 250 basis point level for Distribution Solutions. So hopefully, that gives you some sense as to the impact of those hepatitis C drugs on our quarter. So that was really an important driver, but overall, we still feel good about the guide even though we have the $0.04 currency headwind that I mentioned as well.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. As well as the delay in the Generics, right?","James A. Beer","Yes.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the combination of those, that's an incremental headwind to what we would have expected post last quarter?","James A. Beer","Yes, that's right. So we referred to generally strength in branded pharmaceutical sales in terms of the mix. And those delays of products like Nexium and COPAXONE are important drivers within that theme.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you speak to the way that you're looking at the noncontrolling interest and your willingness to put cash to work as long as the noncontrolling interest is outstanding? I guess more specifically, do you think that your minimum cash balance, as long as the interest is out, has to encapsulate it? Does it need to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion-plus, whatever it takes to run the business. Or if this looks like it's going to go on for a long period, would you consider using the cash that is offshore?","James A. Beer","Well, in terms of capital allocation, we obviously have to be mindful of the noncontrolling interest that you're mentioning there. Also, we have to be focused on the larger debt maturities that we have coming due in fiscal '16, where the maturities move to the $1.5 billion type level, whereas this year, debt maturities have just been a couple of hundred million dollars in total. So those are important things to bear in mind. But having said that, nothing has changed in terms of our overall portfolio thinking towards capital allocation. And historically, that has meant a balance between M&A, internal capital expenditures as well as share buybacks and dividends. So that's how we're really thinking about cash and the capital allocation equation.","John H. Hammergren","I also think, Eric, it's difficult to forecast when the minority interest or noncontrolling interest purchase would take place. And I think that's one of the other challenges is it may not be 100% in our control, given that they have the ability to put those shares to us.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. So -- but it sounds like you're still approaching the noncontrolling interest as you would any capital allocation decision? Or is there a strategic need to own it?","James A. Beer","Well, again, those minority holders have the right to put their shares to us or we would continue to pay them a defined annual dividend. So this equation is very much in their hands.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. But you don't feel the need to chase that?","James A. Beer","Well, as we've said for our full year guidance -- fiscal '15, we're assuming 76% is going to be our ownership level for Celesio. And again, the core process defined through our independent evaluation are the rights for the minority.","John H. Hammergren","And also, I would remind the listeners that the operating -- operational control process that we're pursuing, that we believe will be completed by the end of the year, is not affected by the ownership position of the company. Once we surpass the 75% ownership position, it allowed us to pursue this activity, which will give us the ability to begin to realize the synergies that we've outlined. And so I -- they are 2 separate and distinct discussions: one is operational control, which is the process that's underway; and the second is the ownership -- the remaining ownership of the 24% that is not currently held by McKesson. And to affect operational control, we do not need to buy any of the additional outstanding shares.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, can you give us a little bit more color on kind of like your thoughts about -- on the European market dynamics in line of the Celesio-revised guidance and your comments on the 3 geographies in Europe and how that compares to kind of like your thought when you provided guidance and entered a transaction?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, the Celesio management team has a responsibility to comment on their results, and I think they did so this morning. I think stepping away from Celesio specifically and looking at the markets, clearly, there is continued price pressure in Germany, in the wholesaler side of the business, and which I think the industry has been talking about for some time. Clearly, the French economy has not performed at the level that some would have had expected. And there's additional pressure in that market. And Brazil has been a challenge for many of the companies that are competing in the Brazilian market. I think the -- anybody that has followed Celesio specifically would recognize that there have been certain operating challenges that they have faced and I believe that they're beginning to address. However, McKesson really can't be involved in their decisions and their actions to correct some of their challenges. I would also remind everyone that the synergies that we believe come from gaining operational control and that we've outlined on a continued basis remain very significant and we believe would also provide another vehicle to offset some of the operating challenges that may exist on a country level within Celesio. And clearly, they highlighted the strength of the U.K. business and the continued performance there, which I think is a positive.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I think John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Rite Aid operational -- operation transition was completed. Should we assume that the contribution from Rite Aid in the quarter is now at full run rate? And also, around kind of like along those lines, you announced that you've extended your contract with CVS from 3 years to 10 years a couple of months ago. Should we assume that, that was also in your updated guidance, assuming that the step-down in pricing is you normally see with product renewals and extensions? Or is this something that we should factor in through fiscal year '16?","John H. Hammergren","Well, the Rite Aid operational completion took place in the quarter, so I would suggest that not 100% of the results were realized in the quarter. But I do think it's certainly bounded by the range that we've provided and continue to support. Likewise, I would say the CVS contract renewal or extension was a -- was contemplated also as we thought about our comments last quarter and this quarter. So I don't think there will be any specific changes to our guidance going forward based on either of those 2 events.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John and James, I wonder if I can kind of revisit Lisa's question in a different way, which is if we look at how you guys came out of Q1, results were really strong and you got the guidance raise. And then kind of as we've moved through now, the company has seen some significant headwinds, but the guidance has been maintained. You talked about the $0.04 euro impact and the FX impact. There's probably a couple of pennies of just weakness in the Celesio business as France and Germany and Brazil deteriorate. Nexium and COPAXONE get pushed out. I guess, what I want to know is would you quantify kind of if we were to -- kind of back to Lisa's $0.10 question, is that the right number? Or would you guys kind of quantify the things that have changed in your -- the things that have changed versus your original expectations, kind of what were they worth and how should we think about those moving pieces?","James A. Beer","Well, I won't have a specific issue-by-issue breakdown for you. But as you note there in your question, we have changed during the year our guide for Distribution and Solutions margins. So originally, before we saw the hep C type volumes, we were thinking that we could grow those margins high single digits. And then as we got a better understanding of the hep C volumes during Q1, we brought that down to the mid-single-digit growth that we talked about 90 days ago. And what we're doing today is again updating that view for these continued growth on the hep C side as well as these other items that you're mentioning that are coming into play, particularly around the brand to generic conversion time lines. So you can kind of think of that margin point progression along the lines of the impact of the hep C drugs originally, and then this quarter, both hep C and the brand to generic conversion.","John H. Hammergren","And I also would say, George, I guess to be more specific, I think you're accurate in your assessment that the strength of the underlying business has offset some of these challenges that we didn't contemplate. So as much as we are missing the margin related to 2 product launches, we've largely been able to grow through that by the strength in our proprietary OneStop Generics program, which even without the Rite Aid volume, grew by more than 20% in the quarter. And the strength in the rest of our operations that continue to deal with the headwinds delivered by the delay in the Generics, the headwind delayed -- the headwind related to the FX, the currency exchange rates, and the headwind delivered by Celesio's revised view of the rest of their year. All of those are built in and yet, we're still optimistic that we'll be within the guidance range that we've provided. So I think people should feel good about the underlying operating results of the business, given those circumstances.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. That's kind of where I'm going, John. And maybe then just a quick follow-up is I'm actually not looking at the margin mix impact, I'm looking at the absolute gross profit dollar growth impact. And kind of x these things, it's safe to assume that gross profit dollar growth would have been stronger than you guys reported. So I guess, James, I would just ask, you talked about the hep C drugs. You guys are making an absolute gross profit dollar on them, they're not loss leaders for you guys. So they're additive to the gross profit line, right?","James A. Beer","They are, but very much more dilutive than the norm from a margin perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","We've heard from some of the retailers about pressures they're experiencing from both generic inflation and reimbursement pressure from payers. I'm just curious, do either of these issues that they're facing have any collateral risk to you? And along those lines, are any of these issues that have arisen at the retail level made others more skeptical of joining some of these purchasing platforms, obviously, specifically McKesson's purchasing platform?","John H. Hammergren","I think it's interesting when you talk about customers because each one of our customers experience their business in an individual way because they're a mix of payers, their view of inflation, their contracting processes, how they price their book, are all different. So I think it's difficult to lump everybody into a giant basket and say this is how they're being affected. And I think that independents clearly have a different book of business than the large chains do and certainly, mail orders, et cetera, have different vehicles by which they offset or take advantage of trends in the business. I would say that McKesson continues to focus on the success of our customers, and we remain extremely flexible in our relationships with our customers to make sure that they're afforded an opportunity to continue to enjoy the efficiencies of doing business with a wholesaler, while at the same time, taking advantage of the opportunities that they may have enjoyed outside of the wholesale channel in the past. I'm absolutely convinced that with the exception of perhaps one of our customers, all of our customers would benefit by buying their generics strictly through McKesson. And I believe that we will continue to make progress on our ability to grow our business on the Generics side more rapidly because of our increased penetration of our existing customers and the strength of our model going forward. So I have no doubt that we will continue to evolve our partnership with our customers in a way that adds value to them and grows our business at the same time.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess just my follow-up around generic purchasing. There is some chatter or concern in the marketplace that maybe some of the synergies that were originally mapped out on paper relative to these purchasing consortiums might not be translating at the actual negotiations level with generic manufacturers. I'm just wondering if you could comment around how your negotiations have progressed as you've gone out to the generic manufacturers around buying better with more scale? And any change relative to the original or previous expectations that you laid out around the procurement benefit?","John H. Hammergren","Well, you've heard us talk regularly and repeatedly about our success with our relationship with Rite Aid, which is clearly our largest example of an alignment of a customer buying off of our contract book and our ability to work together with our combined volumes in a way that delivers benefit to both enterprises. And I think that is the best proof point. I would point out that there are many voices in this discussion. And the voices have different objectives perhaps. And that maybe the objectives of some of those voices is to try to make sure that these purchasing collaboratives, cooperatives, joint ventures, whatever you want to call them are not successful in aggregating volume because it may be to the disadvantage of other people in these channels. And so I -- all I can speak to is the fact that we continue to get the benefits that we had expected as we entered these arrangements. Or we continue to build our book of business, which adds significant value to the manufacturing partners that are part of our solution going forward and deliver significant value to the customers that have availed themselves of not only the price points that are available through McKesson because of our scale, but also to the service offering that we make available to our customers that take them out of the logistics business that is clearly more superior coming from McKesson. So I would say that we remain extremely optimistic, and the data that we're seeing continues to possibly reinforce the decisions we've made around generic sourcing.","James A. Beer","And until we get operating control, we can't even have discussions with the manufacturing partners that include Celesio's volumes.","John H. Hammergren","Right. So that's yet to begin.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I'll also pile on and ask a question on generics as well. But for me, I guess on the inflation, if I recall, I think you were previously including some of the new product launches in your generic inflation outlook, of the high single digits for this year. So I guess with your inflation view unchanged, but with some of these delays and some of the big launches that you've talked about, I presume we would have been high margin. Could we potentially infer that maybe the inflation trend on the older base of generic products is perhaps greater than expected to offset those launch delays? Or am I just -- perhaps I'm reading too much into that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, I think Steven, you asked a very good question, and this is a very confusing discussion for almost everybody involved in it because the definition of generic inflation is done differently by different people in the business. So I think it's important for us to explain how we think about it when we talk about our view of generic inflation being unchanged from the point from which we gave guidance coming into this year. Maybe James can give you a little color on how we define generic inflation.","James A. Beer","Yes, our definition is for generic drugs beyond their exclusivity period. So you can think of those as the more mature drugs. So we would specifically exclude from our commentary those drugs that are just now converting from brand to generic. So again, the experience that we've had thus far this year leaves us comfortable with our full year guide that we would see generics outside of their exclusivity period, rising high single digits year-over-year. So as John alluded to a little bit earlier on one of his responses, that's a smaller year-over-year increase than we saw last year, but still clearly well above the historical norms for generic price inflation.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I appreciate that clarity, but I guess at the same time, it leaves me scratching my head though on the discrepancy then on your view of the generic inflation outlook versus some of the peers that I thought were also definitely excluding those new launches from their inflation outlook but were suggesting lower numbers. So I guess we can follow up off-line on that.","James A. Beer","Yes...","John H. Hammergren","The other thing I'd say, Steven. I know you're off the line now, but I would say that remember, everything we say is related to McKesson's book of business and our mix. So I'm not sure that everybody's mix would be similar to ours or book, so that might be an additional variable that people can't reconcile.","James A. Beer","And then also the way we think about the dollars that we drive from those price increases are very much related to the inventories that we have for those drugs that are seeing the price increases. So you would, I think, naturally see between that as well as the mix point that John is making, a variability across different parties.","John H. Hammergren","And different fiscal years as well.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it seems like Medical continues to track along reasonably well. Can you talk about sort of the next phase of sort of the PSS integration and synergies? It seems like we've sort of moved on from the initial profit capture there. And it seems like the margin profile is still maintaining quite well and hopefully, moving up. And so maybe just give us a little bit of a picture of kind of how that is trending currently.","John H. Hammergren","Now sure, Ross. And the PSS integration has been trending very positively for McKesson. We are through the phase which included the retention of the sales forces and the combination of our sourcing activities and the things we are doing around the brands and compensation systems, et cetera. And now we're into sort of the heavy-lifting phase, which is the consolidation of some of the distribution and transportation infrastructures of the 2 companies. Probably less risk, but maybe even more work, given the amount of energy that has to go into making these consolidations happen, but clearly, there's a lot of value left to harvest out of the integration as we take out some of this duplication from an expense perspective. But most important, I think, was our ability to retain the sales forces with their great relationships with our customers, to continue to focus on our customers' success and our performance with those customers, and now to take some of the cost out that's redundant.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe just on Tech Solutions. Obviously, a very good margin print this quarter. But the revenues, given some of your actions, continue to drag. And it seems like maybe by the end of the year, into early next year, we could possibly get back to revenue growth. I mean, is it your belief, once we sort of comp through these changes, that we can sort of maintain sort of the margin trajectory, hopefully, up to the mid- to upper teens while also kind of -- sort of starting the growth engine in that piece?","John H. Hammergren","That's probably premature to guide on what we might see in the fiscal year ahead or beyond. I would say that our businesses are well positioned, that we know of the business that we've had the biggest challenge with in the EMR kind of space. We do -- we believe that our long-range guidance on margins should be in the high teens. And so clearly, we see that as a continued objective for us in the business. And we should be growing the businesses at or above market rates when we're post this transition of Horizon to Paragon. So I think we remain cautiously optimistic that we're in the right places at the right time. I would certainly point to you and to other listeners that know this business, that we have a very large footprint in medical imaging. Although we have a very significant market share there, the customers have not been focused on imaging products, they have been focused on buying products to meet their requirements from a Meaningful Use perspective. So some of the revenues in that business have been not growing, that we hope will grow again once people get past their obligations to meet government regulations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, as it relates to the kind of ending process of getting operational control of Celesio, is there anything out there in that process either in or outside of your control that might change your expectations relative to the calendar and timing of when you guys do achieve operating control?","John H. Hammergren","I think it's difficult to speak about this process with certainty. I can tell you that our expectations remain that we will get operational control this calendar year. There is a process that's outlined for it, and the parties that are involved have presented their facts and their cases as they see them in the process. And we're hopeful that we'll get an outcome that allows us to move forward with domination, like I said, by the end of the fiscal year. So I think it's difficult to say other than the fact that we remain optimistic and there's been no new news that would cause us to change our view of being optimistic about making it through this process.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is it -- a quick follow-up then, switching gears a little bit. On the logistics side of your business, given the sharp decline in fuel prices here of late, is there any way -- or I guess, is there a meaningful contribution to lower expenses that you guys are seeing from lower fuel prices generally? And is there any way that you guys might be able to help us quantify that benefit?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, there's a benefit in our transportation cost centers across the corporation when fuel prices are in a decline. I'd have to say though, Dave, they're -- in aggregate, they're not a material impact at all to McKesson. And that's something that we focus on in a real specific way. And a portion of our transportation is already outsourced so the benefit would fall to those contract agents that we use in logistics. But I think that it's certainly not a negative event, and we are encouraged by it, but it won't have any meaningful impact on our business.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A little bit of a leading question, perhaps, but thinking about hep C, well, it's perhaps a little bit more than you expected obviously to begin the year and maybe even this quarter. I doubt The Street mismodeled hep C by the nearly $2 billion that you beat in North America pharmaceutical, if I adjust for international. And your Med-Surg revenue also was pretty good. So when I think about that, I think about Owens & Minor this morning beating by 2.5%, 3%. It seems to me like overall market activity, utilization volumes, et cetera, are up. But I haven't really heard you talk much about that tonight, and it's always good to get a distributor to true-up what we're hearing from the labs and hospitals. So I'll just ask you for your comments on the overall market environment.","John H. Hammergren","Sure, Eric. Thanks. We do see, I think, at the margin, an increase in utilization across all of our businesses. I think that almost every one of our executives would say that they believe that there is a certain amount of revenue increase being driven by just more patients in the system and patients in the system that have the appropriate coverage or at least some coverage from an insurance perspective. So I think that it has been a positive component to our results. And I think I'd also add that as people take on more risk for the patients and they're paid for performance, whereas we've talked about paid for value or outcomes, we find that the utilization of pharmaceuticals increases. It's the first and best avenue for people to go to if they have responsibility for a patient to make sure they're on their meds, they stay on their meds, and that I think also will continue to be a fuel for our industry. So I think that in light of what's happening, I think we remain optimistic that this is having some -- at least at the edges, some effect on revenue growth.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","John, if I could ask you this question, I think 1 large European pharma manufacturer is talking about diabetes this morning, talked about some big price competition going on with some of its other competitors. It's kind of new in the sense that these are large-branded categories, would not really need generic competition. I saw a little bit of that, I think, with -- sorry, asthma drugs, a little bit earlier. Can you talk about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the market on the brand side here? And does that have any positive or negative effects for you as the distributor?","John H. Hammergren","Well, we continue to see innovation on the brand side as we've talked about with some of the specialty drugs that have come out. I have to admit that I'm not that close to some of the diabetes work that you refer to. And I do think that as we've talked about, we continue to see price increases on the brand side in line with our expectations and sort of the historical performance. So I think what -- reflecting that at a 40,000-foot level, I think we're pleased to see innovation returning to the brand world, and these companies are not only going to make a difference in people's lives, but they certainly will help provide additional fuel for our industry. So I think that, that would be my takeaway.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. Then maybe if I can just follow up then on hep C more specifically. As we go into next year and we get more competition in the class, does that offer you some opportunities? Or is it really a function here that brand drugs remain -- that the margins, regardless of the manufacturer, will likely be small for you guys in this category?","John H. Hammergren","Well, it's difficult to forecast specialty drugs or new drug launches in a sort of a uniform way. Clearly, some of these drugs will be launched in oncology, and we're very optimistic that when new launches happen in oncology, they're not only better for the patients, but they're also, because of our position in oncology, better for our business. And we benefit from the position we have in that marketplace and can help the manufacturers get their product not only through clinical trial, but also utilized in the correct fashion. And that provides an opportunity for us economically. The hep C product, because of its unusual orientation towards government buyers and mail-order buyers, has an unusual distortion, so to speak, in our volume because of our footprint in those markets. And so I would say that other specialty launches may not have a similar characteristic in terms of the uptake of the product. And so each channel has a different characteristic for us from an economic perspective. But overall, we're happy to see the innovation happen.","Operator","We'll take a question from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So as more hep C drugs come to market, say, next year, is that generally a positive for your margins?","John H. Hammergren","Well, hep C has been a negative for our margins. As James discussed, it was a significant impact in the quarter for our margins and will continue to be a drag on our ability to get to our guided margin for the year, and that's why we've changed it and were specific about it. Over the long term, clearly, we believe this stuff will flow through the system and we were still confident with our long-term objectives of 250 to 300 basis points for Distribution Solutions. Clearly, we need to continue to evaluate the economics of these products as related to the service we provide to both the manufacturers and to our customers. And we need to make sure we're being properly paid by the channel for the role that we play. And hep C clearly would be a product that we would focus on, and future products of this characteristic, we would have to focus on to make sure that the dilutive margin effect that it's had doesn't continue.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Yes. It's clear that as a percentage of revenue, your gross margins would have an unfavorable impact. But as more competing hep C products come to market, relative to having only, say, 1 vendor like Gilead, would you generally earn more gross profit dollars as competition comes to market for that therapeutic class?","John H. Hammergren","Well, that's a good question. I think the ability for us to be paid for affecting the competition would require us to have some role in the channel. And it's not clear to me that we would be in a position to tell our mail order customers, for example, which hep C drug they're going to put on their formulary. So in that specific example, it may be difficult for us to increase our margins specifically because of an additional launch in the category of another branded product. It will probably not provide the same ability for us to move share that, for example, generic drugs provide us. So I'm not particularly optimistic about that single event.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just any preliminary thoughts around fiscal 2016, the impact of new generic launches? It seems like with these pushes, there could be a positive comp impact for fiscal '16, and it seems like there could be some pretty big ones, Nexium, COPAXONE, ABILIFY, maybe Enbrel and Advair. Any general thoughts around that?","John H. Hammergren","Well, clearly, to the extent that these positives are pushed into next fiscal year, then that's where they will be realized. And so I think we remain optimistic that our position in Generics is doing nothing but improving. And that as our scale and our footprint expands globally, we'll be able to bring even more value to the market relative to the generic manufacturers and to partner even more closely with them. So yes, I'd say on the margin, we're excited about the Generic portfolio as we look forward.","Operator","We will take our last question from Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to go back to Celesio. You stated how your expectations are to have operational control by year-end and the fast-track approval. So I'm wondering if it's not, what's the alternate method entail? So maybe if you could give a worse case or best case range of outcomes there, I would really appreciate it.","John H. Hammergren","Well, thank you for the question, Garen. I don't know that we have a firm view on the time line or the potential outcome in terms of how long it would take us to gain operational control. I think if we don't get it in the fast-track process, we remain extremely optimistic that we will get it. And then it's just a question of why didn't the fast-track happen and what do we need to do to facilitate the right decision, which is to give us operational control later on in the process. And so I think it's difficult to speculate.","James A. Beer","But all of that said, we still remain confident that we are going to get operating control in this calendar year.","John H. Hammergren","Well, I want to thank you, operator, and also, I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm pleased with our solid results in the second quarter and I want to recognize our employees who dedicate themselves to focusing on our customer's success and continue to drive outstanding performance across our businesses. I will now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 11, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. And on January 13, we will present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

And here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today, as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for Fiscal 2017.","Let's start with our revised Fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities, and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends, compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions.","As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our cost alignment plan that was previously announced in March of 2016.","As we built our plan and entered Fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. First generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve.","In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, this softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing. While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price, but by service, innovation that helps our customers partner, manage, and run their operations, and manage their capital more effectively, and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way.","Now, price is always a consideration. We provide our customers with premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive, and across several areas of our U.S. pharmaceutical business.","As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured.","We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing, and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance, relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.","As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated, based on their historical and our historical experience.","What we have seen this year to-date, our fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full-year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningfully below those experienced in Fiscal 2016.","Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contracts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated, but generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer, but also by the service requirement at the product level.","Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts, and a specific behavior of the manufacturers that are our party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exist.","Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago, before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels.","So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions, relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data.","But the mix matters. So even relatively small changes in behavior could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by brand and generic inflations.","So what does all of this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation, relative to the services and value we deliver, amidst a softer pricing environment.","Now, turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share, versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with a larger impact coming from competitive pricing.","Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then, we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance. Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations, and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market.","Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores.","We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving.","I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful onboarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network, another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies.","Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the UK government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the UK's decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we've made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate.","In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers.","We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets. As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team, even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare, while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives.","In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses.","Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago.","These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full-year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders.","Our leadership team and I met with each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforce my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity and, clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future.","We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well-positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions. Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website.","This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses.","To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also, in the second quarter, we recorded pre-tax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the cost alignment plan.","Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed.","We expect these two headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the two impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items including savings from ongoing cost management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment. A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slides 17 and 18.","I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook. We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges, to be approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points. We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.","Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter.","While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our cost alignment plan and additional ongoing cost management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth. And I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the cost alignment plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal 2017, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all four elements of our portfolio approach.","Now, let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $3.17.","Now, I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity.","Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan as well as ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter.","Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge was 25.4%, driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $2.94 decreased 7% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million.","Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 12% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the quarter driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments.","Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed.","Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was down 7% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our cost reduction actions.","Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin excluding unusual items of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased six days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.","We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore. In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program.","Now, moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed, and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017.","The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pre-tax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant one-time gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo.","Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%, thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year, after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings.","Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million, after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings.","Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first-year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare.","While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed-upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner.","In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Noah?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. So, John, having been covering this company a long time, I can't recall the last time we had a discussion on competitive pricing. And so, I guess what do you think caused that part of the environment to change over the last three or six months? And obviously, the magnitude that you've given is quite large, and so it's a fairly substantial change.","Obviously, we're seeing a lot of different constituents talk about drug pricing and all sorts of other things, but this seems actually unrelated. And so help us just understand, one, what you think caused this, how you think the industry will then respond and hopefully heal. And then, secondarily, on your end, I guess how we should put this into context of what has happened historically, if there's anything that you would compare this to.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Let me start with that, Ross. I have seen this, obviously, throughout my career. But we also saw it at McKesson that where, in particular, we took a step function down with pricing. You may recall, I think in the early part of 2008, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we are facing now. It happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then. And that gave us a stream of profitability that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time.","You'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market.","I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time. And from time to time, those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected.","So it has happened before. We covered through those periods of time. And like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That was helpful. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And John, you may have just spoken to it because you called out the pricing pressure, and I wanted to see if you could comment on which market sub-segments are you seeing the pricing pressure the most. It seems like you spoke to independents, but also is it in the independents and the franchisees and the big boxes? I guess any more color on the pricing pressure would be helpful.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, thanks for the question, George. I think the most acute area right now is in our independent segment. And clearly, that's a place where you have lots of customers that had long-term relationships, but they also can be fluid. And I think what we've tried to say today is that we plan to maintain our share positions and to grow our business on the value we deliver. And that's really what we're after. The rest of our segments are always competitive, but this is the most material impact we've seen in some time.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just my only follow-up would be from a quantification perspective. You gave us the basis point impact. But is there a way to think about the magnitude of the pricing change in that segment that you're seeing? Quantify that. I'm sorry.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, I think James talked a little bit about the reduction in our expectations and how that split with a larger portion really coming from the price pressure we feel. And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude. And clearly, the independent segment for us is a very valuable and important franchise and we have a lot of business there. So I think that between those comments, you should really get a sense directionally for the size of the challenge.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. John, just looking at the industry, my understanding was always that a bigger component of your margin actually came from the manufacturers versus the customer relationships. So can you talk about what's happening on that side of your business?","And our understanding has been that inventory management agreements cover 80% or 85%. What are you seeing in that other 15% to 20%? Is that having a direct correlation on what you're seeing as far as the reduction in earnings as well?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Right. There really are two factors, and I'll have James talk a little bit about the manufacturers in a minute. Because that obviously, when we talk about brand price inflation trends and we tried to quantify once again in our prepared comments how much of this challenge we had this quarter and the forecast for year is coming from that component, we do have some variability that resides in that part of our business.","Clearly, the manufacturers that play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value and we plan to continue to do so.","On the customer side, it's not unimportant I think to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. And albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business.","That generic business is a source of profitability, and there is obviously flexibility in how we price those generics. And there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics. James, maybe you can talk a little bit about the manufacturer side.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. In terms of when we came into the year, we were assuming that the level of brand manufacturer or pricing inflation would be modestly below what we had seen in the previous fiscal year. And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a third reduction versus our original expectations.","The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now, a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80%, 20% type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component.","In part, the contracts have evolved. But also in part as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I peg that split more at 90%, 10%. 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points is still being able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","James, can you help us understand what the actual rate of inflation was last year, when you say you expected it to be down, but now it's meaningfully down? Is there a number you can put around that?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","I wouldn't throw out a specific number, but that's why I articulate, the decline that we have seen in the inflation rate is greater than a third of the original expectation for the year. So it's a significant decline.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I think, Lisa, also, when we look at what we come up with from a calculation perspective on branded inflation, it's plus or minus what you'll see from published sources of inflation. But it is also important to point out that those averages sometimes don't necessarily tell the whole story, because of the mix, or the relationship, or the individual products that are going up or going down in the portfolios can be materially different. And so I do think the economics aren't always necessarily driven with the direct correlation to the average price increases that everybody talks about.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. I'm going to take this in a little bit of a different direction. I just want to clarify relative to the Change Healthcare deal. James, if you don't mind going back over it, so you said, I believe, $1.10 to $1.30 of dilution from the deal, offset by some other estimate. So is that $1.10 or $1.30 a net dilution deal number to the entire business, or is that offset by those benefits, in which case we're on our own to make the assumptions on that front?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. So you should think of the $1.10 to $1.30 as the combined effect of the two items that I discussed. The impact of the deferred revenue and then the impact of the higher interest expense on $6.1 billion worth of debt. So wanted to put quantification around those two items. Then, the other comment I made was getting at the reality that as we're actually operating the business and starting to drive the synergies, the EPS that will drive from the contributed assets, if you will, our share of NewCo will be greater than the ability of those assets, absent our deal with Change Healthcare, to drive EPS.","So there's an accretive effect, if you will, on that element of the equation. As you would expect, when we come together and drive synergies in a deal. But there are also going to be these two large, very distinct items that will drive dilution, the interest expense and the deferred revenue, haircut you could call it, and that those two items total to this $1.10 to $1.30 range that I mentioned.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I know this is a complicated transaction. I appreciate the color. I'll let other people ask some other questions.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess to that, James, do you have any growth forecasts for each of the businesses, EIS and the others? I don't think I see them anywhere. And just maybe, can you speak to the inventory environment? I know last year you scaled up inventory meaningfully in the third quarter. This year you liquidated some. I mean, does that not account for some of the profit shortfall? I know you say you don't do it, but isn't there some opportunity associated with that practice from a profit standpoint that maybe fell out of the model?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","There was nothing unusual in the third quarter. You would very normally have an inventory build as you come into the winter season. So no, I wouldn't point to anything odd around inventory management. Our cash flow was obviously a bright spot in our numbers here, and that was very much a result of ongoing working capital management initiatives, these sorts of things that have been going on at McKesson for years as well as our underlying operating profitability obviously as well. But the working capital initiatives have been important focus for us, and we'll continue to have that.","The first part of your question, the technology businesses, I wouldn't get into specific growth rates around EIS or any particular segment of the business. Overall, we feel as though our technology segment is performing very nicely, they're very much where we expected them to be at this point in the year. Even though there, as John mentioned in his remarks, is plenty of work going on around setting up the new company or preparing to set up the new company, so we've been pleased that they've been able to maintain their focus. And so we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses generally.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just a clarification. James, you did liquidate inventory in the September quarter of this year that did not scale up. Is it just a combined effect of all the businesses resulted in a modest reduction?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. What I was observing is, in Q3, you would normally have an inventory buildup as you go into the winter season. So yes, that's right.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. Yeah, John, I guess like others I'm surprised to hear you highlight competitive pricing, just given how rational the industry has been for so long. And I guess if I take a step back, this year alone, we've seen the negative impact to profitability from generic pricing, moderating. Now, we're talking about a slowdown in branded inflation. Is there any thought that those dynamics themselves are what are forcing your competitors to maybe go harder after market share to make up for what seemingly would have created a shortfall in profit?","And then, I guess more importantly, how sustained do you think this competitive behavior could be? Do you think this is more of a one-off, a few accounts that they went after harder, or do you think this could potentially be a more lasting changing dynamic?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","I think those are all good questions. I think that the best way for me to answer them would be the way we think at McKesson. I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for.","And as I've seen in the past when \u2013 we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things happen, with some of the profit pools become more difficult. What typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. My best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us, and in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success.","And that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful, because customers don't want a change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, hey, listen, can you match this deal because I'd like to stay with you. And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Co.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, James or John, when we think about the reduction in guidance for the year, can you give us a split, maybe, between how much you think is coming from the customer side, versus how much is from the brand inflation side? Is it half and half or...?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. So a couple of points. In terms of the negative effects, I would say it's the competitive pricing having a greater impact than the brand manufacturer price inflation rate. But also, remember that we offered $1.60 to $1.90 range for those two items. We're bringing the overall company range down by less than that because we've got tailwinds in our view around our tax rate, around our share count, around our interest expense and so forth. So that's going to drive the delta between the two ranges that we're offering today.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then to just follow up on the brand inflation side. Obviously, I think most people coming in would have thought, hey, the elections are a factor driving this. How are you guys thinking about it as we move into next year post-elections? Obviously, a lot of spotlight on Congress right now on this topic. How are you at this point thinking about \u2013 do you think it bounces back, or do you think this is maybe the new normal and we have to wait for the anniversary? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think the view we have is sort of a year-to-date view. We have the same information that you have and probably the same visibility. And we're just guessing as to what manufacturers are likely to do going forward like everybody else. They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything, other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior, obviously, has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of \u2013 at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred.","And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements.","And so I think that a common person's view would be that you'd still see inflation at some levels. I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect.","But, yeah, it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Is it possible to renegotiate these contracts on the fly, or is it you have to wait as the terms come up? And I'll stop there. Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think anything is possible. We typically have renegotiated the contracts when they come up as opposed to whenever we're under significant pressure. I think that we always have the opportunity to go back to manufacturers and demonstrate once again the value that we deliver.","And in particular, where manufacturer's behavior has changed dramatically from its previous behavior and we had come to depend on those mechanisms as part of our funding source with that manufacturer, I think we have every right to go back to those manufacturers and say, listen, we need to open the dialog again because by your unilateral decision, you have significantly impacted our profitability on your particular product lines and we don't think that's fair and we want to recover that lost margin. So I think that that certainly is something we plan to pursue.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So a few questions here. First of all, just to clarify, John, when you talk about inflation being meaningfully lower, I hear you saying that year-to-date you're seeing greater than a third reduction. And I think going back to past comments, I think you saw 12% last year for your fiscal year. We're getting to around fiscal year 7% year-to-date.","But when you think about the December quarter and the March quarter, which usually has a lot of inflation, in your assumption are you assuming that the second half you're going to see that same reduction that you've seen year-to-date? Or are you assuming some acceleration in that given that all the commentary we're hearing about the industry trying to self-regulate? I'm just trying to better understand are you clearing the decks here with this $1.60 to $1.90? Or could there be potentially more downside if in the second half of your fiscal year brand inflation decelerates even more?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","James, why don't you...","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. Ricky, to answer your question very directly, what we've assumed for the back half of fiscal 2017 is a continuation of the inflation rate that we have experienced year-to-date.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So basically the same type of price increases that we've seen year-to-date to continue for the next couple of quarters.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yes.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then when we think about the sell side pressure that you're talking about, is that a number that we can take and annualize into next year? And I think my point being is that, obviously, it's a (57:26) and when we think about the margin implication. Is it fair to assume that you just repriced that portion of the contracts that are perennial for this year, or have you also gone proactively to your customers and locked in contracts that are going to come up in the next year or two at a new pricing level?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think those are, obviously, both good questions. I think to the point that James is making when he answered it a moment ago, we typically see stronger price inflation as you get into our third and fourth quarters. And so when we say we're guiding on a year-to-date basis, that already tells you that we believe there'll be some moderation in those quarters relative to previous behaviors.","On the sell side, it's a little bit more difficult to make projections because we're basically in a position where we are reacting to some extent and not being the people that are making the decision. I think that our view is that we have made a very significant change in our pricing practice to match where the market is today. And we, like I said to answer another question that was asked, we have seen this kind of event happen in the past as well and we didn't see a continuation of the event. And our objective is to continue to maintain our market share.","So I think we believe we provided guidance that has reasonable expectations from that perspective and that you can count on the range. That's one of the reasons that the range is somewhat wider, though, is it's somewhat dependent on what happens going forward.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So I think that one of the things that we are all trying to get a better sense of is when we think about fiscal year 2018 and I fully understand that you're not guiding to 2018 and there are a lot of moving parts, but is it reasonable for us to take that $1.60 to $1.90 in EPS impact that we're going to see in the second half of the year and just use it as a run rate for fiscal year 2018 just for these two components?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, at this very early stage, Ricky, it's really I don't think it's appropriate for us to try to make any predictions about FY 2018. So I think really we should leave that for closer to the start of that fiscal year. And we'll, obviously, be getting into our guidance process as normal.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm just assuming all steady state, right? So if you're seeing the step-down in your sell side margin, traffic to the EPS impact is going to just slow through...","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. No, I...","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess that's the question right now.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","I understand the logic. It's just hard for me to take a position on FY 2018 at this very early stage.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, I think it's a difficult question to answer. But I think \u2013 I did try to at least bound the conversation around customer pricing, in that this is a pretty significant step-down, and we believe that that allowed us to maintain the relationships with our customers, given what was a pricing environment where we were higher-priced than where we needed to be, and that has occurred, and it's baked into the guidance that we have provided you, in terms of the range that we just refreshed. Now, I think to James' point, it's pretty early to speculate on what branded inflation might be next year, and what else might happen with our customer base. But we tried to give you as much visibility as we possibly can.","I know you guys are on a short timeframe. Let me close this call, if I can, and let you know that \u2013 I know you share with us the disappointment in today's news. This is not what we had expected, and certainly not what we want. But despite this downward revision to our outlook, we do believe in and remain committed to the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and our manufacturing partners. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we believe the increased competitive pricing activity does not build sustainable customer relationships or long-term shareholder value, and we are all about sustainable relationships, and creating long-term shareholder value.","And we're supported by McKesson's great tradition of customer focus, operational excellence and disciplined execution. And our talented workforce, robust cash flow generation, and strong balance sheet position us for the long-term value creation that we strive to obtain. We remain as committed as ever to our value proposition.","And I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On January 10, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Holly Weiss","Thank you, Ebony. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today\u2019s press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our website at investor.mckesson.com.","With that, let me turn it over to Brian.","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Holly, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we\u2019re going to focus on our fiscal 2019 results and our outlook for fiscal 2020. Britt will cover our financial performance in greater detail, but first let me take a couple of minutes to discuss some of our important accomplishments and why we\u2019re so confident in McKesson\u2019s future.","During our fiscal 2019, we saw increasing momentum in our strategic growth initiative, including priority areas that focused on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals or biopharma services, and the expanding role of retail pharmacy in community health services, all this supported by our ongoing investments in data and analytics. We also continued to optimize our operating model to improve our cost position, and the overall speed and effectiveness of the organization.","We recently renewed our CVS agreement. This follows renewal of our Rite Aid agreement and a two-year extension of our Veterans Affairs agreement earlier in the year. We believe our strong value proposition and superior service quality were critical to allow us to continue supporting the success of these customers, and we are very pleased to continue these longstanding partnerships.","We made several changes to strengthen our leadership team including the promotion of Kirk Kaminsky as President of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment; the promotion of Kevin Kettler as the President of our Europe segment; and the hiring of a new leader for our UK business. ","More recently, we appointed Tracy Faber as our Chief Human Resource Officer to succeed Jorge Figueredo upon his retirement later this year.","In our medical business, we acquired Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD, which has among other things, expanded our value proposition with manufacturers and brought specialty infusion capabilities and services. It is progressing in line with its business case. And Change Healthcare filed its S-1 with an intention to complete an IPO, market conditions permitting.","In terms of overall performance for the quarter, I\u2019m pleased with our adjusted EPS of $3.69, up 6% versus the prior year driven by solid execution across multiple businesses. And for the year, we were able to deliver results that were in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year.","Our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of $13.57 represents 8% year-over-year growth. Despite the challenging industry environment we faced in fiscal 2019, as a company, I\u2019m pleased with our results. We have scaled businesses in many good markets and we are a critical resource to providers in the community care setting. Through our 80,000 associates acting together, we successfully delivered for our customers, executed and took decisive action to position McKesson for success over the long haul.","Looking forward now to fiscal 2020. Our fiscal 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share represents low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year growth. This outlook reflects solid growth across our operating segments, a continuation of disciplined efficient capital deployment, investments in the business, increased cost for opioid litigation and modestly improved UK results. I will remind you that this guidance is inclusive of our organic growth and our organic \u2013 and our strategic growth initiatives. Britt will cover this in more detail.","I\u2019ll now touch on developments in each of our businesses during the past year, which provide a platform to deliver [indiscernible] organic growth. In our European Pharmaceutical segment, we experienced sizable UK government reimbursement cuts, which we have previously discussed, and we took additional actions this quarter to further rationalize our footprint and back office operations in Europe. Overall, for Europe, we anticipate revenue to be growing by low-to-mid single digits, driven by market growth with no incremental UK cuts contemplated in our fiscal 2020 guide.","In Medical-Surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth across all of our customer channels and we are well positioned to support the growing alternate site markets. The acquisition of MSD and our investments in home delivery help us meet the needs of the patient wherever it suits them and further supports our growth in this segment. For the medical segment, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the high-single-digit range for fiscal 2020.","Now, turning to other, which primarily comprises McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Canada and our investment in Change Healthcare. MRxTS is a fundamental part of our strategy to improve healthcare one patient, one prescription, one partner at a time. We are excited by innovative solutions like RxBenefit Clarity, which provides transparency around prescription pricing at the point of prescribing for any medication and all payors.","Physicians and patients are excited about this tool and a fast-growing number of them, currently over 100,000, benefit from information they can really use to make timely decisions. We believe we can do much more to improve transparency for patients and to improve adherence by enhancing the ability of patients, pharmacists to collaborate with their prescribing physicians.","In Canada, we made significant progress to mitigate the impact of government actions as we move through fiscal 2019. Our Canadian retail presence combined with Well.ca, which, by the way, was recognized by Forrester as the Number one digital retailer in Canada in 2018 provides patients with another channel to connect with us and we\u2019ve been piloting our future retail pharmacy concept that evolves the patient experience, which is currently being expanded to more sites.","We also announced a collaboration with Google Cloud that will able us to accelerate how we leverage our data to develop insights and predictive capabilities that will support better patient outcomes and reduce waste. In combination, we expect other to deliver a flat to low-single-digit revenue decline for fiscal 2020.","We remain confident in McKesson\u2019s path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In particular, we have a scaled presence across important community care settings, including community pharmacies, specialty providers, oncology, alternate sites, which are all critical to addressing the nation\u2019s cost, quality and access challenges.","Before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to share our perspective on the evolving drug pricing reform landscape and opioid litigation. Given our broad capabilities and the multitude of customers and channels that we serve are sometimes referred to 360-degree view of the supply chain. We\u2019ve been actively engaged with the administration, Congress and industry stakeholders to provide thought leadership on a range of proposed policy changes.","The breadth and depth of our enterprise-wide assets provides a platform for developing new solutions that can help the industry adapt. Our MRxTS or our Pharmacy Technology business has been investing in real time benefits tools and cost transparency solutions for patients, prescribers and pharmacies, so they can make informed choices about the cost of therapy. As we move towards the world potentially without rebates, our manufacturer partners and pharmacy customers are interested in exploring new and innovative operating models. We\u2019re committed to being part of that solution.","We have differentiated technology capabilities that can help move a solution forward, leveraging our retail health, pharmacy switch, and assets and capabilities like our chargeback platform in our wholesale business. Our unique experience in value-based programs such as the Oncology Care Model optimally position us to support the evolving needs of providers as they adapt to new care delivery models and value-based payment programs.","With respect to opioid litigation, you are all well aware of the scope and complexity of litigations facing McKesson and many members of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Last week, we announced a settlement with the State of West Virginia. The settlement resolves all the state\u2019s past claims regarding McKesson\u2019s operations in West Virginia. While we deny wrongdoing, it\u2019s important to us that this settlement provides funding towards initiative intended to address the opioid epidemic itself. We remain committed to resolving other claims and more importantly to being part of the solution to this public health crisis.","For example, we have contributed $100 million to a foundation focused on combating the crisis. We\u2019ve been educating our customers to comply with regulations and identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We\u2019ve advocated for solutions identified in our white paper, call to action; execute solutions today to combat the opioid epidemic. These solutions in our white paper include the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law last year and the ALERT Act, which, if passed, would establish a prescription safety alert system to help identify patients at risk for opioid abuse.","Finally, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their continuing dedication, leadership and consistent focus on a safe and secure supply chain as we strive to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. I\u2019m continually inspired by letters I receive from patients who\u2019d tell us about our associates consistently going the extra mile to ensure great health outcomes.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Britt.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll provide an update on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results, and then I\u2019ll close by providing our fiscal 2020 guidance before turning to your questions.","My comments will focus primarily on our adjusted earnings results. However, I want to start by discussing two items that impacted our GAAP-only results. As a result of the dynamic market environment, regulatory headwinds and business performance in our European segment, we recorded an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and restructuring charges that are largely in our European business. The impairment charges were mainly due to declines in estimated future cash flows, primarily attributable to the effects of UK government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the UK. Following this charge, there is no remaining goodwill balance in our European business.","The restructuring charges in our European business are related to actions taken to address our performance in the segment. We\u2019re working to reinforce and accelerate our UK restructuring through further closures of retail pharmacy stores and cost management efforts throughout Europe. We anticipate recording additional restructuring charges in future periods as we execute on planned actions. We remain focused on our business performance in the UK and Europe more broadly, and we\u2019ve taken these actions to better position the business for the future.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our fiscal 2019 results. As a reminder, our initial fiscal year 2019 guidance called for adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to $13.80. Despite significant regulatory and competitive headwinds, fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS was $13.57, 8% above fiscal 2018 and above the midpoint of our initial guidance. And fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $3.69 per diluted share were ahead of our expectations. We exit the year with another quarter of solid performance and remain focused on building upon this positive momentum as we enter fiscal 2020.","Starting with the details of our full year fiscal 2019 consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues for the year increased 3% versus fiscal 2018, primarily driven by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, acquisitions, and organic growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we\u2019ve discussed previously.","Adjusted gross profit was up 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Medical-Surgical and contributions from acquisitions. These positive developments were partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, headwinds in our European segment and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business.","Fiscal 2019 adjusted operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, principally driven by acquisitions, increased opioid-related litigation costs, investments to support growth, including incremental spend on data and analytics capabilities and information security, and charges related to the Q3 fiscal 2019 bankruptcy of Shopko within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the $100 million contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioids in Q4 fiscal 2018, the $90 million reversal during Q2 fiscal 2019 of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business.","Adjusted income from operations was $3.8 billion for the year, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Interest expense was $264 million for the year, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year, reflecting fiscal 2018 fourth quarter refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Adjusted tax rate was 17.8% for the year, mainly driven by our mix of business and discrete tax benefits. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $221 million for the year, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 197 million for the year, a decrease of 6% year-over-year.","Next, I\u2019ll discuss our full year segment results, which can be found on Slide 6 through 9, and let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $167.8 billion for the year, up 3% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses in branded to generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the year was down 2% to $2.5 billion due to fiscal 2018 customer losses and the ShopKo bankruptcy, which offset higher growth in our specialty business and acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 150 basis points, a decrease of eight basis points.","Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Fiscal 2019 revenues were flat to fiscal 2018 at $27.2 billion for the year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 1% driven by solid performance outside of the UK, mostly offset by the fiscal 2018 reduction of approximately 200 retail pharmacies and challenging market environments in the UK and France. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 36% to $219 million, and on an FX adjusted basis, down 35% to $220 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 80 basis points on both the reported and an FX adjusted basis, which was a decrease of 44 basis points. The decline in this segment was driven by headwinds in the UK, which included inventory charge of approximately $20 million.","Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $7.6 billion for the year, which were up 15% driven by the Medical Specialties Distributors, or MSD, acquisition and growth in our primary care business, most notably from growth in pharmaceutical products and lab solutions. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue grew 6%.","Segment adjusted operating profit for the year increased 11% to $605 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, and ongoing cost management, partially offset by additional investments to support business growth. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 794 basis points, a decrease of 29 basis points, driven by growth in lower margin pharmaceutical products and investments in our patient home delivery business.","Finishing our business review with other. Revenues were $11.7 billion for the year, down 1%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses within this segment, partially offset by the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in fiscal 2018.","Other adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $1 billion on an FX adjusted basis, driven mainly by growth in our MRxTS business and a $9 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in the second quarter. This was partially offset by the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business and the impact of the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada. Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $242 million for the year.","Next, McKesson recorded $555 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. There are a few discrete items impacting the expense growth, led by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs and investments in technology infrastructure. These items were partially offset by the fiscal 2018 contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioid, which is detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, we\u2019re executing on cost discipline, an important component to driving leverage, and a key part of our financial model that we have confidence in driving and sustaining over the long term.","Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. Our cash flow remains dependably strong as we remain focused on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.5 billion in free cash flow, which includes $557 million spent on capital expenditures. With the scale of our distribution businesses, there can be variability in our cash flows from quarter-to-quarter, including the day of the week a quarter ends on. A portion of the fiscal 2019 performance was due to favorable timing in our U.S. distribution and European businesses.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion. And in fiscal 2019, we returned $1.9 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we have a total of $3.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Before turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020, I\u2019d like to make a few comments as it relates to the fourth quarter. Our detailed results are provided in our press release, so I\u2019ll just hit a few of the highlights.","Consolidated revenue grew 3% on an FX adjusted basis. Revenue was led by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and acquisitions, partially offset by the Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we\u2019ve discussed previously.","Adjusted earnings per share were $3.69, up 6% for the quarter. This result exceeded our expectation and was led by a lower share count, strong performance in Medical-Surgical and MRxTS, offset by the weak Europe segment results, principally driven by the inventory charge in the UK and a higher tax rate.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, led by strong working capital performance and some favorable timing.","In summary, adjusted operating profit performance was ahead of our expectations in our segments with the exception of Europe. Earnings per share were in line with the most recent guidance range, despite increased opioid litigation costs and investments in technology, and we generated strong free cash flow above our target. Overall, we demonstrated progress in many areas, but importantly, there\u2019s room to improve on all metrics.","Now let me turn to our fiscal 2020 outlook. The dynamic macro environment from this past fiscal year, which was led by regulatory impacts, particularly in our international retail markets, uncertainty regarding the outcome of several U.S. drug pricing proposals, reimbursement headwinds, and increased opioid-related litigation costs, will continue to confront us in fiscal 2020. We continue to invest in several strategic initiatives and we\u2019re making solid progress against our cost in operating model programs. We\u2019ve attempted to construct guidance ranges that reflect these components.","We expect adjusted earnings per share of $13.85 to $14.45 for fiscal 2020, which contemplates adjusted operating profit growth across each of our segments, including our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and we will continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner.","Please refer to our press release and Slides 11 to 14 in our supplemental slide presentation for our full list of fiscal 2020 assumptions. In lieu of outlining each assumption, I\u2019ll instead walk you through the key items, and I\u2019ll start with the segment.","In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by market growth, including strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, primarily driven by growth in our specialty business and ongoing cost management. In the US market, we anticipate mid-single-digit percent branded pharmaceutical price increases, consistent with our experience in fiscal 2019. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our contracts with branded manufacturers are on a fixed fee rate for service basis.","As Brian noted, we are pleased to have renewed our agreement with CVS Health. Both the CVS Health renewal and the Rite Aid renewal during fiscal 2019 are included in our fiscal 2020 expectations for the segment.","Moving to the European Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth. Adjusted operating profit is also expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, driven by solid performance in countries outside of UK and cost management programs, including the benefit from recent restructuring actions. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in our UK business with no incremental reimbursement cuts contemplated. We\u2019re focused on executing against key initiatives to strengthen the business in the UK and bolster the performance in other European countries.","Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, we expect high-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by the shift of care to lower cost settings, increased demand in patient home delivery, and growth in pharmaceutical products. We expect high single to low double digit percent adjusted operating profit growth, reflecting organic growth, synergies from the MSD acquisition, benefits from fiscal 2019 investments in the patient home delivery business, and operating expense leverage.","For the remaining businesses included in other, revenue is expected to be approximately flat to down by a low-single-digit percent, driven by the exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business, partially offset by anticipated volume expansion and increasing sales in MRxTS.","Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percent, driven principally by the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in our second quarter of fiscal 2019.","For Change Healthcare, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, which assumes that our ownership continues at 70% throughout fiscal 2020. As a reminder, Change Healthcare Inc., which owns the remaining 30% of Change Healthcare, filed its S-1 with the SEC on March 15, 2019. It continues to make progress towards a potential IPO. We will not comment specifically on the anticipated performance of the business, I\u2019d instead refer you to SEC filings by Change Healthcare Inc. for further information.","Moving on now to corporate expenses. As detailed in our press release, our fiscal [indiscernible] guidance contemplates increased corporate expenses year-over-year. This assumption reflects an increase in opioid-related litigation costs to approximately $150 million, an increase over fiscal 2019 of approximately $70 million related to technology investments, most notably infrastructure, and data and analytics investments, investments related to our strategic growth initiatives, and a decline in other income.","As a result of these items, we anticipate adjusted corporate expenses will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million for fiscal 2020. While we\u2019re not providing an outlook beyond fiscal 2020 today, we anticipate that investments related to technology, our growth investments and initiatives, and operating model optimization efforts will be higher in fiscal 2020 than future fiscal years.","Now turning to the consolidated view. We expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth and adjusted income from operations is anticipated to be flat to down by a low-single-digit percent. While we expect adjusted operating profit growth in the majority of our businesses, this growth will be partially offset by the higher corporate expenses that I outlined earlier.","We remain particularly focused on lowering operating expenses across the organization, in addition to the important progress we\u2019re making on our operating model optimization. As a result of recent restructuring efforts, we\u2019ve increased our annual pre-tax gross cost savings target from approximately $300 million to $400 million to a new range of $400 million to $500 million. ","We expect these savings will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021 and we\u2019ve made solid progress in fiscal 2019, and we\u2019re tracking in line with our expectations.","Moving now to below the line. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $185 million, which reflects share repurchases completed in fiscal 2019 and the benefit of share repurchases anticipated in fiscal 2020. We anticipate revenues and results of operations to be currency neutral. ","Concerning the cash flow, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses between $500 million and $700 million. The free cash flow expectation reflects the favorable timing realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with the results of our fiscal fourth quarter performance and the execution against our strategic priorities. While the external environment presents many headwinds, we\u2019re making important progress. Our efforts to drive productivity, execute on initiatives to deliver savings to fund investments for growth, simplify our organization structure and increased accountability are all aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value for our shareholders. We know we have more work to do, yet we are pleased with the progress. We look to build on the momentum of our third and fourth quarter operating performance and remain confident in our business as we enter fiscal 2020.","With that Brian and I would be happy to take your questions. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just to start on the U.S. Pharma business around guidance and specifically around branded inflation, was wondering if you guys be willing to share what the assumption around inflation is that is assumed in guidance? And then more importantly, I was hoping you could provide us an update on how you feel generally around the branded portfolio and renegotiations with branded manufacturers, you have Britt both on the fee-for-service side as you mentioned, but also on that 5% that\u2019s still contingent upon inflation.","Britt Vitalone","Well, good morning Bob. And thanks for that question. Let me see if I can answer those in order. In terms of our guidance for the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, as I mentioned, our assumption around branded price inflation is mid-single digit. And that\u2019s really in line with what we\u2019ve been experiencing here in our fourth quarter and it\u2019s really aligned with fiscal 2019. Our conversations with our manufacturing partners continue to be very productive, we have conversations with our manufacturing partners on a regular basis, we feel like we\u2019re very well-positioned in those conversations.","And there\u2019s nothing in our conversations today that would suggest anything different from the guidance that I provided you. As it relates to the contingent portion, again, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything new here. We continue to have really constructive conversations with our manufacturing partners and we\u2019re really feeling like that fiscal 2020 sets up pretty similar to fiscal 2019.","Robert Jones","Great. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you guys highlighted corporate expense obviously taking a step up, it sounds like in large part because of the ramping opioid litigation. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the visibility you have into what those expenses will be specifically in 2020? And as we think about where we stand in the timelines of some of those larger cases, it seems like, some of them, the bigger ones are poised to go to trial in 2020 and obviously could be in expense for some time beyond that. Any sense you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about the run rate around these costs as we move, not just in 2020 but beyond 2020?","Britt Vitalone","Yes, well thanks for that question. Let me start and then I\u2019ll have Brian add some commentary here. As we were going through last year, we provided you the best guidance that we had for fiscal 2019 and we talked about opioid related costs being in excess of $100 million for FY2019. As we said, our guide, again, what we\u2019re doing is giving you the best visibility that we have to those costs. I outlined that as $150 million for FY2020. It\u2019s very difficult to forecast these out, these really are dependent on the speed of the trials, the decisions that the judges make along these cases and it\u2019s hard for us to predict that. And so what we\u2019ve done here is given you our FY2020 view as we sit here today on how we think those trials might progress and what we think those costs might be to defend in those litigation proceedings.","Brian Tyler","Alright, I think, you covered it well Britt. It is difficult to forecast exactly. It\u2019s the little bit of art and a little bit of science obviously. We\u2019re prepared to make the investment we need to make to prepare a proper defense and protect our shareholders\u2019 interests. As information unfolds and judges decisions and schedules and proceedings occur, we\u2019ll be committed to keep this group updated. I would say in general, I think, if you look at the operating expense environment and discipline in the core operations, I\u2019m very pleased with the trajectory and the progress that we\u2019re making. It is being offset by investments in opioid defense and some very specific targeted investments we\u2019re making into the business as part of our strategic growth initiatives.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks for that.","Brian Tyler","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher ","Thank you. Last year we were talking about a lot of unique headwinds and seen significant that CVS is not considered a unique headwind. Brian, I\u2019d be interested in your perspective on what makes for unique or not and whether there is any change to the scope of that relationship. And Britt, it would be helpful if you have any commentary on the cadence of earnings given some of the renewals, and onetimers and acquisitions that are contributing.","Britt Vitalone","Well Eric good morning and thank you for the question. Obviously we\u2019re very pleased to be able to announce the renewal of our CVS agreement this morning. It\u2019s a long time partnership that we\u2019ve enjoyed with them. I would say that I don\u2019t characterize this renewal as really any different than many of the others I\u2019ve been through with CVS, in the years. These are big business relationships, complicated business relationships. And we worked through those discussions in a way that obviously we reached the feeling that it was mutually beneficial for us to continue to go forward. And so we\u2019re really excited about our partnership with CVS and the economics of that renewal as always have been built into the numbers we shared with you this morning.","Brian Tyler","Eric maybe I\u2019ll just answer your second question here. As we think about the progression of earnings over the course of the year we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but what I would say to you is that as we look at the year, you should expect that our earnings will be roughly the same first half to second half is what we experienced in FY\u201919.","Eric Percher ","Thank you for the detail.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson on for Ross. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations on Europe in the coming year? I know, obviously there are a couple of onetime items there, things that are unavoidable in FY\u201919. But sort of what gives you confidence in the profit growth trajectory for fiscal 2020?","Brian Tyler","Thank you, Elizabeth. Well, we obviously did take a charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter in the UK. But I would say if you step back and look at Europe overall, we were really in line with our growth expectations in most of the countries. And we\u2019re pleased with the performance. We feel like with the headwinds we\u2019ve experienced over the past years in the UK and the management actions that we\u2019ve taken, which includes really, building a new leadership team there, a rationalizing our store portfolio, restructuring the operations, is the work we\u2019ve done that gives us, gives us confidence to feel that we can, you know, get Europe back to very modest growth next year.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect, that\u2019s really helpful. And I also wanted to ask you a question in terms of the upside in your cost cutting program, are there any particular areas that you\u2019re seeing additional dollars coming from or any other color you could provide there would be very helpful?","Britt Vitalone","Yes, thanks for that question. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, there are several areas that we were really focused on as we think about not only cost cuts and spending behaviors and disciplines themselves, but also we\u2019re going through some operating model optimization efforts in our finance operations, in legal HR and our technology and we\u2019ve also talked about investments that we\u2019re making in technology, and data and analytics. ","We\u2019ve also talked about some things in our finance operating model like the partnership with Genpact as we\u2019ve expanded that. So I wouldn\u2019t think of it just as cost cutting. Spend discipline is important, it\u2019s important component to that. But we\u2019re also going through some operating model optimization capabilities and we\u2019ve made some really great progress, particularly in the areas of technology and in finance. In the area of technology, we\u2019re in a position now to reinvest back into that, invest in infrastructure and also invest in data and analytics capabilities.","Elizabeth Anderson","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks. I want to get back to the U.S. Pharma business and your guidance there. It assumes, if I\u2019m thinking about this right, I think, it assumes margins to be pretty flattish year-over-year. And I understand there\u2019s some synergies from M&A and some other improvements and growth in specialty and the like. If you can breakdown sort of what your expectations are for generic profitability and the spreads there, like what have you been seeing versus maybe margins and some of the other segments within U.S. Pharma?","Britt Vitalone","Thanks for that question, Kevin. I\u2019ll start and what I would say to you as a starting point is we\u2019re pleased to be able to provide an outlook for our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment which returns to growth next year. And I think that\u2019s on multiple dimensions. We\u2019ve certainly made some advances in our specialty business and continue to see good growth there. As we talked about, we\u2019re seeing relative stability in the manufactured price increase area of our business. And as it relates to generics, we don\u2019t provide specific guidance on inflation or deflation rates.","What I would tell you though is that we are very comfortable with the sourcing capabilities that we have through ClarusONE and continue to drive good value out of that. And on the sell side, we have great compliance with our customers. We utilize our capability and scale from ClarusONE to provide really good value to our customers. And we believe that we\u2019re continuing to create an appropriate spread, which is in a market that is competitive yet stable.","And so we\u2019re very comfortable operating in that environment. And overall, that leads us to be able to provide you an outlook for the segment that has low-to-mid single-digit growth in 2020.","Kevin Caliendo","And just one quick follow-up, speaking of outlook, it feels to me like this guidance is a little bit narrower than we\u2019ve seen recently, especially given the higher number. What would cause guidance to come in at the high end of range versus low end of range, given what you\u2019ve provided us so far? What\u2019s $13.85 versus $14.25, like what needs to happen?","Britt Vitalone","First of all \u2013 yes, thank you, Kevin. First all it is narrower than the guidance that we provided last year. We have certainly put together plans and constructed these plans with a lot of really good information and visibility into our business units. I think as you think about the top end of the range, certainly continued growth in our Specialty business would propel us there. We\u2019ve had very strong growth in our Medical-Surgical business, continuing to grow patient home delivery and the investments we\u2019ve made there, we call those out. We think that those are going to deliver some upside in 2020 and beyond. And our ongoing cost management efforts will take hold as we get further into the period to FY2021.","On the downside, I think, things that could happen could be the outcome of U.S. drug pricing reform or additional regulatory impacts in our international market, which, again, we called out, we are not contemplating those, but those are things that could happen that drive us to the lower end of that range.","Kevin Caliendo","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Brian, you talked before about the CVS renewal and how \u2013 wasn\u2019t that different from previous one. That being said, you\u2019ve recently renewed three of your largest customers, CVS, Rite Aid, VA against the backdrop of some of these drug pricing dynamics. You\u2019ve also talked about your engagement with brand inflation manufacturers. How do you think about the conversations that you went into them and thinking about the trade off of services, versus price, versus volume commitments in this new drug pricing world? And was there anything that given the moving piece on drug pricing you are able to essentially pivot the conversation on.","Brian Tyler","Thanks for the question, Michael. Obviously, as we enter these discussions, we are well aware and informed of the regulatory environment as frankly were our customers. And as we have been evolving our model over the past years to think about how we think of different product, classes and the services we provide around those classes and the economics we get with those classes, that kind of all goes into the mix, and is the context in the backdrop for these conversations.","As we think about the gross to net environment and things of that nature, I would remind folks that there is a little bit of a natural hedge on the buy and the sell side for us. But at least these are all well considered and well contemplated, frankly, on both sides as we entered into these agreements and we have baked the results of these renewals into the guide that we\u2019ve reviewed to you this morning. And we\u2019re very comfortable in the relationships and excited to extend our business partnership with both Rite Aid and CVS.","Michael Cherny","And then just one quick one relative to the share count guidance, it looks like if my math is correct, you are assuming a higher degree of buyback versus previous years of guidance. Does that have anything to do with your outlook on potential M&A targets relative to where you sit on a portfolio basis or the viability of what you see across the market?","Britt Vitalone","Well, again, I would just point to, as I mentioned, our share count assumption is 185 million at the end of FY2020. As Brian talked about and we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we look at our capital deployment on a balanced perspective and trying to drive the most value for our shareholders. And as we think about FY2020, we think that capital deployment towards share repurchases is still an important component of that. And we believe that our share price is undervalued at this point, so that certainly is going to be a component of how we think about capital deployment.","Brian Tyler","I would just add, I don\u2019t think the message should be that we don\u2019t see good M&A opportunities, or good growth opportunities for this Company. We have had a good track record. And some of our recent deals, I think, have been highly successful for us. But what we are doing is really being very focused on where that M&A might occur and making sure it\u2019s aligned with our strategic growth initiative and the three growth pillars that we have aligned. And we make those decisions, obviously, in the context of where our share price is today and what we think the relative attractiveness of share buybacks versus M&A are.","So we do have good opportunities. We are and will continue to be active in looking for growth or capabilities that might come to us through M&A, but doing that in a very disciplined way.","Britt Vitalone","I think MSD is a good example of that that we completed in FY2019.","Michael Cherny","Great, thanks for the color.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Stephen Baxter","Hi, thanks for the question. I was hoping to get some additional insight into the [indiscernible] of the efficiency program. And can you help us understand how much of the cost savings was achieved in 2019? How much incremental you think happens in fiscal 2020? And then how much of that remains to benefit the numbers in 2021 and 2022? Thank you.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, thanks for that question. What we have told you is that we expect to have $400 million to $500 million of cost savings by the end of FY2021 full year. Comfortable raising that target given the actions that we\u2019ve taken here in the last quarter, we haven\u2019t provided specific year-to-year guidance on that. What I have said is that in FY2019 the savings that we generated were largely invested back in the business. We talked about our information technology infrastructure, and data and analytics capabilities. So you should view FY2019 as largely reinvested back in the business.","As we progress through the time period over FY2020 and now FY2021, we would expect that those savings will increase over time and then you should expect to see more and more of those hit the bottom line, but we haven\u2019t provided specific year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter guidance on the numbers.","Stephen Baxter","Okay, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, I think, in the past you said of the cumulative program, most of it will drop through. Is there any update to that or is that still kind of the right way to think about it?","Britt Vitalone","That\u2019s the right way to think about it.","Brian Tyler","And I think about it that we\u2019re in the early phases of our efficiency initiatives are producing, we\u2019re making a calculated decision in some instances to invest that back into the business. As those efficiency efforts continue to grow, the investments will begin to wane off, you\u2019ll see a bigger impact.","Stephen Baxter","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question regarding sort of the rebate rule and sort of the role you see the distributors play. And then if I\u2019m not mistaken, in some of the comments that the wholesalers have provided to GCMS here is sort of applying sort of a chargeback system that you have had in place with manufacturers for pharmacies to apply for \u2013 to apply this for the administration of point-of-sale rebates? Can you talk about sort of the capabilities that you currently have to do that today? How that it works for pharmacies and how quickly could that be applied for the use for consumers directly? Thanks.","Brian Tyler","Thanks for the question, Charles. So first off, I would remind everybody that the Part D safe harbor does not really impact our business model directly. We are not contemplated in that. So what we\u2019re really talking about in the course of that reform is what are the implications for retailers and manufacturers, and then how might that ultimately impact us. We do think that we have some scaled and significant capabilities to help address the solution for this area. That would be not just the wholesaler chargeback infrastructure and technology, which really operates at big scale and highly efficient today, but also through our relay switch business.","We are transacting 18 billion, 19 billion transactions at the pharmacy desktop each and every day \u2013 well, not each and every day, each and every year as we speak. And so while each one of those solutions by itself is probably not what\u2019s going to be required to administer whatever comes out, and we think it will actually come out pretty soon in terms of a final rule. We think the underlying capabilities will be there. And so what we\u2019re really looking for in the rule is what does HHS, say, relative to transparency? What are they going to stipulate in terms of the service providers that can support this?","And frankly, what is the time frame for the implementation? And contemplating all those things, we will look at how we bring our capabilities which are unique to us, not all of them. We all have the chargeback capability but relay switch business is a little bit unique to McKesson. And if the opportunity is there for us to play a differentiated role or be part of the solution, that\u2019s something that we would certainly, look to do. But we\u2019ll also approach it with the seriousness that these are massively scaled transactions with big financial implications for all party and so anything that we would roll out would have to be robust, tested and reliable.","Charles Rhyee","And just a follow-up, I think one concern is particularly as you think about the application of point-of-sale discounts, this potential that particularly like pharmacies or independent pharmacies could be sort of caught on the wrong end carrying sort of a negative float here until sort of a true up on payments. Is that something where you see distributors potentially playing a role kind of supporting pharmacy customers using a balance sheet to sort of help them on the working capital side? Thanks.","Brian Tyler","Yes, really that\u2019s a good question, and that\u2019s one that we\u2019re probably not prepared to answer right now until we see what the final rule looks like. I mean, I will say that we have long been an important part of supporting the independent customer base with a really broad array of solutions from helping on the reimbursement side of the business, helping with the cost, the reporting, obviously, generic procurement programs.","And as this rolls out and we see what the impact and evolutions are, we\u2019ll assess our capabilities whether they support the services, our balance sheet, figure out how to best support the independent and retail community pharmacy space. But it would be premature to make any definitive statements.","Charles Rhyee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt. Thanks for taking the question. Just to come back for a minute here on the cost savings and the segment reporting. And just kind of thinking out loud for the $400 million to $500 million in cost savings, we\u2019re assuming most of that does show up in the operating profit segment results for U.S. pharma solutions and European pharma solutions, but just curious if any material amount of the savings would show up in the corporate expense line over the next couple of years even though corporate expenses are obviously going up a lot in fiscal 2020.","So it does seem like as you described some of the sources of savings, it does seem like some of that would fit into a corporate expense buckets. So just curious if there are some savings factored into that guidance in corporate expense for fiscal 2020. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks, Steve, for that question. It\u2019s great question, let me just clarify that. The cost savings programs that we put in place, which include the optimization of our operating models, are enterprise wide. So as we think about cost savings, it\u2019s really disciplined on an enterprise basis which would include our corporate functions. As we think about our operating model optimization efforts, whether that\u2019d be in finance, or technology or HR, clearly those will be enterprise wide as well. So as we think about, these are really holistic programs where we expect the benefits to have an impact not only within the segments, but also within our corporate expense line as well.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. One other quick one here just on the guidance. Normally, you guys will give some comments on contribution from new generic launches and I didn\u2019t hear much about that for FY2020. [Indiscernible] have launched recently generic Advair and a few others, but just big picture, any view on profits from new generic launches FY2020 versus FY2019.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks for that question. Clearly there will be generic launches in every year. I think as we think about this, we don\u2019t expect a material profit difference in FY2020 than FY2019 from generic launches. So there will be, what we would expect to be, a modest impact from generic launches in FY2020.","Steven Valiquette","Got it. Okay, thanks.","Brian Tyler","Thank you.","Holly Weiss","Operator, we have time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from David Larsen with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","David Larsen","Hi. It looks like you are guiding pretty good operating profit growth for fiscal 2020 across all segments with the exception of other. Can you just remind me what is going on in other that is going to basically cause the entire enterprise\u2019s operating income, it looks like to decline possibly to low-single digits in fiscal 2020. Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Thanks for the question. As I talked about in my remarks, in fiscal 2019 in our other segment we had the benefit from the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability within our Change Healthcare business. And so that, obviously, we will be lapping that in fiscal 2020, that is the primary change. And that is really partially offsetting some good growth and some good expansion that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in our MRxTS business.","David Larsen","Okay. And then with the opioid litigation costs, I mean, some of the numbers we\u2019re hearing from these litigator are very, very high. Like, would you expect to include those cost of litigation in your adjusted EPS going forward beyond fiscal 2020 or would you view those as one-time items? Thanks.","Britt Vitalone","Yes, thanks for that question. What I would be prepared to say now is our guidance assumes the litigation costs and that number is $150 million. We don\u2019t have any visibility into anything beyond that. So it would be inappropriate for us to really comment on it at this time. As things come up, or there are decisions that are being made, we\u2019ll certainly provide that guidance and visibility to you. But as it relates to our guidance today, it\u2019s the $150 million in opioid-related litigation costs, which are in our corporate segment.","David Larsen","Okay and then just the last one from me. You had $23 million of operating income in European Pharma Solutions this quarter. I mean, it looks like we\u2019re expecting a pretty big rebound in fiscal 2020. Just, what\u2019s going to drive that? And I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks a lot.","Britt Vitalone","I would just remind you that we took a charge in the fourth quarter related to that business and we\u2019ve also been hard at work in terms of optimizing our store portfolio, rationalizing our back office support functions and we think all of those will begin to yield benefit.","David Larsen","Okay. Congrats on a good fiscal 2019, Britt.","Britt Vitalone","Thank you.","Brian Tyler","Thank you, David. And thank you, operator. Unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time. So I want to thank all of you who joined us on the call this morning, particularly those with questions. And we appreciate your support and interest in McKesson. We have a clear strategy and a solid operating plan for fiscal 2020 and exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I remain confident in our future.","Thanks again for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll now hand the call to Holly for her review of upcoming events for the financial community.","Holly Weiss","Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas on May 14, and we will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 11. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"14239":["McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) Q2 2018 Earnings Call October 26, 2017  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","John H.

Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time.","Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.","Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance across our business as we make continued progress towards a strong finish to our fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.28, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share.","Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon today's announcement that Paul Julian will be retiring at the end of the calendar year. I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Paul over the past two decades. Paul's business acumen and strategic leadership have helped us expand our market reach as well as the breadth of services and solutions we offer to our customers. His dedication and tireless commitment to our people, our customers and the industry set him apart.","Starting in McKesson Health Systems, the company's distribution business for hospitals, he led many of the businesses that now comprise our Distribution Solutions segment. Paul has had a four decade career in healthcare. He has received numerous awards and throughout his career have been recognized for his many contributions. He has demonstrated exceptional character, accomplishment and leadership in the industry and in the community. I worked closely with Paul for many years and he is my friend as well as a close colleague. His perspective and insights are critical to the growth and success of McKesson, including building a deep bench of talented leaders to carry McKesson into the future. On Paul's retirement, the presidents of these businesses within Distribution Solutions will report to me. I will miss working with Paul and wish him the very best in this new chapter of his life.","Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis.","I'd like to discuss a few highlights in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We are recognized as a leader in delivering novel solutions to the market. We find innovative ways to expand our value proposition across the entire supply chain. For example, AccessHealth continues to successfully partner with independent pharmacies, enabling improved financial performance and broadening access to narrow patient\/payer networks.","We also recently closed the BDI Pharma acquisition. This business complements our existing plasma offerings and allows us to expand plasma and biologic distribution into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise.","And ClarusONE, which is performing in line with our plan, leverages our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities. These examples demonstrate our ongoing strategy to build scale, expand our pharmaceutical offerings, enhance our manufacturer value proposition, and enable our customers' continued success.","Next, we're pleased with the progress of our multiyear initiative to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes as we work through our contract renewal cycles.","Finally, Walgreens' asset purchase of a number of Rite Aid stores was approved by the FTC last month. Based on Walgreens' public statements that they began last week to transition stores and will carry through the spring of 2018, we expect to be impacted in our fourth quarter as stores progressively migrate to Walgreens over the transition period.","We've been having constructive dialog with Rite Aid on how we can continue to support their success, during the transition period and beyond to the mutual benefit of both parties. And as I've mentioned in the past, Rite Aid has only a modest impact on our P&L. We are comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability will not be impacted by this transition.","Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, with the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition earlier this quarter, along with the BDI Pharma acquisition I spoke about a moment ago, I'd like to highlight how we continue to enhance our specialty capabilities across the organization. We provide manufacturers with an integrated solution set starting from clinical research and development to drug launch and distribution services, and from patient reimbursement and access solutions to real world evidence-based capabilities. Biologics and biosimilars continue to represent an emerging opportunity for the industry. We are proud to be a leader, supporting clinical trials for these and other innovative new therapies for many years.","And I'm excited about the opportunity that CoverMyMeds provides across our businesses with the e-Referral platform for specialty prescriptions, connecting providers with specialty pharmacies and payers and improving care coordination and care management for complex health conditions.","I'll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw a nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations. During the quarter, McKesson Canada closed the Uniprix banner acquisition, where we will continue to offer Uniprix owners retail banner management expertise and best-in-class supply chain network, designed to ensure patient safety and reduced costs. All of these services help strengthen independent pharmacies. Uniprix integration activities are progressing well as are those supporting the GMD Distribution acquisition.","And our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business continues to make progress on the CoverMyMeds integration. We are encouraged by the level of collaboration we are already seeing between CoverMyMeds and our other businesses.","Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services, on our last earnings call, we mentioned that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historic levels and also greater than what we planned for in fiscal 2018. After studying the nature of the cuts, we decided it was necessary to take action to position the business for sustained long-term growth by initiating a plan to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations.","As a result, we recorded certain charges within our UK retail operations. James will provide more detail on these items. We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting. And we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing the range of healthcare services.","And finally, our Medical-Surgical business continues to deliver consistent results, benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. In summary, I was pleased with how with our Distribution Solutions segment performed in the quarter.","Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment, we reached another milestone on October 2 with the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS business. This represents another important step in the strategic shift to realign our business focus on Distribution Solutions, following the creation of Change Healthcare earlier this calendar year, is a testament to the team at EIS when we consider the results they achieved for the first half of the year, given the uncertainties around the extended strategic review process that is now complete. In addition, I have confidence that EIS customers have a partner committed to their success. And for Change Healthcare, we continue to see encouraging progress against the execution of the business case and the realization of the anticipated cost synergies.","And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across the enterprise, and we are reiterating our adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share for our full year fiscal 2018 outlook. We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.","Before I hand the call over to James, I'd like to spend a moment on a topic of national importance, the opioid epidemic. This is a crisis that has touched many Americans, and including many Americans that live here at McKesson and are part of our family. McKesson takes our role in the supply chain very seriously. We've invested considerable time and resources to help stop diversion at a time when diversion tactics are constantly changing. We've implemented sophisticated analytic tools, hired experienced diversion investigators, and enhanced the effectiveness of our controlled substance monitoring program. We work collaboratively with the DEA to better understand diversion trends. This working relationship is critical, since the DEA has singular line of sight into the total volume of opioids sold to any licensed pharmacy or hospital.","The trends in this crisis continue to evolve, and we are regularly enhancing our programs to further limit the misuse and abuse of prescription opioids while simultaneously protecting the availability of the appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries. But our company's, and our industry's, commitment to public health and safety was recently called into question by certain media outlets. Those outlets sought to place blame for the tragic opioid epidemic on distributors and elected officials who, with bipartisan Congressional support and after consultation and input from the DEA and the Department of Justice, enacted a clarifying enforcement bill that was signed into law.","As recent Congressional testimony indicated, since the passage of the law, the quantity of opioids distributed has decreased, and the number of enforcement actions by the DEA has increased. Many press articles have since corrected the misinformation that resulted from those earlier media stories and subsequently, there has also been more attention put on the need to control the annual production of opioids, on the illicit opioids entering our country from other sources, and on the critical role of healthcare professionals who are at the frontlines in dealing with patients and ensuring that only patients with legitimate medical needs receive the appropriate amount of these medications.","McKesson is also committed to helping promote forward-looking solutions to this public health problem. That's why over a year ago, we convened a taskforce of policy and clinical experts to help create a public policy white paper, which outlined a set of proposals to help combat the epidemic going forward.","These proposals include changing the medical community's approach to prescribing opioids, requiring e-prescribing to avoid modification or manipulation of the prescription. It created a national patient safety network that provides real-time patient information to pharmacists while they're directly interacting with the patients seeking these drugs.","We look forward to continuing to work with all parties; federal, state and local governments, manufacturers, insurance companies, pharmacies, and the medical profession, to implement practical and effective solutions.","And last, let me touch upon the tragedies that recently unfolded across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided material impacts to our operations or to our facilities from the devastation resulting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the recent fires across Northern California. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas.","Our employees in the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced coworkers and other residents, contributing more than $700,000 in relief efforts. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected employees, customers, and communities.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.28, which was slightly better than our previous expectations, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share.","Unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release, and on our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, are being reiterated today. I will talk in more detail about our outlook, but first let's review our results fourth quarter.","GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations equated to $0.01 for the second quarter. These earnings include impairment and restructuring charges of $2.60 per diluted share related to our retail pharmacy business in the UK.","As we discussed on our last earnings call in July, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts, which were incremental to their more typical annual reimbursement reductions and to those assumed in our plan. Primarily as a result of these cuts, we have identified and started to implement initiatives to partially offset the impact of these cuts, which include approximately 190 store closures and divestitures.","The resulting savings from this program are expected to more meaningfully benefit our fiscal 2019 performance. The program's total asset impairment and restructuring charges are expected to be between $650 million and $750 million.","Specific to the second quarter, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment and restructuring pre-tax charges totaling $586 million. As a reminder, these charges will impact our GAAP financial results. However, they will be excluded from adjusted earnings.","Now let's turn to our second quarter adjusted earnings, which exclude the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was up 2% in constant currency from a year ago, and second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 6% in constant currency year-over-year. Adjusted other income was $27 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $75 million for the second quarter.","We are encouraged by the progress of Change Healthcare and continue to expect our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Interest expense of $69 million decreased 12% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 23.6% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business.","Our full year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 24%, down from our previous estimate of 25%, reflecting our mix of business.","Our income attributable to non-controlling interest, or NCI, was $55 million for the quarter, an increase of 218% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, a joint sourcing entity with Walmart. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to be between $210 million and $230 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting ClarusONE's ongoing success at sourcing generics at prices lower than we originally expected.","Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $689 million with our second quarter adjusted EPS at $3.28 per diluted share, up 11% compared to $2.96 in the prior year. Our second quarter EPS growth was driven by organic growth across multiple business units, including ClarusONE, a lower share count and incremental profit contribution from acquisitions, which more than offset the year-over-year lapping effect of increased price competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 210 million, down 8% compared to the prior-year period.","Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $51.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Reported revenues benefited from $344 million in favorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand-to-generic conversions.","International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.8 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 4%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Reported revenues benefited from $237 million in favorable currency rate movements.","As a reminder, our previous full year assumption was that foreign currency exchange rate movements would have a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. During the quarter, foreign currency rates trended favorably versus our original assumptions. As a result, we now expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year.","Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the second quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 15% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions, organic growth across multiple business units, including strategic sourcing benefits from ClarusONE and increased branded compensation, more than offsetting the planned year-over-year lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business.","As we discussed previously, following the close of the second quarter, we have now fully lapped the impact of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the sell-side pricing environment continues to remain competitive with less pricing variability.","Now, let me turn to branded compensation and branded pharmaceutical price increases. As noted on our first quarter earnings call, based on our previously discussed differential pricing effort, we renewed contracts with two large branded manufacturers during the first quarter. These renewals drove lower compensation in the first quarter and a resulting step-up in compensation in the second quarter.","Additionally, in the second quarter, we also benefited from a pull forward of certain branded compensation that we had expected in the third quarter. That said, our expectations for the full year contribution from branded compensation remain unchanged. I'd like to remind everyone, however, as is typical based on our historical experience, that the majority of manufacturer pricing activity is expected to occur in our fiscal fourth quarter.","Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions and the increased mix of retail business in the segment, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts.","Going forward, we expect our full year adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue to be at levels roughly consistent with the first half of this year. As we diversify our Distribution Solutions businesses, our adjusted gross profit margin rate benefits from our recent retail pharmacy and technology acquisitions. Similarly, these acquisitions are increasing our adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue.","Now, to our adjusted operating profit. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was up 12% in constant currency year-over-year, at $1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 201 basis points on a constant currency basis, an increase of 13 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, partially offset by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. As a result of this revenue mix and the pressures on our UK business, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin rate to be at the lower half of our previously guided range of 198 basis points to 208 basis points.","Now, moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018, MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business, or EIS.","Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $60 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare, was $17 million.","Additionally, following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of our EIS business. As a result, there will be no contribution from this business in the second half of fiscal 2018. As a result, going forward, MTS operating profit will represent only the equity contribution from Change Healthcare.","I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory increased 2 day from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased 2 days from the prior year to 61 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion with approximately $1.9 billion held offshore. And in the first six months of fiscal 2018, McKesson generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations.","We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, we spent $255 million on internal capital investments and repaid $545 million in the long-term debt. In the second quarter, we repurchased $400 million in common stock. The FY 2018 EPS impact of this buyback approximately offsets the loss of EIS' earnings in the back half of this fiscal year. Share repurchases during the first six months of fiscal 2018 now totaled $650 million. And we now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 211 million for the full year, reflecting share repurchases completed in fiscal 2018.","We have approximately $2.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We spent $1.9 billion on acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal 2018, which includes the second quarter acquisitions of intraFUSION, BDI Pharma and Uniprix, all of which we discussed at Investor Day. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34.","Now, let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. Our original guidance range assumed a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. We also noted that should Rite Aid be acquired by Walgreens, we would expect a material one-time cash flow impact driven by the favorable working capital terms associated with our generics business.","In September, Walgreens announced it had received regulatory clearance to purchase approximately 40% of Rite Aid stores and that some store transitions would begin this month and all impacted stores would be a part of Walgreens operations by the spring of 2018.","We will keep you updated on the earnings and cash flow impact of the eventual store transition program during the next two quarters. While our relationship with Rite Aid will be smaller going forward, the performance of ClarusONE continues to illustrate the competitiveness of our global sourcing scale and operations.","Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. We are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. This reiterated range includes the earnings headwinds of the recently completed sale of our EIS business, an estimate of the effect of the Rite Aid store transition and our projection of the challenges expected in the UK during the remainder of FY 2018.","Offsetting these headwinds, our guidance range benefits from share repurchases completed in the second quarter, the anticipated favorability to results driven by foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the new estimated adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. The various items that I've just mentioned largely offset one another, resulting in our reiteration of the previously-guided range.","Each year, as we develop our annual plan, we contemplate a range of possible outcomes. Based on our performance year-to-date, I continue to be comfortable with the midpoint represented by our full year guide. As for our quarterly progression, let me remind you of my earlier comments regarding the pull forward of branded compensation that we had originally expected in the third quarter. And, as in most previous years, we expect our fourth quarter to be our largest in terms of EPS contribution in the fiscal year.","In closing, our second quarter results were somewhat ahead of our expectations, driven by timing. And I'm pleased to be able to reiterate our full year guide in the face of the sale of EIS, the transition of the Rite Aid stores, and the UK headwinds.","And as a reminder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share excludes the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.90 to $1.10 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.20 to credits of $0.10 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.10 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.10 to $1.40 per diluted share, and other net charges of $1.40 to $1.60 per diluted share.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate.","Jessica?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And we'll first go to Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. James, lot of moving parts, but wanted to make sure I understood what was factored into the full year guidance today versus the previous update. So just, is it correct to assume that guidance now contemplates roughly an additional $30 million from additional UK reimbursement cuts that weren't in the previous guidance? And then, with the EIS divestiture or sale intra-quarter, is that about $35 million that you're absorbing into the full year range that's unchanged? Are those the two biggest new things that we should be thinking about in the full year guidance range?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, in terms of the three headwinds UK, EIS, and Rite Aid, so in the UK, I would say the figure is higher than what you were mentioning there. So, we'll update you as time goes by. With EIS, as I mentioned, feel as though the EPS impact in FY 2018 of the buyback roughly offsets what we would have benefited from EIS in our back half of the year. And for Rite Aid, you can think about the original guide that we put out of $0.20 to $0.40, effectively, we're going to have about a 10% effect of that in the balance of the fiscal year. So, hopefully that helps give you a little bit of direction around that.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, it does. I guess just ultimately trying to get a better sense that, there really was not a change to the core drug distribution outlook then, as we think about the previous update relative to this update? Is that a fair statement?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","That's right, because, again, the three items, the UK, the EIS, and Rite Aid, obviously, two of those are embedded within the Distribution Solutions business. Those are, in essence, being offset by share count, tax rate, and FX assumptions.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just, John, a quick follow-up, two significant management departures announced this week. Can you talk about the process, as you think about backfilling, big shoes to fill, with Paul and Mark's departures announced this week?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Sure. As you might expect, the management team and the board have a very rigorous process of, not only talent development and talent review and sort of talent planning, but also a lot of work is done, particularly at the higher levels, in terms of succession planning. So yeah, Paul and I have worked together for an awfully long time, and one of the priorities we've had together for that entire tenure together has been the development of a very strong bench.","We announced very quickly a replacement for Mark Walchirk upon his departure, and we're really pleased at, not only the contribution he's made to us over his career, but the fact that he landed in an important job, and it shows that McKesson executives are sought after and that they're well-trained and that they can take on big responsibilities. So, I think that's the good part of that news for him certainly, and we're excited that we are able to replace him, in the new combined responsibility for both our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our Specialty business, with Nick Loporcaro. You probably met Nick on occasion on our Investor Days. Nick runs our Specialty business now, and will also have the combined responsibility for our U.S. Pharmaceutical business.","And frankly, I think Nick is very well-suited for this job. He ran all of our Canadian distribution and operations businesses in Canada. He knows retail pharmacy well. He knows hospital pharmacy. He knows independence and chains. He understands the manufacturing environment. He certainly understands what we think is a significant going-forward opportunity in Specialty. So, we're excited about his leadership and what he can do for us. And as I said, it's not as if Paul was going to be here forever and we've been always thinking about how are we going to make sure that we're well positioned in the event that he decides to pursue retirement. So, I'm excited for Paul, excited for Mark and especially excited for Nick.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And we'll now go to Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the cadence in the guidance. So James, is there any \u2013 you talked about the pull forward \u2013 I'm sorry, the step up in 2Q from the manufacturer contracts. Are there any kind of step-downs in the back half of the year that we should be aware of?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I would say, as you think about the progression of Q3 and Q4 and the relative contribution of those quarter to the full year, I would see Q4 generating a number of percentage points more than Q3 will. And, indeed, I commented on that, that trend pull forward into Q2 from Q3. So, I think that, hopefully, helps a little bit on the sequencing of the quarter.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That does. And then, John, you talked about moving into differential pricing. Can you comment on the progress that you've seen so far? And particularly, are you seeing any kind of pushback from clients, maybe from some of your larger ones? And maybe can you help characterize what those discussions look like? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the question, Charles. We have been in a consistent process with our renewals of our agreements with our customers and I think we've been quite successful. Our customer base understands that the pricing that we used 20 years ago, which were basically a brand and generic and even mostly brand if you go back that far, just doesn't work in today's environment. And having a more specific approach to pricing categories of products that are more similar to one another, we think, is better for us and, frankly, better for them as well. You're not mixing discounts between different types of products and different revenue and margin characteristics, and this provides better clarity for both of us. So, I think we've been almost universally successful in getting this accomplished, and we feel confident we will continue to do so as we finish this contract renewal cycle over the next several years.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now move to George Hill from RBC.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, and if Paul is listening, I want to wish him well, John, because I know he served you a long time. I guess, James, I would ask, is there any chance that you can quantify kind of the impact of ClarusONE and the brand drug pull forward in the quarter? And should we think of the brand drug impact is not repeatable in Q3, but ClarusONE should be a more sustainable contribution? Like, I'm just trying to make sure I have a good understanding of the cadence of the balance of the year.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah in terms of the branded compensation, as I mentioned, where \u2013 we do have these timing elements from Q1 to Q2, Q3 into Q2, but for the overall year, we're not expecting a change in the branded comp that we would receive. In terms of ClarusONE and their work around the generics, we've been very pleased with how that has proceeded. I mentioned in my remarks that the NCI line reflects the progress that ClarusONE has been making at sourcing pharmaceutical at lower prices than we had expected at the outset of the year. So, our COGS are benefiting, our Walmart's colleagues COGS are benefiting from the progress that ClarusONE is making.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then maybe my follow-up would just be a little bit nuanced. Is that the \u2013 the outperformance in the quarter, I guess, versus consensus expectations was pretty strong. Should we think of that largely as the timing of the brand contribution verses maybe what the Street might have been expecting for the year?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, that's certainly one driver of it. Obviously, tax rates has come down as well. We've updated our full year guide in that regard. And I did note that Q2's results were slightly ahead of where we had planned to be originally at the start of the year.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. So, two questions. First, John, for you. We're hearing, obviously, a lot of discussion and getting a lot of questions on Amazon. Can you just share with us your thoughts? And also, do you see opportunity for you guys to work together with Amazon if they were to enter the drug supply chain?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks for the question, Ricky. To some extent, we were Amazon before it was cool to be Amazon. Now, if you think about our business model, largely it is an online order relationship. From an order processing perspective, it is very well functioning that has been in place for a long time, next-day delivery and a complete process from a logistics perspective. But it's also supported by field salespeople, return goods management, sometimes private trucking, and certainly things like controlled substance management, billions of dollars of inventory, and very significant back-office operations that reconcile the significant delta in various pricing strategies that are our manufacturer partners, both in medical supplies as well as in pharmaceuticals, rely upon with us in partnership.","So, I would say, in some ways, it's very similar to what Amazon would do maybe logistically. But if you actually think about what's behind the scenes in terms of us taking credit risk, in terms of us processing invoices and processing returns, and then processing pricing on a regular basis, it's quite significant and more nuanced, perhaps, than it would appear on the surface.","Clearly, we are also heavily focused on trying to make sure that our customers have the right tools and capabilities to help them with all of their \u2013 particularly in the independent side with all of their requirements in terms of patient relationships to make it more than just a transaction and make it a healthcare experience supported by a professional pharmacist that really understands the nuances of drug-to-drug interaction, understands what it means to dispense things like opioids and other products, and understands certainly the regulatory framework and the larger clinical issues that may be facing the patients that they're working with everyday.","So, the easiest thing to talk about in the world of wholesaling is the logistics function. But I would say that that's probably the simplest part of our business. And clearly, we try to excel in myriad of other areas that we think differentiate us. Having said all of that, we don't take the entry of any competitor lightly and we continue to evolve our strategy so that our value to both the manufacturer and to our customers is unique and superior.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up question in terms of the guide and the progression. So, you've tightened the range on your LIFO credits. So, what are you seeing in terms of the deflationary environment? How do you think about the progression for the second half of your fiscal year? And then also, how should we think about that in the context of your Distribution operating margin goals for the fiscal year?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, in terms of generic deflation, as we've discussed before, ClarusONE is doing an excellent job. We're purchasing pharmaceuticals at lower prices than we'd expected when we first put the plan together. Now, again, as we've discussed, that equation of optimizing our cost of goods sold is quite separate to the economic equation on the sell side, where I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, suddenly, the environment is still competitive, but with less pricing volatility than we would have been looking at this time last year. In terms of our Distribution Solutions operating margin guide, I felt appropriate to really direct you to the lower half of that original guided range, based on the UK situation that we've been discussing at some length. And then, of course, there'll be some effect on the P&L that will impact the Distribution Solutions operating margin from Rite Aid as well as those stores transition at a yet-to-be-determined rate.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I also want to add my congratulations to Paul on his retirement and we'll definitely miss him, John. First, just trying to reconcile a number of the statements that have been said today. James, you just talked about sell-side pressure continuing being less volatile, you talked about the benefit to COGS on ClarusONE. Is the expectation, as we move throughout the rest of the fiscal year, that you have to share some of that ClarusONE savings back with customers? I'm just trying to understand how do we think about ClarusONE, specifically, as we're thinking about the cadence of the quarter?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think the best way to think about it, as James mentioned a moment ago, is really in two distinct buckets. Our ability to manage our costs across the board are an important aspect of what we do, whether it's a cost of our operations and the productivity improvements we get or whether it's a cost of the goods we purchase, driving those costs down to market levels or below should be our priority, and our focus has always been to buy right and to manage right and to be efficient.","The second priority is to make sure that our customers are getting the deal that they need to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. And largely, that's determined on what the market price is for products. So, we have a completely separate team that decides what we're going to sell products for from what the team is that does the buying of our activity. And we're focused on making sure that we have the right data on both sides of those operations to assure ourselves of market competitiveness, and that's what we're attempting to do and that's where the margin comes from is our ability to manage those operations with, hopefully, solid execution.","So that's the way we think about it. So, the more we overachieve the ClarusONE and the more stable the market can be, then more likely it is for us to get margin expansion over time to grow our business, and that should be our priority for it (50:21) to create value.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, John, you did mention in your prepared comments, talking about the opioid issue in the U.S. and talking about these media reports, over the last several years, the drug distributors have had several settlements around DEA issues, et cetera. Can you maybe just talk about what your anticipation is around opioids? Would you expect that there will be some cash flow impact, we'll see incremental settlements? Or do you think that that's largely behind you at this point and this is more of a regulatory issue rather than the states coming back to the drug distributors looking for some kind of settlement?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, in a larger context, not even speaking necessarily about this particular issue, when you're faced with litigation or litigation risk, you usually find opportunities to try to determine whether or not there's any real risk there or any data that would support the alleged activity or risk that you may be facing. And you trade that off against what would it cost for us to not \u2013 to eliminate that risk, and the associated potential liability of that (51:37) if you're not successful. So, I think all of those decisions are made on their own and probably in isolation from one another.","Are we concerned about opioid and the continued risk and things that are going on in the marketplace? Certainly, but we're probably more focused \u2013 as I tried to mention in my conversation at the beginning here, we're more focused on solutions that we think can make a difference. Frankly, lawsuits from various parties and settlements don't solve the problem. What solves the problem is thinking in a broader context and putting the solutions in place that can actually prevent this from happening.","And when I mentioned physicians at the start of this, it really is related to how they think about the prescriptions they're providing to their patients and the quantities that they're writing in those scripts. Clearly, whether the script is legitimate or not when it shows up at the pharmacy, if we use electronic prescribing, that can make a difference.","And third, if we have information about the patient real-time in the workflow at the pharmacy when they're doing the rest of their adjudication of the claim if they understood that the patient recently had four other scripts filled in the last two weeks from five different pharmacies across state lines, it might give them a little bit of a pause before they yet fill one more script. And that's certainly a portion of the problem and we think those solutions can be easily implemented. We think the technologies are available today and it will make a material impact, certainly on that source of the opioid diversion epidemic challenge.","There's a whole other source. If you watch the news today, they talk about coming over borders. They talk about it being imported from other countries, and online ordering of these kinds of drugs that are packaged in different types of packaging to avoid detection. There's all kinds of sources of these products. And clearly, at the very start of this whole thing is, how do we help prevent people from becoming addicted to these drugs to begin with. So, it is a much larger problem. We're trying to focus on solutions. And some people ask me if this is going to be a tobacco overhang, and I don't think that's what we're going to face as an industry.","Clearly, we have a role to play, but we don't see the patient. We don't prescribe the drugs. We don't dispense the drugs. We don't have all the data on the care, and I don't know how we can be responsible, solely, for this challenge.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I agree. I appreciate your comments.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my call. So, another question on ClarusONE. Looking at the non-controlling interest line, it was sort of flat sequentially and for the year, your guidance implies not a significant amount of growth in that number over the course of the year. I guess my question is, is ClarusONE a growth opportunity sort of going forward, or are we sort of peaking? Is it something that can grow as we get into fiscal 2019?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think when we talk about ClarusONE, it's important to think about the two places on our P&L where it drives the benefit. So, the first place is the cost of goods sold.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","And maybe I can jump in there, because the NCI is really not an indication of ClarusONE's opportunity and its growth. It is an accounting-related matter that James will address here in just a moment. But we see a great opportunity with ClarusONE, frankly. Today, it's focused primarily on generics. And as James mentioned, we actually overachieved our objectives, in terms of the results of our sourcing activity, and it's being reflected in our cost of goods. And obviously, we're pleased with that.","But beyond just generics, and beyond just generics in the U.S., we think ClarusONE can grow. Walmart is very satisfied with what we've done thus far, and our ability to expand into other product categories and other geographies in partnership with Walmart, we think, will be continued opportunities for us to grow the ClarusONE relationship and thus, the impact on ClarusONE's cost of goods into our businesses and other categories. And that may or may not affect the NCI line. The NCI is really an artifact of the current construct of the generic relationships we have and the JV partnership that we have. And it's an output, basically, from that relationship, as opposed to something else will be put into this category, OTCs or something else, may not have an NCI component to them.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","So, think of the cost of goods sold line as the line that receives the primary benefit from the work of ClarusONE, then the NCI line is \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's fee income. So, think of that as the fees earned by ClarusONE, which is a contracting entity, in many ways. And so again, in the text, I mentioned that the future guide for the NCI line is really underpinned by the fact that, as ClarusONE continues to have more success than we originally planned for in its sourcing capabilities, then there'd be a lesser level of fee income enjoyed by ClarusONE. So, I think that's an important distinction to make between COGS and the NCI line, and then focusing on the NCI line as fee income from a contracting outfit.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","And there are other things in NCI that aren't related to ClarusONE at all.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah, yeah. There are multiple other drivers in the NCI line. So, those can drive volatility in any one particular quarter.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","That's incredibly helpful. One just quick follow-up. You spent about $1.9 billion in acquisitions. You've highlighted them to us already. Is there any potential impact from these acquisitions in the second half of this year, or will the benefits be mostly a fiscal 2019 type of event?","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Well, I think it's most likely going to fall into FY 2019. We contemplated the closure of some of these acquisitions as we provided the original guidance, and we knew that certain of these transactions were going to close. But I don't think they'll have any material impact on our FY 2018 guidance. And whatever impact we do anticipate is embedded in our reaffirmation of that guidance today.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys, so much.","Operator","We will now go to Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, your line is open Hearing no response, we'll move to Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. A follow-up to the last question, I guess, can you give us an update on the performance and where we stand with some of the potential synergies and contributions from some of the recent acquisitions, like CoverMyMeds and Rexall and Biologics? And can you also speak to maybe the profit profile of some of the more recent acquisitions that you've done? Thanks.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. I'd say that our approach to the integrations of those various transactions that you note are going along nicely. We're hitting our synergy cases and so forth. So no, we're pleased. We feel as though those acquisitions fit very nicely with the strategies that we're pursuing across our organization. So, in terms of...","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","The margin profile...","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. That...","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","As I say, that was going to follow more aligned with the kind of businesses that they are. So, the distribution-related businesses will have more of a distribution margin and the technology businesses, like CoverMyMeds, will have a margin rate that's much higher and much similar to the rest.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Yeah. And one further thing that I would note, going back to how we were talking about operating expenditure for the full year, multiple of those transactions, those acquisitions fall into either the retail arena or the technology arena. And in those types of businesses, you tend to have more operating expenditures as a percent of revenue than would be the norm for our traditional business.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","That's in the OpEx line.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, a follow-up to that one as well. I mean, as you think about your capital deployment strategy and the priorities there in terms of acquisitions, I guess, do you see sort of a healthy pipeline out there, opportunities potentially in tangential businesses? And what sort of annual deal spend are \u2013 do you continue to expect at this point? Thanks.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","It's probably difficult to speculate on what the annual deal spent would be. I think what's best for us to sort of reaffirm here is that we do prefer M&A. But as you know, we do this in a portfolio way. We're not afraid to do share repurchases. We talked about our share repurchases in the quarter and we clearly talked about our dividend again in this press release and we talked about M&A. The critical thing, from my perspective, is that the M&A has to make financial sense. And we focus on our long-term cost of capital and making sure that these acquisitions come in well above our cost of capital and that we get the kind of returns that are appropriate on these investments.","And the answer to the other part of your question, we do have a pipeline of acquisitions that we actively work almost seemingly all the time. And sometimes, they come to be and sometimes they don't, for various reasons, but I think we're pleased there are still opportunities for us in various markets. I think we have time for one more question, Jessica.","Operator","And we'll go to John Ransom from Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Oh, boy, I get to be last. That's better than nothing. So, thank you for squeezing me in. I'm sorry that was \u2013 I didn't mean that to be serious. Just one thing in our model that there seem to be a big sequential drop in depreciation from the second quarter. So, the EBIT number was better, but the EBITDA number was a little below our number. Can you provide some help on that number? Is this the new normal given some of the portfolio changes that you've made?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, perhaps, one thing to note is that as we proceeded to be close to the sale of EIS to Allscripts, that transaction closed on the first day of Q3. But in terms of the way our accounting runs, we put it as held-for-sale in Q2. So, that might be one of the items that you'd want to focus on.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","But I mean \u2013 so you are running about, what, $27 million or something in depreciation in the third \u2013 it was (1:03:05) like a $70 million drop. I'm just asking on a go-forward basis, is this the right depreciation number for the back half of the year?","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","Well, I wouldn't expect anything material in terms of the rate and pace of change in depreciation. But we can certainly follow up with you...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.","...John, on the specifics.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thanks so much.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","All right. Thanks, John, and...","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters.","John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.","Thanks, Jessica, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. I also certainly want to, once again, say thanks to Paul Julian for nearly 25 years of friendship and 21 years here at McKesson. And I'm confident that in retirement he and I are going to continue to stay close and I wish he and Michelle (1:04:00) all the best, and his family, going forward.","McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2018 plan and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible as most clearly demonstrated this quarter by how we came together to provide the support to those impacted by the recent natural disasters.","I'll now hand the call over to Craig to review upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?","Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.","Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, Mellissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a brief business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions.","Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson.","In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments.","We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports.","Thank you. And here's John Hammergren.","John Hammergren","Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. As we had an opportunity to speak with many of our investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have three key messages I want to leave you with today.","First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016.","Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we've made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies.","And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I am as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business of healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation in our customer first mindset has repelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business.","Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy affectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","Year-to-date we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock. We paid nearly $1 billion of long-term debt and made internal capital investments at $417 million and paid a $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?","James Beer","Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11 and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90.","Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, Schedule 3 of the accompanying tables to our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results.","During the third quarter and the first nine months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures.","Now, let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments.","Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5% led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.","Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year driven by the performance of distribution solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses, and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio.","Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sales of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year.","Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency.","Now moving to taxes, this quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discreet tax items which totaled approximately $0.07 primarily reflecting recent Celesio first of changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year we continued to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%.","Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18 up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency. Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to $232 million.","During the third quarter we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. In fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock.","Overall we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends and we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $233 million for the full fiscal year.","Now let\u2019s turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter reflecting growth of 6%.","North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6 billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical Specialty and Canadian businesses offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter.","International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.","Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015 partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business.","Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion.","Overall the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio related procurement synergies.","Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter.","Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result.","Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we on outlined on January, 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solution segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year.","Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter, and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.","During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sales of nurse triage business.","Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year.","On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2% representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses. For the full year, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range.","Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days, sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days.","Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days. We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long term debt and paid a $179 million in dividends.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rates of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance.","In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO related adjustments.","In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our longstanding portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melissa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","First question is on kind of a distribution segment operating margin. When we look at gross for the North America business in a normalized basis about up 7% year-over-year, it's kind of like the disclosed level that we've seen since fiscal year '14. So should we think about this as kind of a new market growth for the segment and is HCV kind of like the key factor there that kind of like contributed to that mid teen growth in last 18 months that we should \u2013 that have kind of like normalized and will do so going forward?","James Beer","Well, the first part of your question I would expect that is our normal cause give you more of a steer for FY17 margins when we do our update in early May. So as it relates to what is being impacting the margin thus far is obviously, we've spoken extensively about the impact for generic price increases. And that's really being the driver of that margin results the DS function. Could you just repeat the second part of the question?","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. The question was really not about the margin, it was more about the topline for distribution solution for North America. It's kind of like up 7% in the last kind of like 18 months, we've seen this growth in kind of like low to mid and even high teens. So the question really is the two parts toward, like forward looking is 7% the new growth rate and then when you look at what's driving the slow down, is it kind of like did you seen an abnormal growth from HCV?","John Hammergren","We had a \u2013 Ricky, this is John. We had a very large - we have a very large customers in the mail business that had some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer winds. You saw us benefit from a revenue perspective that help pushes into the double digits in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs.","So the combination of those two events were probably the things that propelled us from the revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is more consistent with what we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running out today.","Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mix perspective and I think to James' point is probably little premature for us to talk about FY17 revenue forecast. But I think we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of any customer changes that might happen during the year either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or when on occasions sometimes we lose a piece of business like we did with a large mail to customers just recently.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the gross profit margins \u2013 actually third quarter gross profit came in a little bit better than we've kind of like expected and seems \u2013 you still seeing kind of like benefit from kind of like buy side margin. So when we think about the new guidance that you provided few weeks ago, should we think about kind of like this quarter to third quarter it's kind of like the last quarter, we should think about modeling is like seeing a benefit on the buy side from generic information. And from this point on we should think like a bad, like a slowdown or like modulated, like the 0% that you've highlighted a few weeks ago?","John Hammergren","Well, I would emphasize our view around a generic price inflation was normal, so not zero, but certainly modest \u2013 certainly significantly down from when we came into this fiscal year with much higher expectations.","James Beer","So there is really no change in what we said to you on January 11. Things are coming through as we had sort of expected.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","On the administrative cost structure review, you guys shared earlier this month. Just looking back over the last few years and trying to adjust for acquisitions like PSS and Celesio. It looks to us that SG&A has grown somewhere in the 10% range per year. As we think about the cost structure review and some of the client attrition, you've experienced over the last year. How should we think about the right level of annual SG&A growth? Just any progress you guys have made. I know it's early, but any progress you've made in that review details behind it will be helpful for us.","John Hammergren","Well, it is early in our work. Obviously, this is something that we did embed within the preliminary guide that we offered a couple of weeks ago for fiscal '17. But we're going through the detailed work now. We do think that there is opportunity and I've noted before that that opportunity would likely drive a one-time charge in Q4 of the current quarter. And will be able to hence provide an update in May. But certainly we feel that there is some opportunity.","James Beer","And Robert, I think it's probably fair to say that looking at our SG&A without all of the acquisition noise that comes in and goes out and certainly currency fluctuation are really \u2013 if you look at our internal numbers in our calculations, our SG&A is normally growing in the low single digit kind of range. So we typically don't average at 10% increase in SG&A that would be way outside the boundaries if you look on base core expense kind of trajectory it's nowhere near that.","So I think you might see some abnormalities occasionally because of M&A and how that flows through, as well as some of those currency stuff that I think overtime you should expect our SG&A to grow more that single digit rates, once we get passed at some of this work we're doing today on administrative costs.","Robert Jones","Got it. I guess there is lot of focus on the pharma business maybe just on medical. It looks like it was essentially flat revenue growth there both sequentially and year-over-year. I think originally what you guys are talking about mid-single digit type growth for this year. So I guess what's changed relative to your original expectations and then any thoughts about the trajectory of the medical business growth from here will be helpful.","James Beer","With medical surgical revenues, we updated our guide quarter or so ago to be low to mid single digit revenue growth and that was driven by our sale of ZEE Medical. So we talked also about the strength of the primarily care business within medical surgical. And there were some challenges on the extended care side, but overall we're very pleased with the continued development of the business.","John Hammergren","I think you have to net it for ZEE that's probably the thing the most people miss when they look at those numbers. So we don't adjust those out. They are in our adjusted numbers with you and your reflection.","Robert Jones","And nothing changed on the end market side then?","James Beer","No, not really. And we've seen a little bit of weakness in flu, but that's not going to be something you're going to see dampen our overall revenue to significant extent. It really is the sale of ZEE.","Operator","We'll next go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette","I guess for me just a quick question on the expected anti-trust litigation settlement gain for fiscal '17 that you alluded to a few weeks ago. And that extra $70 million year-over-year adds an extra $0.20 or $0.25 in fiscal '17 that we assume normal tax rate, which is fine. But just, is there any chance you can walk through the drivers of aerodynamic so what's going on there just to better understand. And why those gains were greater fiscal '17.","John Hammergren","These things come through in unforecastable and sometimes lumpy fashions. It's really is just a single settlement. It's quite large by comparison to others that we receive and certainly by comparison to other years, so I think that\u2019s really it.","James Beer","Yes. And the case is quite far along, which is why we felt it was sensible to make an assumption that we would enjoy that $140 million benefit in fiscal '17.","Steven Valiquette","The other real quick on is just the $0.85 that you talked about for - you're heading fiscal '17 from a combination of a generic pricing and customer transitions. Obviously, we're still getting a lot of calls on that. Is there any chance that you're willing to maybe give just a bit more color just size wise on the magnitude of one of those buckets versus the other within that $0.85 at this stage or you still going to perhaps hold off on it till later.","John Hammergren","Well, I'd like to say that the majority of that $0.85 has being driven by generic price increases changes.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","John shifting gears little bit given the kind of recent pull back in the market assets would seem to be more attractively valued right now. I guess can you talk little about whether or not the company feels pressured to put capital to work and are on the capital deployment strategy may be talk about the appetite for increasing the companies leverage ratio and the appetite for deals that might add another leg to the store something that might be more transformational as it relates to the business.","John Hammergren","Well, thanks for the question, it clearly - we try not to feel pressure on any dimension because it may cause you do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet is become healthier and we paid off some of the debt and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to de-levering after Celesio, we are very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way and we planned to continued to do so.","I would say that, the fluctuation and evaluations does make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly even some of the private companies have might have dreamed of IPOs et cetera may be more available to a conversation with us than they might have been otherwise.","And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then de-lever again give us creditability with making our commitments a reality and I think that the issue of another leg on the stool or transformational deal and clearly we look at any deal that make sense to its financially and strategically. I don\u2019t think we push anything away from the table.","But having said that, synergies are usually more possible on deals that in more line of side on deals that are in one of the segment that were currently participating in. And so I would tell you that our buyers is to go into businesses that we currently understand and operate as suppose to something that\u2019s for a field when the synergies are based on some expectation that the markets are going to be more attractive whether going to grow faster and we use we can add lot to those values if we don\u2019t have synergies to bring into the transaction.","George Hill","And then may be just a quick follow up again we\u2019ll kick and hit the generics topic again. You guys have pretty modest expectations for generic price inflation in fiscal 17 but lot of the back - the drivers they drove generic price inflation haven\u2019t changed much. I guess can you talk about, can you give us any color on what you\u2019re saying in the channel on what's driving the diminished rate of change and inflation and I guess I\u2019m looking for more anecdotal information that helps us kind of see what\u2019s going on in the market there. Thank you.","John Hammergren","You may recall that we talked about generic inflation in the past, we talked about the fact that is driven by a small number of molecules from a small number of manufactures that have inflated to very high degree and I\u2019d say that our current experiences at some of those out layer increases have diminished significantly. But overall if you think about the portfolio overtime it has been in more of a deflationary mode so we talk about inflation. We really talking about the net effect of inflation on our business driven by those molecules not the overall portfolio inflating or deflating because that typically deflates.","We think that its \u2013 we\u2019re in a period now where we\u2019re going to have modest inflation that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been experiencing, that\u2019s what we talked about in January 11, and that\u2019s what we anticipate for the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal years is modest generic inflation.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","John, few weeks ago we talked about the incremental opportunity to add incremental generic procurement deals. I think you talked about the fact that you've done some Safeway are hold [ph] and some others. But can may be just remind us of what you see as incremental opportunities that are still available to you within your own book of business out in the marketplace?","John Hammergren","Well, clearly we have made significant progress in helping our customers procure generics more affectively and use our distribution channel to bring them to their stores at a more cost effective way as well. And so I think we\u2019ve have seen progress you mentioned our hold and Albertson's Safeway and many of our independent customers have continued to join us in the generic procurement side and have become more and more reliant on the customs ability to help them reduce their cost and improve their performance.","Our Health Mart stores are now above 45,00 stores and that program has been extremely successful in driving generics and our proprietary generics programs are still growing in healthy double digit kind of ranges.","So overall I think we continue to make progress. Some of our largest customers still procure some are all of their generics on their own, through their own distribution network and do their own sourcing activities and we continue to have conversations with those customers about the value of using McKesson\u2019s combined power with their to do an even better job and those conversations obviously are important to us as we think about the relationship of these customers.","It would be premature for me to talk about specifically which customers we think might provide the most opportunity but I don\u2019t think the table isn\u2019t run yet relative to opportunity for us.","Lisa Gill","Is there a way to quantify that number of may be using analogy of \u2013 if you want to use to baseball at innings as far as how penetrated you are in your current book just so we can think about as we move into '17 and '18 beyond what the potential incremental opportunities are as it pertains to these hyper generic procurement relationships.","James Beer","I will say the opportunities not in significant and many of you have talked to us about specific customers that you know are continuing to procure a large majority of their generics on their own. And so I think it's not an material impact in front of us if we\u2019re able to persuade these customers with the data that we have that our procurement activity would be beneficial to them.","I\u2019m hesitant to describe it in innings, including customer count. We\u2019ve got a lot of customers using us today but in customer value based on the size of their generic spend their significant opportunity left for us.","Lisa Gill","And then just my follow-up would just be both sounds well, as well as UDT now in a second review process. Was that your initial expectation and how should we think about the timeline of closing those two acquisitions.","John Hammergren","Our initial expectation was at the regulation, regulatory process would be extended and follow about the pattern that we have seen before in this country and I think we\u2019ll remain extremely optimistic that these transactions are examined through their process that we will stand a very good chance of accomplishing the acquisitions in large and reform that we had expected when we announced them.","And then answer to your earlier question also Lisa relative to procurement, I might also point out that the opportunities for us extend beyond just the U.S. and many times customers look - you look at customers that you know of in the U.S. that are buying on their own but there are also customer buying on their own in other important markets for us where we and they have the ability to dispense to generic that we\u2019ve sourced together.","And so I think that we remain very optimistic with our global activity and our procurement programs will continue to grow.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen","Can you please talk about the competitive environment. So when you got a market and bid for a new pieces of business, how is the pricing environment now that we\u2019ve got, couple of large JVs that are in the market, with like Red Oak and Rite Aid. Can you sort of talk about, what the pricing environment looks like? Has there been a significant shift in 2015, 2016 relative to previous years or not. Thanks.","John Hammergren","It's difficult Dave to comment on pricing because it's sort of in the lands of where we are currently doing business and where we\u2019re competing for business. I would say that overall the business remains competitive but stabilized. I don\u2019t see a lot of customer changes that would drive one to believe that there is something going on the materially different from a pricing perspective out in the marketplace.","I can speak for McKesson's strategy and that is we continue to focus heavily on our selling efforts within our existing customer base trying to find ways to add more value to those relationships and through that value added create a relationship that has more stability but it also provides a better profit for our customers and better profit for McKesson as we evolve these partnerships. And so I think our principle focus is in the area of expanding our footprint with the existing customers and helping them perform better.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","So may be just quickly we saw some headlines last week or so on some core rulings in Germany. Can you just remind us sort of where we are with the Celesio staff and the process let there, sort of determine whether or not you, we\u2019ll get to kind of ultimately acquire the remaining portion and how we should think about the purchase price?","James Beer","Well, first of all, we own around 76% of Celesio and for the other 24 points or so of the ownership, they have a put to us. We do not have a call on those shares outstanding. As to the news these past few days related to suit that Magnetar had brought that we had previously seen dismissed at the local court level if you will, back in December of 2014.","That decision was appealed by Magnetar. It did get overturn just a few days ago. We are planning to appeal that decision and I would expect that process to play-out over a year or more.","And given the issues specific to this case, I think it is unlikely that McKesson will be required to pay what some have been extrapolating as the substantial liability, the case at hand related quite narrowly to a few shares that had been put to us.","And so the court decision related to around \u20ac260,000 total. We see an extrapolation from that figure up into the \u20ac370 million range. I would not expect given the specifics of the case and the process around German law, that we would be looking at that sort of payment.","John Hammergren","And I'd also point out to this obviously, there is no effect on the operating control we\u2019ve already established with Celesio. There is really no effect on our financial statements other than this potential cash liability but the - we consolidated their earnings, we operate the company and to James' point, this outstanding share are remain outstanding and can be put to us when they decide they want to put them to us.","Ross Muken","And just quickly on the Rite Aid front. Can you just help us think through, sort of, how you have to game plan for an outcome there? I mean, obviously you are not be going to able to share with us, sort of, what the discussions go like [indiscernible].","I\u2019m just trying to think practically in terms of, as you have to have that decision tree of what the various options are, how quickly, if the business ultimately transitions this year, next year whenever, how quickly you can adjust your cost structure? How flexible it is and what are these sort of things we should look for to best understand, how that will impact the parts of the P&L.","John Hammergren","First off I\u2019d remind folks that on early January I've made a comment about this business we believe will be retained by McKesson in its current form through late in our fiscal 17 numbers. And so with the guidance we\u2019ve given you for fiscal 17, that range includes that we would - or assumes that we\u2019d continue to enjoy the Rite Aid business in relative its same relative form through that end of that period. Obviously, we could be off, plus or minus depending on what your view of the process by which Walgreens will complete the transaction and how that may actually take shape.","I'd say that we were reluctant to ever comment on what a customer might do when the decision is in their hands. I\u2019d say however, you\u2019ve seen certain customers of ours, value the incumbent relationship and continue to enjoy a relationship with McKesson going forward like you do at target at Omnicare where the relationship change from a mix perspective but we are able to retain at least a portion of the business.","I would not take that speculation and apply it necessarily to Walgreens but I\u2019d just point that out as certainly an alternative that has some possibility other than that not much I can say Ross.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian","Good afternoon John, James. James first question to you. Could you first repeat what the technology solutions adjusted constant currency margins were for this quarter which I think favorably benefited margins. But even if so, it\u2019s been quite strong year-to-date that you\u2019re not guiding to the 20% margin level for the year. So is there anything unique for us to some of these trends wouldn\u2019t continue into next year?","James Beer","Well, I have been pleased with the operating margin trends in technology solutions in recent quarters and I think it very much reflects the work that the team there has been doing to reorient our focus to specific businesses around our peer solutions, around our transactional type offerings and also our imaging business, as well as our revenue cycle management businesses.","So we've really shifted the focus to those areas where we think we have nice growth opportunities and we have solid margins. And that has flowed through in combination with good cost control to allow us to record much stronger margins with the comment that we think for the full year will be in the low 20s.","About one point of that margin benefit of course, remember comes from the sale of our care management business a couple of quarters or so ago. So that's really the story on the technology margins. Overall, in constant currency the margin number itself is 20.5%.","Garen Sarafian","20.5, okay. Great. And then maybe going back to your question that was just asked regarding grade Rite Aid. Previously, you guys have sort of shied away from acquiring to the retail pharmacy space as there could be some conflicts at least in the U.S. that's not present in Europe.","So with the potential acquisition in Rite Aid where there is the possibility of a material amount of stores being sold. Are you willing to reconsider that view or would there still be too much of an impact with your remaining retail clients taken through that?","James Beer","I don't think we will be interested in buying the stores. To the extent stores are divested and we would not be interested in buying them. That's not the business we're in in the U.S.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric Coldwell","My primary McKesson ones have been covered at this point, but I am curious after many years of waiting we finally got the AMP final rule 658 pages of glory. I'm curious if you and your teams have had a chance to go through that at all. And if there is anything that stands out to you as you think about your business over the next year once that \u2013 I guess it goes into affect actually starting fiscal '17 for you, but curious where your thoughts might be if you have any at this point.","John Hammergren","I've read the whole thing several times and highlighted the areas of most interest to me. Obviously, it's still very early to understand all of the implications and to understand the ability of the states to implement this rule. I think that it's likely to be pretty limited in the states that have already largely moved to manage medicate program in recent years. This really is a state medicate fee for service kind of an application and I guess our initial assessment is that we expected to have a fairly limited impact in the supply chain as we see it today.","Operator","We'll next go to Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher","John, I'd like to go back to the first question where you were asked to pine on 7% as perhaps a going-forward number. When we look at 7% in this quarter and the decline relative to the prior quarters, you mentioned a couple of items, but it's fair to think over the next several quarters we've got a contract movement, we have the sale of assets, FX may become an easier comp going forward.","So is it fair to say that that's not reflective of long-term industry growth or how do you think about long-term industry growth today?","John Hammergren","Well, I'm reluctant to make an industry call. You guys are and others are well positioned to do that. Clearly, part of what you have to look at is the amount of generic launches that come out, what kind of price inflation you're going to get on the branded launches. What kind of specialty drugs might hit and when. So there is lot of complexity.","I guess what I was attempting to describe was that the relative higher rate that we had in advance of this quarter was driven by some specific customer wins that happen to flow through our P&L and that lapping affect of that success by that customer is what \u2013 is comparative that we\u2019re chatting it outside. That makes sense to your - ","Eric Percher","Yes. And as we've gone a couple of weeks into the year as you look at brand inflation trends, have you seen the political discussion translate into any material change in those trends?","John Hammergren","No we really haven't seen any change of any significance in the branded side and I'd say that the results are aligned with our expectations.","Operator","We'll take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee","John, just going back to your expectations on inflation and not only just generic, but also maybe on branded, how you guys are thinking about in terms of this being election year and to the extent that you're seeing sort of a moderating environment. Any thoughts on as to how much you think may be an election cycle is impacting that?","John Hammergren","Well, it's also is difficult to speculate on what the drivers are. We are not the ones making the decision on the generic or the branded side is relative to inflation.","I would say the political discourse that's taking place and the congressional inquires relative to pricing practices, I think are obviously going to have people at least pausing perhaps to consider whether now is the right time to take price increase.","There obviously are other circumstances related to pricing associated with supply disruption, availability, new product launches. I mean there is all kinds of things that probably play into the calculus here and I would say \u2013 I think the political discussions really, clearly and the media discussion probably has some impact to speculate on how much it would be difficult.","Charles Rhyee","That's fair. And then just maybe one quick follow up on that. You mentioned earlier in a response that you're clearly looking at - there is nothing really - you're going to send us few items that kind of really drove some of the inflation that you saw. Historically, you've not really seen that right now.","But is there anything structural to the market as you look forward in the next couple of years or something like that couldn't happen again or do you think there has been some changes in the market where it's probably less likely we'll see kind of what we saw maybe the last two years.","John Hammergren","I believe the performance of branded pharmaceutical companies is probably easier to forecast give that it has been less volatile in the last decade than perhaps the generic industry we've seen more volatility. And that volatility certainly is partially driven by supply and disruption.","So I would say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future then you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with branded price or generic price inflation. I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out.","We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year on that dimension of inflation both branded and generic. And we've given you our thoughts relative to fiscal '17 our guidance on those two dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that, but it's just that - those views are amongst other views we have to take every year and what might happen throughout the year and we just want to be transparent with you about what we're thinking so. I think that's probably the most I can say about it.","Charles Rhyee","Thanks a lot.","John Hammergren","I understand that we don't have any additional questions in the queue. I know we hit a lot of these subjects in early January and I appreciate all of the attention that you've paid to these matters and others and for your time on the call today. As we entered the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges they may face.","The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and by staying focused on our customers and through to our core values. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for a review of upcoming events for the financial community.","Erin Lampert","Thank you, John. On February 10, we will present at the Leerink Partners Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in May. Thank you and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a good day."]}}
