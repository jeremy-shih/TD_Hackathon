The phone number for the replay is 719-457-0820 and the code is 7812766.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Kneeley, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bob Kneeley - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, April, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Envision's earnings conference call for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Our presenters today are Chris Holden, our Chief Executive Officer and President; Karey Witty, Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Eastridge, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Brian Jackson, President of Envision Physician Services and Phil Clendenin, President of AMSURG are available for the question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.","We encourage you to carefully review the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed earlier this year, in addition to the risks and uncertainties described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, expected to be filed in the coming days.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday afternoon, along with our remarks on this call are made as of today, May 8, 2018, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued yesterday afternoon, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.evhc.net. We encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website regularly, which we use to communicate important information regarding Envision Healthcare to investors.","I'll now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Chris Holden. Chris?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report our first quarter 2018 results exceeded the top end of our guided ranges. Revenue of $2.08 billion grew by 10.6% led by Physician Services and at a pace beyond the anticipated contribution from an active flu season.","An adjusted EBITDA of $207.6 million beat consensus and was $2.5 million over the high end of our range. Adjusted EPS was $0.71, which exceeded the top end of our range by $0.04. Physician Services revenue growth of 13.2% included organic revenue growth of 5%, in line with our outlook for the year. Ambulatory surgery revenue declined slightly year-over-year, impacted by weather and flu-related procedure cancellations.","As you may recall from our last earnings call, our budget for this year incorporates our operational improvement plan. Our focus is on expanding our margins for the year. Our first quarter results reflect significant progress towards that goal in sync with our 2018 plan of $50 million of realized operational improvements, ending the year at run rate efficiencies of $100 million. Karey Witty, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide additional detail on the improvements that are currently underway.","All-in, this was a solid quarter, building on the momentum we established with our results for last quarter. And we maintain our confidence in our forecast for 2018. We continue to have strong new contract sales. We started 44 new contracts in the first quarter of the year, including starts of contracts that were awarded in 2017. About two-thirds of the contracts we sold during the quarter are to existing health system partners. Approximately two-thirds of the new contracts started were in the emergency medicine and hospital medicine service line.","Our M&A pipeline is strong, and we continue to evaluate opportunities for growth. Through April, we invested approximately $128 million in acquisitions or about 30% of our annual goal. Of that, about $91 million was in Physician Services, which included two radiology groups and an anesthesia group completed in April. We invested $37 million in Ambulatory Services and expanded our footprint in Phoenix to include a large ophthalmology acquisition.","On the managed care contracting front, we continue to make progress in negotiating our out-of-network revenue to in-network. In 2017, we migrated nearly $500 million of out-of-network revenue to in-network status. For 2018, we've targeted the migration of another $250 million of out-of-network revenue and have achieved approximately $100 million of that goal for the year.","By year-end, we expect less than 5% of our total revenue will be out-of-network. And we expect the negotiations currently underway to be neutral to revenue and margin. And while we're on the topic of managed care, allow me to spend a minute to discuss our recently launched Patients First initiative. We continue to educate and influence the public narrative on the issue of surprise coverage. We use the term surprise coverage rather than surprise billing because, given the proliferation of high deductible plans, patients are often surprised by their financial responsibility, whether they visit an in-network or out-of-network provider. We're shining a bright light on an increasingly dysfunctional system and offering productive solutions to better serve all constituents, with patients always being the top priority.","Over the past year, Envision has led the charge in shaping solutions and boldly announced our strategic commitment to a comprehensive in-network strategy. We remain fully committed to that strategy and believe it has been and will continue to be a positive differentiator for Envision. So, why is solving this issue so important to us? Our primary mission is providing the highest quality patient care. We dedicate ourselves each day to working with our physician colleagues and health system partners to create the best possible experience for the patient. But patients want a more seamless and integrated system of care. Our vision is to align our large suite of high-performing clinical solutions with our health system and payor stakeholders to advance that integration.","We feel strongly that better integration across clinical networks will allow us to improve the quality, transparency, and efficiency of the healthcare system. I encourage you to visit our website at www.evhc.net to review our Patients First initiative, and in particular, a recently published position paper that outlines many of the current challenges facing providers, along with the solutions we support. Those solutions include: a strategic commitment to in-network status whenever possible; statutory clarity around payment resolution at the state and federal level; a minimum benefit standard for safety net services such as emergency care; and the appropriate use of an independent and transparent charge database.","We strongly believe payors, regulators, and providers must work collaboratively. We object to many of the current payor tactics that fuel conflict and adversely impact the unique relationship between the patient and the physician. For example, challenges to the prudent layperson standard, capricious withholding or denial of payments by payors after services are rendered by the provider, health plan benefit design that shifts too much of the financial burden away from the insurer or the employer to the patient.","We're in a unique position to bring a voice for change on behalf of our physician partners and colleagues. Our resolve is strong. And in certain circumstances, formal disputes are necessary to preserve contractual rights and remedies.","And, as you are aware, we are involved in a known dispute with a large national payor. And recently, the court found our contract's arbitration clause to be enforceable and transitioned the matter to arbitration, a positive indication regarding the overall enforceability of our contract. But for obvious reasons, we do not publicly discuss the details of ongoing litigation, dispute resolutions, or negotiations with payors. And we intend to adhere to that rule on this call today.","Understand that such disputes are common in the payor\/provider world and often advance the dialogue in a very positive manner. And it should come as no surprise that in the ordinary course of business, we are in numerous active payor negotiations for a portion of our revenue each year. And this year is no different. We have a team of experts who provide great leadership and management of that process. We have a strong track record of productive negotiation and dispute resolution, spanning several decades. We remain confident in our ability to draw from that success in our current contracting cycle.","Our guidance reflects an informed view on the collective outcome of those pending negotiations. We understand that change often evokes criticism from skeptics and those with competing agendas; however, the most interesting observation from all that is that we seem to agree that surprise coverage is the key issue that must be addressed. And for those who doubt our commitment to being part of the solution, we ask you to consider our progress over the past year. We will continue our market leadership and welcome all support in creating a broader movement to drive positive change on this societal issue.","And with that, this is a good time to turn the call over to Karey Witty, our Chief Operating Officer, for an update on our operational improvement program. Karey?","Karey L. Witty - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will provide an update of our progress on the operational improvement initiatives we began in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are primarily focused on our Physician Services segment.","Our actions contributed to Physician Services adjusted EBITDA growth and drove a 50 basis point margin expansion on a sequential basis. This is a significant accomplishment, considering the impact of the first quarter's seasonal payroll tax expense. We were successful in managing to the key metrics that drove clinical and administrative efficiencies, and I'm encouraged by our progress towards achieving our performance targets for 2018.","As Chris stated in his opening remarks, our plan to realize $50 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA from improvements for fiscal 2018 equates to a $100 million run rate plan for 2019. I'll remind you of our three areas of focus. They are revenue cycle management, clinical labor management, and operational efficiencies from support costs.","Let me first discuss revenue cycle management. Our stated goal is to consolidate RCM by service line into a center of excellence model. After a period of transition, it is our intent that we will improve our DSOs, optimize yield from all payment sources, and reduce our total cost per bill. While some of these efforts began in late 2017, during the first quarter we continued and accelerated the transition of our revenue cycle functions. We transitioned 1.5 million emergency medicine and hospital medicine charts at more than 25 sites during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.","Additionally, we began transitioning our radiology billing to our selected third-party partner in Q4. These transitions continued into Q1 of 2018 and currently total 3 million radiology charts. This migration is a factor in the slight increase in Physician Services DSOs during the first quarter of 2018. We also launched an important initiative to deploy new front-end technologies to improve overall chart capture and chart acquisition processes.","Regarding clinical labor, we saw a marked improvement on several fronts. Our short-term objective was to shift an additional 10% of temporary clinical staffing to our internal solutions. In the first quarter, we moved 4 percentage points of our total 2018 target. We also improved clinical productivity by applying greater disciplines to staffing and adjusting schedules at the margin to reflect current-period volume. Under our plan, we expect further improvements in labor management in the latter part of 2018.","Finally, last quarter I committed to provide an update on our efforts to improve our cost structure as a percent of revenue. In the first quarter of 2018, these items were 10.9% of revenue, which is 20 basis points ahead of our expectations. We realized $8 million of improvement across all aspects of our support structure with focused attention to personnel costs, consulting costs, and general overhead costs.","At the end of the first quarter, we are at an annualized run rate of $27 million of operational improvements and well on our way towards our $100 million target. Overall, in a short period of time, we have been successful in reducing our support costs, decelerating the rate of growth of other expenses, and successfully challenging ourselves to find efficiencies. Importantly, we were ahead of our expectations on these items in the first quarter, which contributed to the results that exceeded our guidance.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Eastridge for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and an update on our 2018 guidance. Kevin?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, Karey, and good morning, everyone. As both Chris and Karey have mentioned, our results from operations for the first quarter of 2018 were solid and slightly ahead of our guidance. For Envision, revenues were $2.08 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $207.6 million for consolidated margin of 10%.","Adjusted net earnings were $86.6 million or $0.71 per share. Envision's results reflect strong expense management across each of our business units, Physician Services, Ambulatory Services, and Evolution Health, which is a component of the Physician Services segment.","Now, looking at our segments, Physician Services' net revenue was $1.77 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 13.2% over the prior year period. Revenue growth was balanced with 8.2% coming from acquisitions and 5% revenue growth from organic sources. Same contract revenue growth contributed 2.7% to total revenue growth, while net new contract growth added 2.3%, a slight improvement to the prior quarter.","Organic growth drivers in the first quarter were consistent with, though, at the high end of our expected contribution for 2018 budget. Same contract revenue growth was 3.1% and that consisted of patient volume growth of 2.3% and 0.8% rate growth. Segment volume growth of 2.3% was driven by growth across all service line with emergency medicine and hospitalist volume growth the most meaningful contributor.","Overall, rate growth of 0.8% was impacted by an expected shift in emergency medicine acuity related to the flu volume. Blended emergency medicine and hospitalist rate was slightly negative because of lower hospitalist medicine rate per encounter. All other service lines had positive rate increases.","Adjusted EBITDA for Physician Services was $150.1 million or 8.5% of revenue. While Physician Services' margins appear to have declined from the prior-year period they were actually consistent after adjusting for specific items including incentive compensation accruals that were lower at levels in the 2017 first quarter than in the 2018 period by approximately $4 million, positive settlement in 2017 primarily for 2016 claims that were related to in-network migration in the first quarter of 2017 accounting to approximately $5 million, and Physician Services malpractice expense in the first quarter of 2018, which was $8 million higher than we expected due to the settlement of claims from prior years.","Evolution Health also contributed to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter as a result of operating improvement efforts I just mentioned; reversing from a loss in the first quarter and contributing to sequential adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of 2018.","Our Ambulatory Services segment was impacted by weather-related cancellations during the quarter, reducing revenue and affecting same-center volume. In addition, while hard to quantify with precision, we had a number of procedures that were canceled because of flu-related symptoms affecting both patients and care teams.","For the first quarter of 2018, revenue was $307.6 million, which declined by 2.6% from the prior year. First quarter revenue was impacted by $9.7 million related to center de-consolidations and disposals that were included in the prior-year period. Same-center revenue declined by 0.7%, as a result of a 1.3% volume decline. Same-center rate per procedure grew by 0.6%.","Adjusted EBITDA was $57.5 million or 18.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 and this compares with $60.2 million or 19.1% of revenue for the prior-year period. Despite the impact of weather and flu, operating results at our ASC business benefited from effective management of other operating expenses.","Turning to the balance sheet, we had several changes to our balance sheet in the first quarter of 2018, largely as a result of the completion of the AMR divestiture, and this is reflected in the significant increase in cash at the end of the period and a reduction in total debt of $1.7 billion.","The AMR transaction resulted in the receipt of gross proceeds of roughly $2.3 billion and we used $1.7 billion of that to initially pay down a portion of our Term Loan B facility, with more expected to be paid in the following quarters.","At the end of the quarter, total debt was approximately $4.7 billion. We have held on to some of the proceeds from the transaction, in part, to pay related taxes that are due next month. In addition, we maintained slightly higher than normal cash balances based on estimated timing of acquisition closing. In fact, as Chris mentioned, we completed one physician group practice in an ASC acquisition in April.","We ended the quarter with $767.4 million in cash, resulting in net debt of approximately $3.9 billion at March 31. Our leverage ratio as defined under our credit agreement is currently 4.2 times, down from 4.6 times at December 31, and that degree of de-levering is consistent with what we stated on our fourth quarter call.","Envision's Physician Services DSO increased by 1 day sequentially and ambulatory surgery centers DSO increased by 2 days sequentially. Accounts receivable grew at a rate faster than revenue, principally as a result of several factors including; strong revenue growth in the quarter, including acquisitions, which leads to an accounts receivable build; revenue cycle migration, as Karey previously discussed; and a lag in onboarding both new in-network relationships, as well as new contract activity.","First quarter cash flow from operations was $20.4 million when excluding distributions to non-controlling interest and transaction cost. This compares with $64 million for the prior-year period. All of the difference in cash flow year-over-year can be attributed to a tax strategy prompted by changes in deductibility of expense that resulted from the tax law passed last year. By accelerating approximately $45 million of incentive compensation payments from the second quarter to the first quarter, we were able to benefit from higher tax deductions on those payments. Maintenance CapEx in the first quarter of 2018 was $45.3 million and included $23.2 million for AMR. Finally, we spent $70.2 million to acquire two physician groups during the quarter.","Now, turning to guidance, with yesterday's press release, we made minor modifications to the guidance we issued in late February. Essentially, we've moved up the low end of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA by $5 million, reflecting the strong first quarter performance relative to the original guide. There's no change to our revenue guidance for the year. As a result, we continue to expect to generate revenue of $8.3 billion (sic) [$8.35 billion] to $8.53 billion in 2018. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $965 million to $1 billion for all of 2018, or adjusted EPS of $3.49 to $3.70.","We are also introducing guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $234 million to $246 million. As we stated on our last call when we provided our initial guidance, our forecast for all of 2018 anticipates the realization of a greater percentage of our operating improvement initiatives during the second half of the year. Adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.83 to $0.90.","At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Chris for some closing comments, Chris?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. Before we open the call for questions, I want to speak briefly about our strategic review process. As we stated in the press release last night, our board of directors continues to conduct a full review of a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. We are considering a number of options. including execution of the company's strategic plan, portfolio rationalization, and a potential sale of the company. While we have not set a definitive timetable for completion of this review, the board is moving toward identification of the optimal outcome for our shareholders during the current quarter. As you're all aware, we can provide no assurance that this review will result in a transaction or alternative of any kind.","So, with that, Operator, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning. What do you think, when you're fully loaded \u2013 I mean, obviously the margins have declined from the peak about 700 basis points? In your kind of intermediate term view, where can you claw that back to? Probably not 17% (26:13), but is there an interim target that makes sense?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Hey, John, good morning. We have an aspirational goal to move the margins to the low teens. And when we think about it on a blended basis, obviously it breaks down by the different segments. In the current year, I think we're modeling somewhere in the low-double digits, somewhere around in that zone, and that's our goal, to try to drive progress each and every quarter.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, my last question would be, I think \u2013 you've said in the past, that you've had some success going back to some of your hospital partners with the ER hospitalists in getting maybe some relief on subsidies. I'm also curious about the anesthesia. We calculated that was about $100 million hit, I think, you took from the peak ebb. Over the intermediate term, how much can you, if any, get back in terms of recontracting some those deals toward more variable comp?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","John, I'm not sure. I'm not recalling the back \u2013 your anesthesia question, let me speak to the subsidy question.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, we had it at about $2 billion in revenue and about a 500 basis point hit from the peak. That was our guess, so, it was around a \u2013 but it's been kind of mysterious, you and your public partner, kind of the process of getting \u2013 is that just permanently gone? Is all the relief going to be on the ER side or is there some potential relief on the anesthesiology, assuming the mix change doesn't revert, is there any future relief from more variable contracting?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Let me answer your subsidy question first. I think the biggest positive in the quarter and coming out of the back half of the year, is the positive reception we've had in actually what I would call rescuing contracts. We had contemplated in our guidance that we may have had more terminations than we \u2013 given that we've now set a target threshold, we're going through a portfolio rationalization or a contract portfolio rationalization, but as we sat down with those customers and they began to consider switching costs, they considered the benefit of losing a high-performing partner to potentially a weaker alternative, we were able to salvage far more than we thought we could. So that's been a real positive in the quarter. I'm going to probably ask Kevin to weigh in. I don't know, Kevin, on the anesthesia question, if we can give some color to that one.","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah, I think, John, I think what you're referring to is where we reduced some of the rate expectation on the anesthesia in the back half of last year. And we're seeing consistent rate growth in the anesthesia moving into 2018.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah, as \u2013 I recall, there was a lot of misunderstanding about the anesthesia issue in the back half of last year. There was not a systemic change in our contract rates or any type of recontracting. What we really saw was a payor mix impact really from losing Florida in the back half of the year. And, as you know, since you live there, John, you know the migration patterns into that state in the winter months, with the storms that we saw in Q3 and the recovery that lasted into Q4, you didn't have those same patterns in the state of Florida, which is a big concentration for us. So, it created, I would argue, as an artificial view that distorted or I guess created the belief that there was something systemic happening. That's really not the case.","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And, Chris, let me just jump in real quick, because I do want to correct a statement that I made. When we were talking about our guidance for the revenue, I think I quoted $8.3 billion at the low end of the range, and it's $8.35 billion to $8.53 billion, so just to clarify.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, can you hear me?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a few quick questions. One on the med-mal. You didn't really call it out as a one-timer versus EBITDA. So, what is your thought, as the year progresses, could this be a elevated run rate or how are you thinking about the impact going forward?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","No, I think what we saw in this quarter was settlements of prior years, which was a little bit unusual for within one quarter. So, I don't think that we would expect that this is the new run rate going forward, and that's not what we're anticipating. So, I think it would come back down to similar percentages of revenue in prior years.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Second question: Given the AMR sale's complete, all that kind of funky excess overhead allocation, that's all normalized in these reported numbers, right?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's correct. So, last year, as you recall, we had what we kind of refer to as trapped overhead. So, that was about $10 million. So, we'll continue to work through absorbing that. But the rest of that overhead allocation that came back from AMR, we were able to specifically identify those individuals and those people went straight with AMR.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Both net new contracts and the terminations both running a little higher than we had thought. It sounds like the terminations are running a little lower than you had thought. As we get towards the end of this year, do you feel like those numbers kind of normalize into something like a plus-5 new, minus 2 to 3 term, plus 2 to 3 net new (32:35), is that kind of where we're normalizing to or will we get to that sort of level by year-end?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Candidly, Gary, it can be a choppy process. I think last year in our \u2013 when we published the outlook document, I think I said that new sales was a 1 to 3 (32:57) range, and I'd stand by that.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Net \u2013 last question; given your comments around the strategic process contemplate potentially portfolio rationalization, wondered if you could just review for us your thoughts on the strategic fit between Physician Services and ASC, and kind of going back to when you first bought Sheridan back in 2012 or 2013, if I recall, is the strategic synergy that you envisioned have been realized.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I would think I would tell you absolutely, yes, they have been. I think probably the most telling observation is Patrick Solomon, who heads up our sales and strategic efforts, came from \u2013 originally came out of the legacy Sheridan company; spends significant amount of time, he and his team, in the C suite talking to executives about our suite of solutions. And I think he's been impressed by the number of times that the surgery centers have bubbled up to the top of the conversation as an opportunity to \u2013 alongside our Physician Services solutions. And also, our ability to comingle our anesthesia inside of our ambulatory surgery platform has been another opportunity for us. So, all in, I think it's been \u2013 they've been very synergistic with one another.","As I've said and talked about in the opening comments, I think we've done a good job of identifying a suite of clinical solutions that help health systems and payors build out high-performing networks. I think we're thinking about it in a very differentiated way, not only in terms of the scope and breadth of what we offer and their relevance to the pain points that health systems feel today, but also in trying to get those services to work together in ways that others haven't done. So, I believe that our strategy is correct, and I think we're still early in that evolution, but I feel very confident, we've made the right decision there.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Want to go back to the commercial pricing question. Obviously, makes sense that you wouldn't want to talk about specific contract negotiation, but it does feel, at least from the outside looking in, that to some degree contracting has gotten a bit more, I guess, difficult, broadly, for the industry, and I just wanted to maybe get a little more color about what you're seeing broadly. Sounds like you're saying that this isn't an unusual year on average, but I guess it does feel a little bit more difficult now. So, I just wanted to hear a little more thoughts about that.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I don't know that I would argue that it's any more difficult than any prior year. We can negotiate \u2013 well, Kevin, to put it in context, let's argue that half of our revenue is negotiated, and the other half is set by virtue of government programs and other mechanisms, and of the portion that is negotiated, half to two-thirds of that is on some sort of staggered renegotiation schedule. So, you're renegotiating somewhere between a fourth and a third of it every year.","I think maybe what's really different is that those negotiations historically have taken place at a very small localized level. So, if you have a relationship with a large payor, it's often that you have 30 to 40 negotiations ongoing with that particular payor in any given year, really driven by their organizational structure and the state level and those different things. What makes it different is if you have one contract that governs the entire relationship.","And I would tell you that where that happens, I think that will be revisited, whether that's the right way to do it long-term. But other than that, the process of negotiating with payors has always been just course of business and it's always had that type of magnitude. And we \u2013 I think the outside world looks at those types of interactions and it makes people nervous. If you do it every day, if you know if it's your \u2013 part of your normal course of business, you get used to it after a while and it's not different. So, that's how I would view it, Kevin.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, what kind of pricing increases are you expecting on the commercial side?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We look in generally in a \u2013 and I want to be careful here, not to get into negotiations, but the easiest way to think about it is that we've historically seen rate in the 2% to 4% range when we rolled up and reported our guidance and that's sort of the blended effect of how it fits into our overall revenue profile.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, that's total rate that includes acuity and government?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Right.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then you mentioned flu a couple times, but I guess I don't remember hearing a specific quantification. Do you have \u2013 how much you thought flu added to ER volumes and how much you thought it might have hurt Surgery volumes?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. So, I think on the Surgery center side, the quantification of the flu is a little more difficult, but the ASCs are really more affected on the weather side. And so, if you combine that with what we saw from the additional flu on the ED, I think we're looking at probably on a net about $2 million in net EBITDA across the spectrum that I think we benefited from the flu season this year over last, when you kind of net the combination of what the ASC experienced, as well as Physician Services.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah, flu is a double-edged sword for us. It helps, obviously, on the emergency medicine side. It's not a helpful factor on the Surgery and anesthesia side.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess you did have a better quarter than you were expecting, but you seem to kept the rest of the year relatively stable or unchanged. Any thought process about what exactly was better this quarter, and why it doesn't necessarily flow through to the rest of the year?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, the flu is the biggest issue, obviously, and we did guide on information that we pulled together through February, so the guidance was pretty fresh.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess maybe last question, any thoughts about labor costs? I guess hearing a little bit about, particularly, I guess on the ER side that there's some wage pressure there. What are you seeing?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I don't think we're seeing anything out of the ordinary. I mean, of course labor's going to rise year-to-year, but we're certainly not seeing anything concerning from our point \u2013 our standpoint.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And Karey laid out in his comments, a number of initiatives, including our premium labor-management tactics and they \u2013 hat's off to the team, they've done a very good job over the last two quarters of getting their arms around that, and I think that you see the progress in the results.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great, thank you.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks and hello, everybody. First question, you've obviously, in the last couple of quarters, but certainly this quarter, been dealing with public press reporting about the strategic review, also about the dispute you have with one of your large payors. I wonder \u2013 I could see that potentially having impact in a variety of areas, new contract wins, contract terminations, physician recruitment, physician turnover, acquisitions. Can you comment on whether you think that press publicity, which probably you'd rather not have, is that having any impact on any of those areas of your business or anything else?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think our results for the Q1 suggest that we haven't felt any impact from that. Again, if you are a provider, if you've lived in this world for a long time, it's just another day at the office, it's not I think as meaningful as it is to the layperson who doesn't understand how the business works.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then on the capital structure, obviously now, with the AMR deal done, you're at 4.2 times debt-to-EBITDA, can we talk a little bit about where would you like to see that number go? Are you comfortable in the 4 times, 4.5 times range?","And what about the capital priorities, assuming you pursue your strategic plan? I think its $400 million of targeted acquisition spend, is there any other priorities and do you still think you'll do the $400 million of acquisition spend?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. A.J. I think we'll continue to pursue that $400 million in acquisition spend. Cash flow will certainly pick up; it always does in the back half of the year. We'll put that to work towards acquisition and de-levering. And so, our target is low-4s, trying to get it around that range and hopefully sub-4 (43:56) soon thereafter as we move into 2019.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And A.J, with respect to the capital deployment, as I said, in my comments, the pipeline is still very robust. I had attended a large conference week or so ago, had over 550 private equity and other entities there that are interested in learning more about Physician Services and ASCs.","Clearly well attended, lot of interest in the space. It's just a hot topic right now. And I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. The good news for us is that we have \u2013 we're in a very enviable position to be very selective, to really focus on deploying our cash and our capital strategically, in line with the vision that we've outlined. So, we feel very good about that. We don't feel any pressure at all to do anything, but deploy the capital very efficiently.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And maybe one last question. You highlighted in the press release, and then, again, on your comments this morning the turnaround at Evolution Health. I know the focus has been first on stabilizing and get into a profitable state. Can you just tell us now that you have that, where do you think you're going to go with that business?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We do. We changed out the leadership middle of last year. Mike Parsons (45:37) is doing a great job of leading that organization. They've really improved their overall operating focus and controls, launched a sales process. They're working very closely with our partners, our not-for-profit and for-profit joint venture partners there, he has a great strategy and they're off to a great start in 2018.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Chris, just going back to Gary's question earlier, as we think about new contract growth versus contract attrition, what are you seeing there? What are you expecting, especially on the attrition side, number one?","And then, what are the discussions like with the hospitals today considering the fairly public fight that you've had, so to speak, with United? How are hospitals viewing what's going on there in terms of the discussions you're having?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, probably, again, no surprise to anyone, we have a tremendous amount of support amongst our brethren on the provider side to bring a voice into the conversation and to try to create these reforms that we're talking about. Everyone is \u2013 even on the payor side, we're all struggling with the same issues. And we want it to be easier than it is today. So, really, we get a lot of support in those conversations.","And probably more importantly, we get a lot of support for the drive to in-network. Because we all \u2013 I think we all share the same motivation. We want to do right by the patient. The patients today are not happy with the system. I'm being honest about it. It's too hard to navigate and the billing procedures and processes are too cumbersome. And they want a more seamless experience and that's what we're all trying to accomplish.","And then, with respect to what we think long-term \u2013 and I think I've said this from the beginning of the \u2013 since we announced the merger and then over the last several quarters, the goal is to reduce the attrition rate over time. And I believe that will happen, as we continue to build the trust in our solutions and also how those solutions work together. Also keep in mind now with MACRA\/MIPS and other technology requirements, there's a little higher switching costs in today's market. So, for all of those reasons, I think you'll see more stability and more longevity over the long haul. So, that's really my view on where that's headed.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Chris, just to be clear, in your contract to the hospitals, is there any specific language on your status with the payors that could put you in breach with any of these relationships or agreements?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","There can be. There's no one rule for all the contracts, but what's really important here, Brian, is that we always have those conversations. That is a team effort with your customer. You don't make those decisions in a vacuum. So, I think that sometimes gets lost in the translation.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Appreciate that, Chris. Last question for me, as we think about anesthesiology contracting, are you seeing any push from the hospitals to insource this or are you still seeing a push to outsource? Just because I think there's a situation (49:37) in North Carolina where they're saying that the hospital is looking to in-source. What are your views on that?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We really haven't seen a major trend towards insourcing. That's very difficult. You have to build \u2013 for the health system provider, they would have to build a whole new competency. And many have gone down that road before and have the scars to prove it. So, we don't see that happening very often.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Cool. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to new contracts. You can certainly understand the lumpiness of gross adds, but I'm assuming you have more visibility on the terminations, since I believe some of it is self-inflicted. So, shouldn't that percentage just come down as you comp out some of those terms? And then, maybe can you help on how you see the margin profile around the new business wins coming on versus the margin profile of the business churning off.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, I think you raise a good point that we should bring out is that, again, Patrick and his team have done a great job over the past year of really focusing on the quality of the new contracts and the pro forma testing of those.","As I like to tell the group internally, the most important part of the marriage is the engagement and making sure that we get it right on the front end. And they've done a very good job on that front, which should lend itself to the waterfall that you outlined, meaning we should have higher retention. We should have better quality contracts. Any of the attrition that might happen in 2018 and 2019 will flow from the work that Brian Jackson and Karey are working on to bring up the bottom of our contracts that are sub optimized right now. And they've already done a great job in just the last two quarters in making progress on that. So, I hope that answers your question, happy to answer any follow-on to that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, just the terminations again, I mean, I'm assuming you have visibility. I think you had talked about yourselves sort of pushing some of the terms, and I think a bolus of those last year. So, as you comp that out, shouldn't that drive down the termination percentage?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, I think you're already seeing that, to some degree.","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Right. And I think the terms that we'll be rolling through or anniversarying on the back half of the year, they did have a low margin profile. And so, I think we should see improvement on the net new contract margins because of that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then I think you said you had 44 new contracts with about two-thirds to existing partners, so call around 30. Seems like the cross-sell is going pretty well. I was just hoping you can give us a little bit of sense of pipeline there. And has it been more success in getting anesthesia into your ER accounts or more ER into your legacy anesthesia contracts? Thanks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, the reality is that emergency medicine and hospital medicine has a higher churn in the marketplace. And so that's been the most successful within the suite of solutions. Anesthesia takes a little bit more, has a longer sales cycle, little trickier to turn that over as fast. So, I would say that it has \u2013 I think that it's happened \u2013 our trend has been consistent with what you would see overall in the mix of services in the marketplace.","That \u2013 and that \u2013 where we've had our success and why our growth rate's so much higher is that we've been able to sell into existing relationships, where we already have a trust with that customer. I've said also that while I like that statistic, the white space is gigantic. There's still a significant number of \u2013 larger health systems out there where we have a very small relationship today and that's another area that we'd really like to grow. So, I'd like to report that we grow internally with our existing customers, I'd be equally happy to report that we had a disproportionate growth in the white space as well.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC capital. Please go ahead.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. I was hoping \u2013 you referenced this in your last answer, but maybe if you could look back and when we think about guidance for the year and the ramp in the second half of the year, could you sort of walk us through some of the biggest drivers, the biggest needle-movers to actually achieving or maybe even exceeding that guidance. I think you just mentioned some of these contracts rolling off, some of these terminations, but maybe walk through the different pieces of synergies and any other factors that give you that confidence in that second half ramp? Thanks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Sure. Obviously the biggest one is the \u2013 that we've spoken to many times is the cost initiative, that is back half loaded, and I think that's clear in the guidance in how we address that with this call. We obviously have M&A, is in our guidance, so we have \u2013 we've committed about one-third of our target so far this year. New sales we've talked about, off to a very good start there for the year. And then after that it really comes down to the organic growth rate, which we \u2013 I think we spoke to in the last call, we don't think we were heroic in those projections, and we obviously had a good start to the first quarter of this year.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And when you think about those costs, like, what are the biggest \u2013 if you had to prioritize some largest needle-moving items, is it the cost side? And if it is within the cost bucket, what are the critical areas that really give you the confidence in that ramp.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Frank. I think the way Karey and his team built the ramp is in terms of visibility, achievability, really control, beginning with the low-hanging fruit, obviously, the corporate overhead, then moving into the rev cycle. These are areas where we can clearly executive. I think the back half is more loaded around what Brian, Karey, Phillip need to do on the clinical labor side. We want to give ourselves the opportunity to get the processes and tools in place to make sure we can execute on that. And we didn't take any \u2013 again, we didn't try to accelerate that too aggressively in the ramp, in order to give us time to build to that in the back half.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And then over on the DSO side, a little bit of a tick up that you described, but I'm just curious with this goal of in-network migration, should we really see much of a move in DSO over the balance of the year as this progression continues?","And then one, just a clarification, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly on this strategic review process. Did I hear you right to say that you would have some kind of announcement or resolution, whatever it is, by the end of the current quarter? Thanks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think the words we said were second quarter, that we would identify something in the second quarter. I think, Frank, the press release is pretty explicit on that. Probably won't go much beyond what the press release says there for reasons that you well understand. And then, on the DSO side, Kevin did a good job of enumerating the three biggest drivers, but I appreciate the way you asked the question.","We are making some significant improvements and changes to our revenue cycle inside of the company, and that can take some time to really bear fruit in terms of your cash production and your DSOs and putting your tracking in place. I don't know that I would expect a significant move downward on the DSOs in the very near term. I am 100% confident that the moves that we're making around the revenue cycle are needed. They're the right thing to do and they're going to help differentiate us for the long term. Other question?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi, thanks, good morning. First question, just taking a step back on the ASCs and \u2013 in terms of the trends that you guys are seeing relative to what we're seeing in the industry, EBITDA's down, I understand there's weather and there's flu-related stuff, but revenue weakness, ASC count not really growing, were down a little bit with the de-consolidations. And I guess, I'm just curious is it more a factor of procedure mix and heavy GI? Or what do you think is causing that difference relative to what we're seeing in the market?","And then, sorry for the long question, but are you having more conversations with health systems? Are there any health plans out there that you're having conversations with? Thanks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","On the ASC side, I think that the flu and the weather did matter in the quarter and does explain the trending there. And I also believe that you're going to see some recovery from that in the second quarter. I think we'll be able to reschedule some of that. But at the end of the day, the value proposition for the surgery centers is indisputable. They do a great job on providing high-quality care. I think they still have runway for growth and expansion, and I remain very bullish on that story.","On the last question, you asked me was around the \u2013 other conversations with health plans, and I think I've spoken to that in my comments to this point. We have numerous ongoing negotiations and discussions at any given time. So, the answer is, yes, we have a lot of that, and we always have a run rate of those discussions underway at any given moment.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Got you, Got you. On the Physician Services, is it possible to strip out flu and give us sort of a volume and rate number excluding the flu?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think it's somewhat difficult to do. I think probably, approximately maybe one-third of the overall Physician Services revenue could be attributable \u2013 of the growth itself could be attributable to the flu. So, we had good volumes and rate across the board, and also in specialties too. So, what we saw in same contract wasn't necessarily driven specifically just by the flu.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Got you. And obviously, would rate be 1 point or 2 points higher ex-flu? Is that the way to think about it?","Kevin D. Eastridge - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think rate did have an impact. It's hard to say what it would be on a normalized basis without it though.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Got you. And then just last question on the acquisitions, I think it's still contributing north of 8% of your growth. You guys continue to talk about the $400 million and being acquisitive, so I'm curious, and it seems like it's mostly on the Physician Services. I'm curious valuations in that market, have they become more attractive? And then putting yourselves in the shoes of the sellers, what do you think is motivating the sellers in the market?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think the sellers are \u2013 are you speaking about Physician Services, Josh?","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Yeah, mostly on that side, that's accurate.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","No, that's a great question. And I think, again, I spoke to this in the merger thesis. It's just very difficult \u2013 let me back up. Most of Physician Services today are small micro businesses, they're small business owners. And they recognize that the payors are consolidating, the health systems are consolidating, there's a lot of demand for IT, regulatory upkeep, HR, recruiting, there's just a long litany of things that are very difficult for them to sustain their businesses.","So, becoming part of something larger, again, to get that voice is very important, and I think that's what the seller see is the need to drive size and scale in order to survive. That's what I think is driving them and motivating them.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","All right. That's perfect. Thank you, Chris.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","All right. I think we're past the hour. I'm sorry I can't get to everyone's questions here, but would very much like to thank you all for joining us on the call today. And I hope you have a great day and great rest of the week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Now, I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Craig Wilson, General Counsel. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Craig A. Wilson - Secretary, Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Thank you. Welcome, everyone to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially. We encourage you to read the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed in the coming days.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon, along with our remarks today, are made as of today, May 5, 2016. And, we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold. Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued this afternoon, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website. All comparisons included in our presentation today are for the 2016 period to the comparable period in 2015 unless otherwise noted.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Craig, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted in today's release, we reported an excellent start to 2016. We generated strong revenue growth. We see multiple opportunities for continued top line expansion. Margins on our existing businesses are improving and recently added businesses will continue to enhance profitability and margin expansion as they are integrated to our operations.","For the quarter Envision's net revenue grew by 28% to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 18% to $151.6 million. Adjusted Earnings per share were $0.28. And, cash flow from operations of $89.6 million was nearly double when compared to the same period last year. All in, these are solid results that reflect a strategic and operating focus across the enterprise.","At EmCare when excluding Evolution Health revenue grew by 15% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 18% resulting in 30 basis points of margin expansion over the prior period. Contract margins continue to improve as a result of adherence to our contracting guidelines, elimination of underperforming contracts, and leveraging technology. Our enhanced use of technology is also contributing to efficiencies by giving us better visibility to staffing and volumes on a real-time basis.","Our EmCare pipeline continues to be robust as demonstrated by new contracts adding 8% points to our revenue growth in the quarter. On the M&A front, our focus is driven by our market-centric strategy as evidenced by the recently completed acquisition of EPMG, a highly regarded provider group in Michigan. This acquisition further expands our provider network, and the scale and scope of services in this important region","Evolution Health continues its rapid top line growth with a 177% year-over-year increase. While first-quarter margins are lower than the full year 2016 expected margins due to the recent start-ups in the net new businesses. We fully anticipate achieving Evolution's target contract margins, as these relationships mature.","For example, in our Ascension Health joint venture, markets that we have added in 2015 have exceeded target margins as a result of implementing our Medical Command Center technology and care pathways into the Ascension Program. Looking forward, we continue to expand our relationship with Ascension. They will be adding a number of new markets in the second quarter including Michigan.","As it relates to Michigan, the acquisition of EPMG combined with our relationship with Ascension and other health systems give us an expanded platform for integrated service offerings in that important region.","As it relates to new business opportunities for Evolution, interest on health systems and health plans remain strong. We believe that these emerging opportunities will be realized in the latter part of this year.","Moving to AMR, our primary focus is on the integration of Rural\/Metro and the expansion of our system contracts. Our integration efforts will continue throughout the year. On the business development front, AMR continues to differentiate its service offerings as evidenced by the signing of new health systems and new 911 contracts. We recently started services with Summa Health in Ohio, the University of Maryland System and two new 911 relationships including the District of Columbia. When choosing an ambulance provider, health systems in municipalities are focused on companies that can demonstrate quality, a comprehensive scale, scope and services and an expanded geographic footprint. I'm now going to segue and take a few minutes to address an issue that's getting a lot of attention lately. And that is the out-of-network service and balance billing legislation.","There are many state and federal initiatives underway that protect patients from balance billing and establish a fair process to determine the adequate reimbursement to providers. We are encouraged by the position many states are taking on this issue. For example, Florida's recent legislation, which is modeled after the New York law sets forth a process for payment, that is based on objective standards. We are strongly in support of this direction and believe the momentum that we have seen in Florida and other states will codify a process that will establish reasonable payments for our service and remove uncertainty.","In addition, we believe this current approach ensures that we will have an adequate revenue stream to satisfy contractual commitments to deliver high quality patient care and maintain margins. Now keep in mind, that we do consult with hospitals and hospital partners as part of any decision to be in- or out-of-network.","Now, before turning call over to Randy, I'd like to thank our 50,000-plus associates for the continued commitment to making a difference in the lives of patients we serve and to congratulate all Envision employees on being named \u2013 with Envision being named as Fortune Magazine's most admired companies in the industry. Randy?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon. We reported strong results from operations for the first quarter 2016 with excellent top line and adjusted EBITDA growth and strong cash flow from operations largely the result of improved DSOs. I'll quickly walk through our financial results for the quarter as well as our increased outlook for 2016.","Envision's revenue in the quarter grew by 28.4% from the prior year to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 17.6% to $151.6 million. Envision's EBITDA margin of 9.5% declined by 90 basis points from the prior-year period, which reflects the initial lower margins of business started or acquired in the fourth quarter 2015.","This includes our population health management contract for Evolution and AMR's acquisition of Rural\/Metro, EmCare's margin when excluding post-acute business through Evolution improved by 30 basis points. Net income of $26.9 million compares to $33.4 million for the prior-year period and was impacted by higher depreciation and amortization expense as well as increased interest expense related to acquisition in 2015.","Adjusted EPS for Q1 of 2016 was $0.28 compared to $0.26 cents for Q1 of 2015. Fully diluted GAAP EPS was $0.14 compared with GAAP EPS of $0.17 for the first quarter of 2015.","EmCare's total revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 22.8%, which is comprised of 15% growth related to our hospital-based physician services, and 177% for our population health management and post-acute services through our Evolution Health brand.","Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months contributed 14.6 percentage points of growth while organic revenue growth was 8.2%. Organic growth in the period is further broken down, as same-store growth of 5.2% and 3% from net new business. Same-store revenue growth calculated on a comparable same-store revenue basis was 6.8% and was driven by strong volume growth of 6.9%. Volume growth at EmCare's largest service line, emergency services, was 4.2%, which was better than our initial expectations.","In addition, same-store volume growth was strong for our hospitalist and radiology service lines. Same-store revenue per visit for the quarter declined by 10 basis points. Physician services revenue per visit grew by 20 basis points and was offset by a 30-basis point decline due to a reduction in our Medicare home health rate of 1.4% at Evolution Health.","The increase in rate per visit for physician services is due to higher commercial reimbursement, offset by slightly lower rates from Medicare. We're seeing modest commercial rate increases as a part of our normal payer negotiations.","Net new business growth of 3% is attributable to new business in our Evolution post-acute services including our population health management contract in Florida, started late last year, and our expanding joint venture relationship with Ascension Health. When excluding the impact of our post-acute services through our Evolution Health, EmCare's revenue from net new contracts declined by 2.2%.","New contracts added 8.1% in growth from a continued robust sales pipeline offset by terminations of 10.3%. The higher level of terminations was driven by our focused effort to exit underperforming contracts, including a full quarter's impact of contract terminations that happened during the fourth quarter 2015.","As we progress throughout the year, we expect the impact from terminations will be reduced, returning to positive net new sales growth by the end of the year. Net new contract adds will also enhance overall margins compared to contracts that we terminate.","We restructured our relationship with the Baylor Health System in Texas in the first quarter to a management services, or MSA, agreement, in which providers are employed by a third party and we provide management and administrative support services. The contract restructure had an impact of reducing physician services revenue by approximately 3.4% in the first quarter. MSA arrangements result in a lower revenue and lower cost of service, but higher EBITDA margin percentage. MSAs have been and we expect will remain a small part of the contracts that we manage.","EmCare's adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $87.3 million or 8.6% of segment revenue, including a loss of $400,000 in our Evolution post-acute services. When excluding Evolution Health, EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was $87.7 million or 9.7% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA in our hospital-based physician services grew by 18.4%, resulting in a 30-basis point improvement in margins.","I also want to add some information on the discussion around out-of-network and balance billing that Bill just noted. While there are recent questions raised on the matter, it's been a part of our business for a long time and is primarily related to our ED services. It's important to re-emphasize that when we are out-of-network with a payer, this approach is negotiated with our hospital partners upfront and throughout the life of the contract. In these discussions, hospitals identify which payers they want us to be in network with. Oftentimes, we're also out-of-network with payers during a renegotiation process.","It's also important to know that we do not pursue a strategy of balance billing patients and for the most part, we do not balance bill our patients. Collections from balance billing of patients represents less than 1% of EmCare's collections.","Our post-acute services through our Evolution Health brand generated first quarter revenue of $107.4 million, an increase of 177% from the prior year. We had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $400,000 for the quarter, driven by the start-up of the population health management contract that we started in Florida late last year. That contract was launched with a very intense period of patient engagement, essentially reaching out to members of EMA plan to educate them on how to utilize health services more effectively. The outreach period was at its peak in the first quarter.","During the initial phase of the contract our medical claims expense is based on the payer's historical utilization trends. While we expect that it will take time to modify patient behavior, our initial metrics demonstrate positive trends in utilization. And there's a natural lag in the validation of the savings generated, which we believe will be reflected in lower medical claims expense over time. The development of this relationship is fairly consistent with new business coming in initially at lower margins and improving over time.","We also just completed adding the Michigan market to the Ascension joint venture, which along with an expansion of markets in Wisconsin, is expected to add approximately $85 million in annual net revenue beginning in the second quarter.","AMR's revenue grew by 39.4% to $584.7 million with a full quarter contribution of the Rural\/Metro acquisition. Contributions from all acquisitions completed in the last 12 months accounted for 36.3% of AMR's growth while organic growth contributed 3.1%. Same market volume grew by 4.5% while rate declined by 2.1%. The rate decline was from a change in transport mix, as we have seen an increase in the percentage of our non-emergency transport services and changes to a service model and more 911 contract in California.","In that contract, we now bill the county for our services as opposed to billing third-party payers reducing the revenue yield but offset by expense reduction. Net new contract growth for the quarter was 0.7% and we expect that rate to accelerate based on recently announced new contract growth as Bill noted earlier.","Adjusted EBITDA on AMR of $64.3 million grew by 24.1% and the margin was 11%. Our margin declined from 12.3% last year. This is due to the impact of Rural\/Metro on AMR's blended margins. AMR's margins were consistent for the first quarter of 2016 versus the prior-year. As previously noted, Rural\/Metro margins were in the high single-digits prior to integration and synergy savings.","We're making good progress on integrating that acquisition into AMR. While we've achieved some initial synergies, most of the synergies are expected in the back half of this year into the first of next year as we integrate their operations and enhance their revenue cycle process.","We had strong cash flow during the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $89.6 million, which is up 98% from the prior-year period and 65% sequentially. Cash flow improved as a result of higher EBITDA as well as working capital improvement.","Our DSOs for Envision declined by two days year-over-year and by three days on a sequential basis. DSOs declined sequentially for each of our EmCare, Evolution and AMR businesses.","Adjusted free cash flow also grew significantly. It was $62.9 million in the first quarter, up 69% from the prior-year period. Free cash flow was impacted by higher CapEx of $39.1 million during the first quarter relative to last year's period, which was $13.5 million.","The higher CapEx supports AMR's growth, specifically a number of new contracts that we announced in March as well as expected capital investments related to the Rural\/Metro acquisition. At March 31, we had cash on hand of $191.7 million, which is up by $50 million from the end of 2015 and total debt was $3 billion.","In our press release this afternoon, we updated our outlook for all of 2016, increasing our expectations for adjusted EBITDA to $725 million to $750 million. This update primarily reflects the expected contributions of the EPMG acquisition completed in mid-April.","Throughout the remainder of 2016, we do expect sequential adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion for each of the remaining three quarters. Just as a reminder, while the seasonal FICA tax expense has the most pronounced impact on our first quarter results, we continue to be impacted by higher FICA tax expense in the second quarter before many other providers on our payroll reached the threshold during that period.","FICA tax expense in the first quarter is approximately $30 million higher than in the fourth quarter 2015. FICA tax expense in the second quarter will decline by approximately 40% of that Q1 amount. We've also increased our outlook for the full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.54.","Operator, at this point we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question about the guidance. I see, originally, you provided annual guidance and you kind of took down your thoughts on Q1 on a weak flu season, your Q1 looks like you actually kind of hit maybe at least the midpoint to the higher end of the original assumption for Q1 EBITDA. And I just wanted to see, because I guess when you revised the guidance initially on Q1 it kind of implied the back half of the year was going to be better than your initial guidance assumed. Now, you've hit your original Q1 guidance. And I'm not sure I guess why the guidance isn't going up by the outperformance in Q1 plus the deals? Is it just conservatism or is there something else going on that makes you think about the second half of the year?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Kevin, I wouldn't take any, I guess, negative into that in terms of how we think about \u2013 how the year may progress. I think we were trying to be conservative. It's early in the year. We don't typically do big changes in guidance early in the year. Remember, we did say that acquisitions have not been included and that we were going to include that and that's really what we try to do here.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So it's just purely just up for the deal and nothing else going on.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, for the most part. Yeah, you bet.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess just a second question, I guess there has been all this focus on out-of-network and everything else, are you seeing anything, I mean, it's one of these things where it feels like the Street is more aware of it, but I guess, from a market perspective, is there anything that you're seeing where you say, yeah, there actually is more focus on it either from the payers or from the hospital partners around this issue that makes you think that there would be an impact on the business over time?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Kevin, it's Randy. Look, no not really. Again, this has been for us, part of our business for as I said a long period of time. We've always felt like that over the long-term, you would have more movement toward, in network. But what we've seen is even where we had those negotiations on a regular basis with different payers like that we are able to negotiate a rate that's favorable and that allows us to have enough revenue to properly service the contract and what the hospital needs.","And I think the most important thing that we try to say here is that, again, we and the hospital really are aligned, right? We do have a little of this. It's a very important to them maybe to have certain payers in network and we do that. So that's a discussion that we have upfront and throughout the life of the contract.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Kevin, this is Bill. You know the activity has been actually more on the provider side, because we are actually quite encouraged with the position some of the states are taking and whether those include not only balance billing but state-mandated mediation for dispute resolution, is a very encouraging movement that we think is going to get traction. We know it really started off in New York and is moving quickly to other states. So, I think you are seeing more activity from providers pushing this legislation because it really takes out the uncertainty of overall compensation for physicians.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you see this as a neutral to a positive thing?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I believe so.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions and all the color. Obviously, some nice improvement ex Evolution in the core EmCare business. So, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about Project Horizon and how that's been rolling out? Maybe, how much of the improvement here is a benefit from that versus just other things like anesthesia billing getting back on track, et cetera?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Bill and good afternoon. I think it's a combination of factors. Project Horizon, for those of you who may not recall when we first introduced the notion back in Q4, really identified looking at our processes within EmCare and going through a lead methodology to improve the operations.","Many items were identified. We have not fully implemented any of them, frankly, with the exception of the use of technology to identify real-time volume and staffing hours. I think we'll see the benefit of Project Horizon come to us in the latter part of the year.","And it's a lot of investments in technology to better identify and better \u2013 we decreased our DSO as well. So, I would say that the improvement you see in Q1 and EmCare is primarily keeping their nose to the grindstone on operations.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Ryan, this is Randy. One other \u2013 you asked about anesthesia. I would say that we are seeing improvements obviously in the billing process as we made changes last year and later in the year. We've not seen a major change in how we recognize revenue. We want to see that mature and see the cash come through. So, I do think there is some opportunity there, but we've not made any sort of major changes or increases to the revenue recognition on the anesthesia at this point.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a different topic, Evolution obviously continued great growth there. Any update on what you're seeing on your dashboard either in the Florida MA population or BPCI \u2013 I don't think they've gone through reconciliation yet. They've delayed that. But kind of what are your thoughts internally as you look at kind of key metrics, readmissions, and things that would drive potential savings? Thanks.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Bill, again. Let's talk first about the health plan relationship. Keep in mind that we actually signed the agreement in November. And as you are managing medical loss spend or medical spend, it takes time for that to mature. At the same time, we do track all the key metrics that are important to improving the overall care of the patient as well as metrics related to utilization.","Those early indications \u2013 and I will emphasize the word early \u2013 have been quite favorable. And so we fully expect, as this relationship matures that we turn the corner pretty quickly and we see the benefits of lower medical loss ratios, particularly in the areas of service in which we provide, which includes emergency care, inpatient care, post-acute care and transportation.","As it relates to BCPI, we really didn't recognize any benefit in Q1, primarily because of the uncertainty with CMS. If you follow it closely, there has been some difficulty matching physicians to the TIN numbers. The whole notion of how CMS works with the matching of the PICOs (26:35) \u2013 we are uncertain as to whether or not that's been fully vetted out. They have come out and they said they will not hold any organization or provider to a negative and are considering \u2013 looking at positive for a while. So until that shakes out, I think we are just going to stay neutral, continue to manage those patients, but not book any profitability.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And to your point, until they do the reconciliation, you really need that data point. So...","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the strong start to the year. Thanks.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Sorry to go back to the out-of-network question. But, I just want to understand, it sounds like balance bill is less than 1% of collections, so clearly that's not a major focus of yours. But I do want to understand, what percentage of your business is actually out-of-network? And how do we quantify sort of the rate differential, because I assume that kind of flows to EBITDA. So if you think about Florida legislation perhaps one day becoming national legislation where the rate gets set, I'm just trying to figure out where you are today versus where that rate would be and if there's any sort of offset on the EBITDA side?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I will start off and then I'll ask Randy to add to the comments. Let's just stick with Florida. We know that at least as the legislation has been completed and the bill now is law, that we believe based on the process in Florida, to reconcile we will have either a neutral or a positive. I think it's leaning more towards a positive. Every state is a little bit different.","But we're very encouraged by the fact that many states are looking very seriously at utilizing the FAIR Health database to come up with these rates, which is really the most robust database in the country with over 19 billion claims. And as such, we feel very encouraged and have been very actively involved in the process of working with states to finalize the process of dispute resolution.","So I guess the long and short of it, as we said earlier, we think as this progresses throughout the country, slowly but surely, about half of them already have out-of-network and balance billing laws on the books, we believe it will at worst be neutral, but perhaps some positive on a go-forward basis. Randy you want to add to that at all?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Josh, a couple of things. So one, when you look at \u2013 again, emergency room is really where you see more of that historically and again, the important thing here first is understanding that that's a relationship with the hospital that we are both aligned on.","But if you look at really the \u2013 kind of what you would really call, sort of, out-of-network at any point in time \u2013 and again that may fluctuate depending on what negotiations you are doing or whatever else, it's probably around 20% of our EmCare ED collections \u2013 our commercial collections. And so it's really \u2013 and again it is higher, you do see higher rates. It varies again by that. It's not as much as people think and we really haven't gotten into specific sort of rate differences.","But \u2013 again, as we've said, there has been concern about that. But, again, aligned with the hospital, we don't see that as a significant risk. And historically, it's not been a significant risk because we've been able to \u2013 when a hospital wants us to go in-network we are able to have that discussion and make sure that whether it's through that or with other payers or with assistance from the hospital to make sure that the revenue that we have is adequate to maintain that contract. So we really do not see this as a risk point.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So that actually is very helpful, that number. So 20% of your EmCare ED collections are out-of-network and obviously you get a little \u2013 you get a higher rate, but we would assume \u2013 whatever, just pick my number, let's say the rate is 30% higher, it would be 30% of the 20% of EmCare, and how much of EmCare overall is ED?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It's about 75%, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And that's excluding Evolution?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Correct. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah, excluding Evolution.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So even a little bit lower than that.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, correct. Correct.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Now I'm done with that. So next question, just on the operating expense line, that came in a little bit higher \u2013 there was some movement, SG&A a little bit lower, so I don't know, maybe I just had the buckets wrong. But was there anything particular in the operating expenses? Is that where Evolution is hitting, some of the new stuff?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It really is more of a geography thing. If you look at the \u2013 especially you see it in the EmCare segment numbers, it's really the Florida plan. Most of that expense is not comp expense, it's provider network expense, which is included in operating expense.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon. So you obviously had strong revenue trends, but maybe any help on the margin side, I know 1Q is obviously seasonally weaker, it came in a little bit lower than what we've seen even on sort of 1Q and I know you talked about Evolution and the drag from deals. I guess the question is how quickly can you improve that and then maybe over what period of timeframe, and then maybe any help with where you think sort of normalized margins for the business is at this point once we're sort of fully mature with the different segments? Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, it really is. If you look at, I think what we tried to communicate \u2013 hopefully we did was when you look at \u2013 if you take EmCare the physician service component putting Evolution Health aside, we really did see some margin improvement. And obviously margins in Q1 are lower, it's a seasonal thing, we've always had than Q4 because of the payroll tax. And I mentioned Q4 to Q1 we paid $30 million more in payroll tax. It's a big change but it happens every year. So EmCare really had a really nice margin improvement.","I think we've talked before about we anticipate that EmCare, even with a slightly lower organic growth, would have more margin improvement probably in the range of 70 basis points to 80 basis points through the year and we still believe that we are on track to see that. I think on the Evolution Health side we have talked about before that while we clearly see, and Bill mentioned that when contracts come in so for \u2013 in the Ascension example where they come in at low margin. We've really seen some substantial margin improvement as we've been able to integrate our processes and those mature.","So we do expect margin growth but we have so much new business that we still expect Evolution itself to be more in that probably close to that mid-single-digit margin range for the year. Again that will improve some just because of the amount of new business that we have. AMR, we mentioned again, was I guess, let's call it maybe legacy AMR business excluding Rural\/Metro was about 12.3% margin. It was pretty stable with what it was last year. So that was positive. Rural\/Metro we've talked before was a lower margin business. So, it drags sort of a blended margin, which makes it look like it's a decline here, but it's really more about the business mix. And so clearly we expect Rural\/Metro margins to improve. We've talked about that through both synergy and realization of synergies you know that will take about half of those we'd realized this year and then a full amount in 2017 as well as opportunities to improve some of their margins and existing contracts.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then, do you have a target in terms of consolidating margins? Do you think they can ultimately get back up to kind of that 11% range? Or is that not how we should we thinking?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, no, I think that's fair.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And remember again, remember there is always sequential margin improvement throughout the year \u2013 again in large part because of the payroll tax issue, and as the new businesses mature, improving those margins.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair. And then just a follow-up, I just wanted to talk about pricing a little bit, flat on the EmCare side, any drag from parity I guess? And then AMR was down, so I know you talked a little bit about in the call, hoping you can sort of just flush that out a bit for us?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so again, let me just make sure. So on the pricing side, EmCare if you look at the physician services side again we had about a 20-basis point improvement in pricing, more of that's from sort of commercial, I think, where we had some improvement. So it's not a significant increase. We've said before we think we're in a fairly sort of stable sort of pricing environment at the moment. On the AMR side, again, it was really a function of just two things here.","One is, obviously Rural\/Metro rates have been a little smaller than the AMR rates just because of geography and where they've been. And we've been adding a lot of business in the non-emergency transport sector, lot of new contracts with inter-facility and with health systems and just its more of a mix of that business. So we mentioned the one contract in California, again it was more of just the structure of the contract where we now bill the county and they bill the patients and so there was just a natural change to that that affected the overall blend. But otherwise, it's pretty stable.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe first of all, I know you make reference, you gave us the details on the emergency room growth when you referenced it radiology and hospitalist did better than that, is there any color on what you are seeing in EmCare beyond just the traditional ER and where the strength is coming from?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","A.J., I would just say that, if you look at sort of hospitalist and radiology, those were really in sort of the double-digit volume growth. I think hospitalist is really just a function of \u2013 there's just a lot of growth and in programs that we have there's an increase in the use of hospitalist and growing those programs once we start that. So I think, it's more a function of expanding the programs once the hospital sees what we can do. And nothing specific \u2013 radiology is still pretty small for us so nothing sort of stuck out there.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Now, you keep in mind that utilization by hospitalist and procedures by hospitalists are directly proportion to inpatient admissions and so we saw this Q1 strong inpatient admissions and you can expect that you would see increase in procedures and also patients seen by hospitalists that goes up.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just ask a little further on Evolution Health. Obviously, you are ramping up with some of the high profile customers you got. Ascension sounds like it's going well. Can you maybe step back from those in-house ones and what kind of discussions are you having out there in the market? Is the interest in potentially working with Evolution is still very robust?","And I know there was a time when we were talking about managed care guys working with you to help manage the utilization review, the hospital is looking at you from a perspective of managing readmissions and then we've obviously got all the discussion around CCJR and other bundled payment initiatives. Tell us what kind of things Evolution is getting to look at and maybe update us on the nature of the discussions.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I'll take that in two parts, A.J. The first as it relates to hospital systems \u2013 and I say hospital systems, because we don't do a lot of work through Evolution with single hospitals. As it relates to systems, we're very actively working with systems to help them manage their bundled payment programs.","And we've done a really good job of being able to stack the resources that we have in the market. By stacking, I mean we have post-acute care clinicians in the market that work collaboratively with our hospital systems for inpatient management of BCPI.","So we're able to utilize these resources effectively. The second item, in which or the second area, in which we work collaboratively with hospital systems, if they are looking for a post-acute care strategy either under a bundled payment arrangement or under some form of insurance products with ACO, we will be the post-acute care provider for them.","So those are two areas as it relates to health systems that we're in discussions with the Evolution, and we've got a very, very robust pipeline as it relates to health systems. Health plans we spent a lot of time the last few years socializing the concept of what we can do relative to the services we provide.","We have a very large book of business probably twice the size of health systems of health plans that once you to take on services that we provide and do some risk sharing with us or upside sharing. We are slowly responding to those.","What we want to do is, to make sure that the early value that we're bringing to the Blue Cross in Florida; we can continue to demonstrate that. We will be publishing results of that soon. And we will quickly go into other health systems and also health plans. So we're very bullish about the growth. We want to manage the growth such that we can get those margins up more quickly.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. So, first question, on Rural\/Metro. As we think about the fact that now you guys are together, how should we think about the organic growth opportunity there considering that you used to win business away from them? And then, Randy, if you can just share some updates on where you are in terms of synergy realization, if that's on track and are there any challenges you are seeing there?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Before, Randy talks about synergy, let me talk to you about contract wins. As you know, as I stated in my early opening comments, what we are seeing and what we had not seen previously is a lot of health systems now wanting to contract with us is a overall health management of resources that systems want to look at. They are thinking more about the transportation and patient care as well as post-acute care.","Historically, they would contract or associate with a local provider, to work with them. What we're seeing now the big systems, like I described, in Cleveland or Akron, Ohio and the similar systems in University of Maryland, they're wanting a group that can not only provide distinct geographic area, but have competencies related to quality educators (42:54) and so we're very comfortable with the fact that we now have opened up a new market that historically has not been in our purview.","We know that as it relates to 911s, which are slow to come, frankly we don't believe there's anyone on a quality side and the resource side that compete with us. The whole reason the D.C. market went with us was the fact of our ability to demonstrate reduction in death rates and improve survival rates. So these are differentiators, I think will allow us to grow organically on a go-forward basis.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And Bill, you mentioned the D.C. contract, when does that start and do you mind sizing that for us?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It started I think about three weeks to four weeks ago and the size, off the top of my head \u2013 I'll be honest with you, I don't recall the size of it.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I don't either, off the top of my head.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then last one for me, contract visibility, how should we think about the churn or turnover in your existing EmCare contracts? I mean, is that starting to slow down? Or are we still seeing the same pace of contract turnover?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I think \u2013 this is Randy \u2013 if you look at contract churn, okay? It is slowing down, okay? There is no \u2013 we definitely see that. But remember, when a contract terminates, so like the contracts that we discussed before that terminated in Q4, they show up as terminations for four quarters before they roll-off.","So when you look at 2016, you will continue to see a higher level of terminations than we've seen historically until they roll off. But when you look at actual new terminations, we are definitely seeing a reduction of that and got through some of the more problematic contracts that we discussed before.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks guys.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Since every other analyst violated the one question rule, I guess, I'll violate it and ask you a couple. Even starting from the get go, everybody just broke the rules. I just want to make sure, one, I want to understand the disclosure, I think I do, but when we look at EmCare, organic revenue growth 5.2% and then you talk about same-store comparable revenue growth 6.8%, so the 1.6%, is that just the impact of the net contract exits, that difference?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, no. Gary, I'm glad you asked, because it's \u2013 the 5.2% is based on total EmCare revenue, right? In terms of just looking at sort of that 8% \u2013 the 5.2% was same-store and then obviously 3% net new. The 6.8% that we talked about is really a different denominator, right? Just taking the same-store revenue growth against the same-store base, okay? So, it's just a function of that same-store base versus the total revenue base.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so can you remind, on an annualized basis, how much contracts have you exited or what would be the impact year-over-year on the quarter from the contracts exited in 4Q?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well. So, if you look at, again, if you just look at on the EmCare excluding Evolution, okay?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","We had in the quarter 8% revenue growth from new contracts, okay, that have started, offset by 10.3% of previous terminations and the impact of previous terminations. So that was the negative 2.2% that we mentioned on actual terminations, the impact in the quarter, if that's what you're asking.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I guess, okay. I guess, I missed that or misunderstood it. Okay. And then, second question is, when we just \u2013 going back to revenue per encounter at EmCare, the negative 10-basis point year-over-year, there's a lot of factors in that, there is specialty mix, there is payer mix, there is acuity and then there is the commercial and government rate impacting that. So it sounds like you are saying that combined price increase, government and commercial, is relatively flat and then just year-over-year acuity payer mix and specialty all essentially had very little impact on that. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Yeah. And, so just to make sure, Gary, because again, there are a number of moving pieces here. So, first, when you look at that 10-basis point decline, again, 30 basis points of that was related to really Evolution Health, okay? And because there was a Medicare rate reduction on traditional home health business that's in Evolution Health. So if you put that aside, okay, the actual EmCare physician services component was a 20-basis point increase, okay? And that was really more of a function of just sort of a slight increase in rates. I mean it's fairly flat. We didn't see a big change in acuity or sort of mix, so it's more just a function of a rate change on the commercial business.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And finally, just longer term, thinking about at least what now is a fairly flat rate environment, you do have some variable cost inflation in the business, so are you \u2013 as you think longer term, do you think you will get rate growth commensurate with that? Do think you'll have to drive productivity gains to preserve margins if rates really aren't moving up? Do you think you have an opportunity to preserve margin by going back to hospitals and addressing subsidy or staffing levels, or all of the above?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think there's a little bit, Gary, of all the above. Again, if you go back, and you've followed us for a long time, the history is, we have some years \u2013 rate growth is fairly flat and then you see periods of where it is up sort of 2% to 3%. So it's on clearly the low-end of what I'd call the historical kind of range. And so we do, as you will recall, physician compensation in most contracts, there is some component of that that's tied to productivity. We clearly believe there is still opportunity for productivity gains. And so we feel pretty confident in our ability to increase EmCare margins from what we saw last year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon. I was hoping you could provide some color on the trends and uncompensated encounters in the quarter?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah Frank, there really wasn't, but I don't have that specific number in front of me. But we really didn't see any real big changes in sort of uncompensated care or uninsured sort of volume. So, I would say that really was not any big driver to sort of reimbursement changes.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then back on the discussion about the bundled service line offerings that you have. Just curious when you look at your new business wins how much of that are you really seeing in these multiple service lines? And then how much do you think is coming cross-selling new service lines into existing clients?","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","We still see on average about 35% to 40% even of our new contract starts offer an additional service with existing relationship. So, we have been seeing that range for some period of time and that's still continuing. It's primarily again emergency service and hospitalists are the ones that are the most common of the multiple services.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just one final which is a clarification, I think you made a comment earlier about half of states, was that half balance billing laws or half are looking opposing to have those kind of laws?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Half \u2013 this is Bill Sanger; half of the states have some form of legislation related to balance billing and out-of-networks. And, it varies depending upon the states.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And Frank, I do want to make sure, just because Josh had asked the question earlier, I just want to take a moment to make sure that my response is clear, we talked about \u2013 he asked about that out-of-network percentage and so when you look at commercial \u2013 commercial is about somewhere between 50% and 60% of total collections. Okay?","Of the commercial collections, the out-of-network is about 20% of the commercial collections. What we call in-network, which really includes contracts, directly with payers, and contracts with payers through intermediaries, that really is the bulk of the kind of commercial collections are those in-network. So, I just want to make \u2013 it wasn't 20% of total ED collections. It's 20% of the commercial collections. So, I just want to make sure that's clarified.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Randel G. Owen - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Tejus joining on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you share any color on acquisition multiples that you're seeing. I think you shared some comment last year and you've said they have come down a little bit, but curious what you're seeing on ER side versus hospitalists?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have not been inquiring a lot of single specialty practices. However, we're focused more on geographic-specific practices that have multiple service lines. For instance, ED practice, also has anesthesia, could have the hospitalists, could have ancillary-related services. And the larger practices are still going in the 9 to 11 range. I do believe the single practices have probably 1 to 1.5 turns lower than that. But we have not been pursuing the smaller single practices. Our focus has been on large geographic practices and those are in the 9 to 11 range.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up on the cost side. Can you comment on just the labor markets and anything you're seeing in terms of wage pressures or just attracting, retaining talent?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we \u2013 this question has come up almost on every earnings call. And things have not changed dramatically. There are some regional areas where there are pressures in terms of physician compensation, and they are spotty. We still have openings like most providers or most organizations employee providers do.","But last year, we quit over 2,100 clinicians and we're on track this year to recruit substantially more than that. We all have difficulty filling all the shifts all the time, but they do get filled. I haven't seen anything dramatic, any sea change that we're concerned about, at least in the near future.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. There are no pending questions in queue.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.

We are about to begin. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Kneeley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Robert Kneeley - Envision Healthcare Corp.","All right. Thank you, Camille, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Our presenters today are Chris Holden, CEO and President; Claire Gulmi, CFO; Bob Coward, President of Physician Services; and Randy Owen, President of Ambulatory Services.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. We encourage you to carefully read the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed earlier this year in addition to the risks and uncertainties described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we expect to file in the coming days.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon, along with our remarks on this call are made as of today, May 2, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued this afternoon, which is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chris Holden.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Bob. Welcome everyone to the call today and we're going to jump right into the comments and share with everyone that here as a team, we are laser focused on differentiating Envision Healthcare around our core physician-centric services. And to that end, we've already made great progress on many fronts and I look forward to sharing a few key highlights and accomplishments for the quarter ending March 31, 2017.","Our adjusted EPS of $0.77 is in line with our guidance and consensus. We continue to make significant progress on the strategic plan we outlined in our last call. Most notably, we've launched a formal process to reduce strategic alternatives for AMR and these that we've seen significant interest from many parties.","We expect to receive proposals in May and we anticipate resolving the process no later than year-end. For financial reporting purposes, we have now classified our Medical Transportation segment as discontinued operations. Claire will amplify the impact of this change in our financial reporting.","We've also made significant progress in the reengineering of our Evolution service line. And I'll say more about that in my discussion around physician services. We continue to stream line our operational focus on our core physician-centric segments and specifically, I think, we're on track to achieve our realizable synergies target for 2017. We've made significant progress migrating our ED service line to an in-network status. We've launched an internal program targeting performance improvement in our hospitalist service line and we've enhanced our focus on staffing and premium labor management best practices.","On the M&A front, our acquisition and development capital expenditures were $73 million for the quarter. We've completed transactions for three physician practice acquisitions and two ambulatory surgery centers.","Subsequent to quarter end, we made a significant step in the expansion of our radiology service with the addition of Imaging Advantage. We've now more than doubled our market position and performed over 13 million reads per year in total. Our pipeline remains very robust. There is a strong competition in the market for the marquee assets, particularly those significant platforms in physician services.","Our original forecast for 2017 contemplating closing of several transactions that were currently under LOI in Q2. We expect those deals to close, but we are experiencing some seller driven timing delays, and these delays are likely to impact our outlook for guidance on the remainder of the year. But irrespective of the timing issues, we expect to deploy our goal of $900 million in development capital for the year.","Now speaking to physician services, our revenue there increased 9.2% to $1.56 billion. Same contract revenue growth totaled 5%, 2.7% in rate and 2.3% in volume, solid results, was better than our expectations. Anesthesia had solid same-store growth and now is against a very high Q1 2016 comp. Children's services experienced negative same-store growth due to volume rate and acuity issues associated with a select few specific sites, primarily in South Florida and Arizona. We are muting our outlook for the children's service line for 2017 in our revised guidance. We initiated our new Envision services branding campaign in April and we launched the new envisionphysicianservices.com website, which includes video and marketing materials for the new brand.","Our new brand effectively replaces the Sheridan and EmCare brands used historically. In addition, Bob Coward and the physician services leadership have targeted work streams to address the hospitalist service line, our labor management process improvement, and physician engagement strategies. So with more than 15 new contracts signed, our new contract sales were on target for the quarter and 83% of those contracts were with existing health system customers.","We've also migrated our ED Services to in-network status with three statewide payers in the State of Florida. We are essentially in-network for all services for those payers. And our recent success reinforces our confidence in our plan to migrate the majority of our out-of-network to in-network status over the next 18 months to 24 months with complete revenue neutrality.","Also, on the Evolution front, we terminated our most significant contract for population health management services and are currently in the process of repositioning the population health management service line. We expect to complete the majority of that process by the end of Q2.","Now turning to the ASC segment. Our revenue increased 2.8% versus prior year. Same-center growth was 1.4% and volume was essentially flat. Volume was below expectations for all of the sub-segments of the ASC division. Lower volumes are primarily attributable, however to the multi-specialty centers and please note that we also had strong Q1 2016 comps.","Our Q1 utilization is consistent with trends we see in our other peer ASC companies and suggests a cyclical trend in that space. We have experienced two sequential quarters of soft volume and are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year to 0% to 1% same-center revenue outlook based on those recent trends, down from our previous outlook of 2% to 3%.","On the Medical Transportation front, revenue was $594 million, adjusted EBITDA was $63 million. Volume was down slightly. Fuel cost and malpractice insurance contributed to the weaker performance for the quarter. And again, we're now reporting the Medical Transportation segment in discontinued operations.","So, with that highlight, I'm going to turn it over to Claire who'll provide more color on the reconciliation of Q1 and revised guidance for 2017.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, having completed our first full quarter as a merged company, we're pleased with our in-line results. Let me first acknowledge the complexity in this quarter's financial statements due to the accounting classification of AMR as discontinued operations. So, as I walk through our financial results and our revised outlook for 2017, I'll attempt to provide clarity around the segment reporting that has been impacted by discontinued operations accounting.","Net revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.88 billion. Total net revenue for Envision was $2.47 billion when including revenue of $593.5 million from AMR. Adjusted EBITDA of $282.6 million is within the guided range that we provided in late February, and consists of $210.3 million from continuing operations and $72.3 million from discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.77, which is in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. This includes $0.66 from continuing operations and $0.11 from discontinued operations.","By moving AMR to discontinued operations, we were required under GAAP to record a deferred tax liability of $484 million. As a result, we recorded a net loss of $447.5 million or $3.84 per share. Before shifting to the segment discussion, there is one other impact to our continuing operations related to the movement of AMR to discontinued operations. GAAP requires that any corporate shared expenses that are not currently 100% allocated to the discontinued operations be allocated to continuing ops. I'll refer to this as a reallocation of corporate expenses throughout this presentation.","As a result, we reallocated $8.9 million in expenses for the quarter or a projected $35 million for the year from discontinued to continuing operations impacting adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we've reallocated $1.9 million of depreciation expense for the quarter or a projected $7.6 million for the year from discontinued to continuing ops.","We anticipate that a significant portion of the cost of these shared services will be transferred in the event of a sale of AMR. However, GAAP does not allow us to allocate those costs to AMR at this time. When excluding the reallocation of expenses, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is increased to $219.2 million and adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations is reduced to $63.4 million.","In my discussion of segment results, I will be excluding the reallocation of these expenses.","In the Physician Services segment, in an effort to make comparisons easier, I will be discussing results for Physician Services as if the merger of legacy AMSURG and Envision had occurred at the beginning of 2016 by combining historically-reported results.","Net revenue was $1.56 billion for the quarter and an increase of 9.2% from $1.43 billion for the comparable 2016 period. Revenue growth was impacted by the consolidation of a Physician Services hospital joint venture completed in the third quarter of 2016. Revenue growth consisted of growth from acquisitions of 9.7%, and same-contract revenue growth of 3.3% offset by a 3.8% decline in revenue from net contract terminations.","Day-adjusted same-contract revenue growth was 5% and consisted of 2.7% growth related to rate and 2.3% related to volume. Excluding the impact of the $6.9 million reallocation of corporate expenses, adjusted EBITDA for Physician Services was $157 million versus $154.5 million in the prior year, an increase of 1.6%. Adjusted EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by higher malpractice expense, higher revenue cycle expense and corporate allocations to this segment related to the merger. All of these higher expenses were in our forecast.","And the corporate allocation that I referred to here, differs from the reallocation of corporate expenses associated with discontinued ops. These allocations relate to the spread of enterprise expenses across the merged company segment.","Adjusted EBITDA was 10% and as previously discussed first quarter Physician Services margins are impacted by seasonally higher payroll tax expense. We expect margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year. We have seen sequential improvement in DSOs and our revenue cycle function in Florida with DSOs declining by two days since the end of last year.","For our Ambulatory Services segment, revenue was $315.9 million, up 2.8% from the prior year. Revenue growth was impacted by $1.9 million related to synergy consolidations in the quarter. Same-center growth was 1.4%, which consisted of rate growth of 1.6% offset by a 2% decline in same-center volume primarily in our multi-specialty centers. Excluding the impact of the $2 million reallocation of corporate expenses attributable to the ASC segment, adjusted EBITDA was $62.2 million and this compares to $53.6 million in the prior year.","Adjusted EBITDA growth was favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation in the 2017 period as well as lower corporate expense allocations related to the merger. For discontinued ops revenue from AMR was $593.5 million. Same-market revenue growth for AMR was 1.3%, which consisted of volume growth of 0.2% and rate growth of 1.1%. Excluding the impact of the $8.9 million expense reallocation, adjusted EBITDA was $63.4 million and was impacted by lower than anticipated volume growth.","As a reminder, we had anticipated same-market growth of 2% to 3% for AMR for all of 2017. At March 31, we had $225.3 million in cash, total debt was $5.832 billion at March 31, and net debt was $5.607 billion. Our net leverage ratio of 4.3 times, was unchanged from December 31.","Cash flow from operations excluding non-controlling interest and transaction costs was $64 million and acquisition and development capital expenditures were $73.1 million. Maintenance CapEx was $40.7 million.","And finally before opening the call for questions, I'll make some comments about our guidance update for 2017. The presentation of our guidance is impacted by the same factors that I've been discussing in the last few minutes, specifically discontinued ops as well as the relocation of shared services expenses.","Revenue is now expected to be $7.8 billion to $8.05 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $1.038 billion to $1.066 billion and this includes the reallocation of corporate expenses. In the press release, we have reconciled revised adjusted EBITDA guidance to our original guidance of $1.365 billion to $1.415 billion. These adjustments are primarily related to the discontinued operations classification.","I think it's important to note that if you take the midpoint of our revised guidance, which is $1.052 billion and add back the projected adjusted EBITDA of discontinued ops of $209 million and the $35 million of reallocated corporate expenses, the result is $1.377 billion, which is within $1 million of our current consensus.","Our revised EBITDA guidance range now reflects the $28 million spread versus the $50 million spread in our initial guidance. We are now affirming (17:36) same-center growth for ambulatory services of 0% to 1% and reaffirming same contract growth for Physician Services of 3% to 4%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be $3.38 to $3.50 for 2017. And finally, for the second quarter we expect adjusted EBITDA of $247 million to $258 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.78 to $0.84.","And at this time, I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we do have our first question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Chris, maybe one for you, you mentioned ASCs are in a cyclical downtick and I'm curious with more consumerism and more high deductible plans and payers trying to push for that, why you think your volumes in ASCs might be on a cyclical downtick?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. I think, it is more related to the higher ticket procedures, major joint repair, those types of things. We are not seeing it in the lower cost procedures, the cataracts and the GIs, seems to be more around the musculoskeletal area. We saw that back in the recession. There have been some recent reports around some lagging economic trends, it's not uncommon to see this sort of pent-up demand start to be created in these economic cycles, and I think that's what we're seeing here.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then a broader question just about the integration on the Physician Services side. Can you talk a little bit more about progress you've made there and maybe this is for Bob, what you're seeing from client response if the potential cross sales are percolating as you thought. And then also maybe just anymore color on the move to in-network, it's great to hear that the initial Florida base contracts have been revenue neutral, but curious how much more work is still to go and how confident you're in that thesis? Thanks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I'll take those one at a time, Bob will chime in. As I said in my comments, I think, the experience we've had out of the gate is reinforcing that we made the right decision strategically on a shift to in-network. And again that's born out of a convergence of positive elements of a perfect storm, where the payers want it, the customers want it, we want it, getting some clarity around some of the legislative efforts around balance billing, which is helpful to both sides in this discussion.","We had existing contracts to move in as well, so it really has not been met with any resistance, it seems like it's almost like a pent-up need because of our size and the combination of these two companies coming together, we're just in a really good position to execute on this, and it's really been one of the great positive surprises of the merger.","On the sales side, as I've mentioned before, we're out of the gate with nearly 50 new contracts, most of those \u2013 83% of those are with systems with whom we currently have a relationship today, really haven't seen any evidence of channel conflict to this point.","I do want to recognize Bob and his team for all of the internal focus and work on the integration efforts inside of Physician Services. I think, you all recall the key element of that was migrating the Envision Anesthesia into legacy Sheridan, and legacy Sheridan ED Services into legacy EmCare. A lot of work has been done there and Bob has added to that but at the same time he's kept his message and his focus on I think the right shortlist of things to focus on and we're already seeing I think great benefits from that and the team has really responded, but I want to let Bob to take it from here.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think, the new contract activity that you see is really a reflection of the promise of bringing the companies together and we've been having great reception particularly with our not-for-profit health systems and clients that really recognize the increasing ability to provide the services that we're not, neither legacy company's core competency, and so we've seen a lot of success. And I think it's also a testament to our business development team that really got out in front of this very early and our messaging and understanding each other's core strength in being able to position that successfully with the clients. So, I think that we started that from day one and that has got approved in the first quarter and I think as Chris said the integration I think is going very well. I think, it's been tremendously received by our clinicians throughout both the legacy companies, and I think, everyone is marching to the same tune and working under one brand as we go forward.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's super helpful. I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Just a couple of questions here. Claire, the $35 million of corporate reallocation costs. Have you identified how much of that do you think is expendable with an eventual sale of AMR?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We're going through that process now, but I think, we really do believe that the lion share of it will go with AMR. We just have to get the right body to the right place to make that happen. But we believe that most of that will go, and yes, we have some time to prepare for that so that we can try to also eliminate any leftover corporate overhead expenses that might be trapped once the sale serves (24:14).","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. So somewhat of a transient expense item for...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Right","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Exactly.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And can you spend a minute just talking about some of the conforming adjustments you made with the merger at the end of the year and some of the malpractice and the revenue recognition and was there any impact on the bad debt number this quarter? Just any commentary would be helpful.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Sure. There was really no impact from any of the revenue adjustments that we made in the opening balance sheet, but we did experience higher malpractice expense because we changed our methodology. It was not a huge number, but it did impact Physician Services for the quarter. But it was, as I said, it was in our budget, it was in our plans, it's just that was not a surprise.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And maybe just last one for me. Maybe, Chris, if you just, or Bob, I want to talk a little bit about Imaging Advantage, maybe a little bit misunderstood in terms of the capabilities that they bring to you, but can you talk a little bit about like how it's aligning with some of your partners, what you're doing in Phoenix? You've dropped a lot of capital into that market that might just be helpful. Thanks.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. I think Imaging Advantage was a unique asset having built pretty diversified presence throughout the country with some pretty important hospital and health system relationships, certainly leveraging its technology to provide the most efficient service that they can. But I think as core it is onsite provider of radiology services, leveraging teleradiology to do that as efficiently and as effectively as possible. And so we think there is great opportunity to leverage the relationships that they've developed and build upon that, as we continue to drive not just M&A growth through the radiology service line but also organic growth and new contract growth through the radiology service line. So, obviously, in the very early stages of that integration, but I think, like I said, it just provides a very broad distribution of client relationships for us to continue to develop and expand.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. That's helpful.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Whit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Rachana on for Josh. My question is, as it relates to M&A in the quarter and for the year, what's driving the delay including acquisitions and what have you factored in now in terms of timing of these acquisitions?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think, as we mentioned in the call on the seller side, it's really unique to each of the transaction. There is not one particular trend or anything to call out there. It's not uncommon to \u2013 as you go through diligence or if you go \u2013 or through sellers or thinking through their process, it's worth to take a little longer. At least in this case, we ended up with a bolus of LOIs. It all had one issue or another that we need to vet out over the next couple of weeks or next month. But there is really nothing systemic about that.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And it's not an exact size on predicting the timing of these closings and you have to remember that as far as the quantity of transaction that we close, they just are all small businesses without necessarily the infrastructure to move and move these processes along that some of us are accustomed to with larger companies and larger acquisitions.","Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of things for me. The tax charge that you've taken for transport that seems oddly specific. Does that tie back to some transaction value that you have in mind and could you remind us what the tax basis is in that asset?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It ties back to the book value that we recorded at the time of the merger and which was about $2.5 billion. So the sales price could be higher or lower, or it could be different from that, and then we'll have to make an adjustment, but that it ties back to the book value that we recorded at the merger.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And notwithstanding all the accounting noise on overhead costs, can you tell us what EBITDA you're marketing when you look to move that asset? I mean, do you have an idea that you can help us with that?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. This is Randy. Yeah, it will be around $290 million is what we're using, what we're thinking on that asset.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And that's what, 2017?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. Pro forma 2017, yeah.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I got you. And then just lastly, on your ASC business, I mean, we've really retraced a lot of the growth that we saw. Is it possible that the exchanges were a bigger deal in terms of top line in that division or is there something else going on, or do you think it's just a \u2013 like you said kind of a cyclical two-quarter blip?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We've tested the exchanges and that really has not proven out to be the impact. And, John, it was across all geographies and markets, so it's not isolated, which you would find more of that if it were exchanges because those tend to be state and regionally driven.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Chris, just on the ambulance sale, I think one of the discussions we've had before was the decision to sell the ambulance business also kind of ties with the decision or the strategy to redeploy the capital. So, from the board level, I mean, how are you guys thinking about redeploying what could be a pretty large sum towards the end of this year?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We're actually, as a board, we're going through a process right now. We met last week. We have some different alternatives and the board has asked me to go through and rank those and test those for shareholder creation, timing, debt, leverage, metrics and all that. So we're going to circle back over the next month and make sure we have agreement amongst ourselves at the board level on the optimal deployment of that capital, but I would tell you right now that is a work in process.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Sure. And then you've mentioned increased competition for large platform deals. What exactly are you seeing in terms of valuation, is that ticking back up again? And then, are there specific types of specialties or geographies that you could call out that where that's happening right now?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. Ironically, we're seeing a little creep in service centers, maybe a half a turn to a turn. ED is pretty steady, anesthesia is pretty steady, the radiology is moving up right now, a lot of competition in that space. There's not a lot of market for neo, that's a very small group. So, those are the areas \u2013 I think that covers most of the big segments.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then last, I'm sorry, yeah. And then last question for me, Claire. As we think about bridging from Q1 to Q2 on EBITDA, how should we be thinking about the assumptions that you've baked in and then if you can give just some color into what you assume in terms of the earlier read from the quarter into the volume expectations for the second quarter?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","I think we continue to believe that Physician Services will grow in the 3% to 4%. We've lowered a little bit of the growth rate of ASC based on the trends we've seen all the way through April. And so, I think we feel very confident that we've not seen anything that would make us think any differently about this trend.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. A few questions. First, can you maybe give us a little more detail on the AMR divestiture? Where are we in that process? Have you sent out books, have you had indications of interest, are we just beginning that?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We have launched the process formally and we'll have proposals in May for the first round. So I think for all intents and purposes, we have a formal process underway.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I just wanted to make sure I wrote this down correctly, but on ASC, its total same-center revenues at 2% to 3% that went to 0% to 1% that's not volume, that's the total same-store revenue you're expecting?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's correct.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And maybe a question for Bob, on the 50 new contracts and the 83% of net sales with existing customers, is there a particular specialty on that you would highlight?","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, they have been concentrated in anesthesiology and emergency medicine hospitalist, though there have been a few radiology sales as we try to ramp up our efforts, but I think they reflect the business mix of a company and what we have historically sold in each of the legacy companies.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then one more for me. On the terminated Evolution contracts, I know you took a loss on that. Is that loss kind of fully analyzing hat tail liability might be on that, your best guess at this point, is that what's incorporated?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It incorporates everything.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","It incorporates everything.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just want to go back to the guidance. So, I guess, Claire, if I understand this correctly, basically what you're saying is that, as you make the adjustments for discontinued operations, basically you're looking at a guidance reduction of about $24 million on a core basis. Is that the right way to think about it?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","From the top end, but we've narrowed the range. We did have a range of $50 million, but now we have the range of $28 million as we're further into this, we've already got one quarter behind us and if we take a picture for the rest of the year. So, the top end has been lower, but we've narrowed the range.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then if you about that delta then, I think you mentioned three buckets: ASCs, your timing, and then the children services. Can you give some kind of ballpark size of those three issues, like which one was more important to the guidance change?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","The ASC volume would have been the biggest, they've been low double-digits, $10 million or $11 million, and then about the same amount from acquisition timing and the children services is about $7 million each.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And so then, I guess, when we think about it, I mean, coming into this deal when you guys bought Envision, the Envision core performance have been kind of weak heading into it and then Q4 was also weak. I mean, at this point, do you feel like core Envision has stabilized at these levels or how do you think about the visibility and trajectory of that part of the business?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I really think what we've been reconciling for the last two quarters is volume, which is not \u2013 I don't really feel like there's anything systemic or internal that is framing our guidance going forward. This is really about putting it in the context the volume trend that we're seeing over the last two quarters and...","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah. And I...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","...putting it in and then overlaying as we learn more and more about our combined company and the strengths of where we're headed and the impact of our strategy, making sure that we put some more \u2013 create more consistency and confidence around the outlook and that's what we're trying to do.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Right. And I think we were pleased with the volumes and contract revenue in Physician Services for the quarter. It was a little bit above our annual guidance. So I think we feel good about the projections that we've done \u2013 made for the rest of the year in that segment.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And, I guess, last question. I didn't really hear much about this, but some of the other providers have talked about payer mix in the quarter. Was that an issue at all, I guess, particularly on the staffing side of the business in the quarter?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It was not. We actually checked that because we obviously saw that with some of the other folks reporting and we did not see anything significant in the payer mix change.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","A little bit in the children's, but that's so small it's immaterial...","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah. But in the two major lines of business, ED and anesthesia, we did not see it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani with Goldman Sachs.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Tejus. Just want to make sure I heard that right. On the 0.2% decline on the ASC volume, is that adjusted for leap day?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","That is a same day, yeah, that's a same day lever.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And a different question here. On your anesthesia business, can you remind us of your revenue mix between hospital and ASC clients and then also to the extent you can share that like on an EBITDA basis? Just trying to understand the different kind of profitability between different types of clients and your exposure there?","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","The anesthesiology business is probably about two-thirds hospital-based, one-third ambulatory facility-based. And I don't know that we drilled down deeply on those margins between those two profiles, ambulatory and anesthesia can have a slightly higher margin. But often those are closely intertwined with our hospital-based programs where there is a lot of cross-over of coverage and staffing in the geography. So we tend to look at it more on a market basis.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just kind of a follow-up there. It's kind of a more high-level question. Like, as we think about the industry sector shift, in-patient procedures moving to an outpatient setting, that's clearly a positive on the ASC business. But on the anesthesia side, I guess, how should we think about that long term in light of that same question?","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, I think that the company's presence in Ambulatory Surgery facility has certainly expanded. And also as part of the AMSURG-Sheridan merger almost three years ago, that was one of the intents around that combination. But there is also each one of our hospital clients have very robust outpatient either networks or outpatient surgery happening within their institution. So while you do see some case volume moving out of a hospital, typically we're staffing Ambulatory Surgery facility in and around those key hospital clients. So we're just picking it up on an outpatient versus in-patient basis and then you continue to see the ongoing growth in acuity of the cases that you do continue to see in the hospital. And it's a very slow, gradual process.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just want to go to the EBITDA guidance, the $1.052 billion at the midpoint or, I guess, $1.087 billion if we add back the $35 million. Can you give us what the comparable EBITDA number from a year ago was?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","So, on a pro forma basis, if you're trying to compare apples-to-apples for the whole \u2013 for the full year would be $937 million (sic) [$973 million].","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","$937 million. So we're comparing again $1.052 billion or $1.087 billion to the $937 million?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Correct.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then can you help a little bit on the seasonality of the business? The guidance implies a ramp first half to second half and I know you've talked about 1Q typically lower seasonally, but even 2Q is sort of seem like it's a little less in the quarter of the annual guide at the midpoint. So, just hoping you could talk to seasonality and sort of the ramp and your comfort as we think about second half of the year?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Well, I think the things that are probably driving the second half is less about same-contract, but more about acquisitions as they come online and as they ramp up and then the new contracts as they come online and ramp up. So, I think that's really what's driving the higher numbers in the third and fourth quarter.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just the leap day impact, is that about a percentage to revenue or is there a different consideration, another way to think about that in terms of sort of actual results versus days-adjusted basis?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","I don't think it had a meaningful impact. It was less day to the ASC division, but I don't think it was as much as a percent.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, just you specifically called out sort of volume and acuity mix in children services, just hoping if you can flesh that out for us? Thanks.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. I think that's really just specific to, again, a couple of our clients in what we said, which is that the Florida market and Arizona market, there's some market share movement. Again, our women's and children service, neonatology is our smallest service lines. So, not driving a huge impact, but it's just market share movement in couple of our larger women's and children's side.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the questions. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the single specialty, specifically GI. Was that on a same-store basis in the 2% to 3% previous guidance that you've given?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It was slightly below within the 1% to 2% range.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. And then on contract terminations, any update there? Obviously, we have the first quarter impact. How you think terminations are going to trend as we continue through the year?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","We've modeled that out based on the expected new contracts and the loan terminations. And it looks like it will be negative declining all the way through the third quarter, and hopefully turn positive by the fourth quarter.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. And my final question will be on Evolution. And, Chris, I think you mentioned a shift there, obviously, you had the contract termination and the loss that you associated with that. But can you talk a little bit how you're repositioning that?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. The focus is on the post-acute services towards a homecare\/hospice and a little bit away from the population health management component of that. Obviously with the loss of our largest contract there, we're focused more on the provider side of the service, and we're continuing to, through this reengineering process, to look at partner alternatives and other resources to continue some of that work, but we're going to do it in a different format.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","So is it formally a strategic review not necessarily with Evolution? It's a go-forward business for you guys?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Evolution for post-acute services is just a sub-component of that population health management. We'll be winding that down.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, everybody. Just a follow up on that. So the $7.1 million charge related to restructuring or redoing the contract with the largest Evolution Health customer. I know before the broader disease management, is the loss around disease management bigger than that this quarter or is the rest of the business at least breakeven?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yes. The rest of the business is positive. Yeah.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. On the volumes in the quarter, you said that anesthesia had relatively strong revenue growth. I wondered if there was any color on what you saw on anesthesia volumes versus ED volumes in the Physician Services segment.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","ED volumes continue to be a little softer than we would expect. The anesthesia volumes were stronger. We were less than 1% in ED and over 2% in volumes for anesthesia. So I think that reflects what we're kind of seeing out there.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","ED is very consistent with the peer group.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Right.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's how I've been able to see so far, A.J.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And I think you commented in prepared remarks that synergies were on track. I know you got $100 million long-term target. Was there any meaningful synergies realized in the first quarter? And as you talked about the ramps for the back half of the year, you said acquisitions and new contracts. But I would assume the back half would have more synergies than the first half and does that account for much of the swing between first half and second half?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","That would be some of it, but if you'll remember, the only synergies we're planning to get this year are cost synergies. So we did have...","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","...some cost synergies in the first quarter and it will grow at a faster pace in the third and fourth quarter. And then the revenue synergies really won't come in until 2018.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And I think you said what of the $100 million of synergies, half is the cost and half is the revenue. Is that right?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Correct.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, just going back to kind of pro forma on the ambulance business, how much CapEx do you drop when you sell that business?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It is not a large number. It's probably...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","It's in maintenance CapEx.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Let me see.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, our total CapEx on the AMR side is a little over $100 million, maintenance on that is...","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah. We're probably $40 million or $50 million...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","... probably $60 million to $70 million, yeah.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","...on ASC business.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah. That sounds good.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, I think you said what your maintenance CapEx was $200 million. So that would go to something like $150 million pro forma. Is that right?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Well, do you mean \u2013 are you talking about the discontinued of AMR...?","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, I'm just trying to think about \u2013 I'm trying to think about pro forma free cash flow, what that arrow would do when you drop that CapEx.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","So out of the $200 million-some-odd of CapEx, $110 million or $120 million is going to go...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","With AMR.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","...with AMR.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yeah.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think that's the question you had asked.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So it would be disproportionately accretive to free cash flow I guess?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yes.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Is that the way to think about it?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah. Correct.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then the other question is, at what point do you think you'll have kind of initial indications of interest in terms of multiple? And can you share with us kind of the multiple range we should be thinking about or is it too early?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","It's too early for that. It should be May.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, it's already May, you know.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Maybe it should be later than May.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I just wanted to point out I can still read a calendar.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Very good to know. I got you.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So you're thinking maybe second quarter earnings or sooner you might say, this is \u2013 when do you think you'd be able to announce? We kind of know what we're going to get for this business without obviously announcing a closing date and the specific buyer.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think we're going to get a lot done in the second quarter. I don't know if we'll get to an announcement, but I think it'll be an active quarter for that process.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Claire, can we actually get the depreciation, the interest expense, share count, and the tax rate within your guidance? I'm sorry.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","The tax rate would be 40%, the share count is 124 million shares, and I'll tell you depreciation. Give me just one second. The depreciation for the first quarter was $24 million.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","No. I guess, I'm sorry I meant for what do you have in your guidance for the full year. You're just saying that's the number...","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Well, it'll be four times of that. So it'll be $98 million in total.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And do you happen to know how much of either the debt or the interest expense you're allocating to AMR in discontinued ops?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It's about $20 million, $22 million that gets allocated a quarter.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Just wanted to check. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Here I thought everybody could get on twice today, maybe three times. Just a quick question back to Evolution population health. Can you just refresh us, originally were we contemplating breakeven or modest losses for 2017 and now that you're dropping that contract and I guess kind of shooting down the population health piece. Is there a EBITDA guidance pickup versus the original guidance...?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yes. Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If you had some losses in there?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yes. Yes. It's not a huge number; it's a small number. But, yes, we will stem the losses on that contract and so you'll see a positive EBITDA in the second half of the year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And do you recall what you had baked in for Evolution for the year originally on EBITDA?","Claire Gulmi - Envision","It's probably...","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think about $3 million.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah, a $3 million loss.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's pretty small, yeah.","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys, I figured I come back with another one, too. There is a lot of moving parts clearly...","Claire Gulmi - Envision","Yeah.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","...here and some of it was macro, some softness in some volumes metrics in some of the business lines that I think just the industry, not really necessarily specific to you. But when you think about you closed the deal in the fourth quarter. Now you've had some time to really put your arms around it. Can you give us putting aside the macro, is there any particular surprises that you've seen, either on the positive side or negative side, or opportunities that maybe are presenting themselves that are worth highlighting out for the long-term?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think, as I said in the comments, A.J., we feel very reinforced by the quarter, particularly on the same-store performance in Physician Services. I thought that was a real positive, and I don't sense that we have anything that's systemic or internal to our organization. We are reacting more to the external forces and messaging and the outlook for the future, I really think that the managed care has been a big positive. I think the overall strength of Physician Services and the customer reaction, the successes out of the gate on our contracting efforts are all positives. I really think that the investment thesis and the combination thesis is playing out early as we correctly identified that it would.","I think Bob and his team have done \u2013 and the whole team have done more in four months of integrating this company than I thought was humanly possible. I'm very energized by the physicians and their reaction to the combination, the way the board has behaved, and really with complete collaboration has been great. I think the fact that we were able to distill our strategic plan down to \u2013 and so begin to execute it in that period of time is a real testimony to the strength of the organization.","We have a very clear and committed view on where we're headed and that's really helped shape our ability to make decisions. You're going to see us executing out of the gate around Evolution, around AMR, around repositioning Physician Services, building up the post-acute, building those things up (56:53), and that's lot of good work to get done in a short period of time. So that has really invigorated me and inspired me to continue to pushing us forward here and reconfirm our commitment to the plan. I mean I think putting these two companies together was the right decision.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call to Chris Holden for closing comments.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","A.J., you've inspired me on the closing comments here. First of all, let me say, we recognize that the shift of the medical transportation into disc ops may add a certain degree of difficulty to everyone's analysis in this quarter and to formulating the outlook for the remainder of the year. And we want you to know that we all stand ready to help sort through those numbers and to assist through the analytics. Trust me, we know it's been complicated.","Also, I want to take this opportunity before we close, I want to recognize some of our recent winners of the physician honoraries of the year for radiology, surgical services, hospitalist, and emergency medicine. These gentlemen and the teams here have been a great inspiration to us and I think they deserve to be recognized. So (58:28) in Radiology, Dr. Mark Glazer (58:32) in Surgical Services; Dr. James Reed (58:35) in Emergency Medicine; and Dr. Mustafa Sardini (58:38) in Hospitalist Medicine. I had the pleasure to be with these gentlemen in our leadership conference couple of weeks ago, and I can assure you these folks demonstrate their commitment to clinical quality and leadership that inspire us to support our physicians in their pursuit to provide the highest-quality patient care.","And I also want to recognize our other physicians, clinical staff, support staff and management who have accomplished so much more than I could have imagined in the last four months as we formed this new Envision Healthcare.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect this time.","And I will turn the meeting over to Craig Wilson, General Counsel. You may begin.","Craig Wilson","Thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Envision Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call and introduce our presenters; Bill Sanger, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon along with our remarks today are made as of today, November 5, 2014 and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold. Today\u2019s remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included within our press release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.evhc.net. All comparisons including in our presentation today are for third quarter 2014 to third quarter 2013 unless otherwise noted.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","Bill Sanger","Thank you, Craig and good afternoon. Q3 was another successful quarter for Envision Healthcare. Revenue was up 20.3%, adjusted EBTIDA of 25.1% and adjusted EPS with $0.35. The majority of our growth continues to be field by new contract wins, which we believe is a result of a unique integrated service offerings across all business segments.","The 20.3% revenue growth, 8.4% was driven by net new contract wins, 6.2% from same-store and 5.7% from acquisitions. EmCare\u2019s revenue growth of 23.6% was primarily driven by 17.7% organic growth of which 11% was from new contract wins. Same-store contract growth increased from Q2 and from prior year partially driven by the benefits of healthcare reform.","New starts in the quarter are projected to drive approximately $75 million on annualized net new revenues. Year-to-date new contract wins are expected to produce approximately $275 million in annualized new revenues. Our strong contract growth continues to be the primary driver of our integrated ED and hospitalist services lines.","Our new service lines surgery is gaining traction and expanding the both scale and scope that now includes orthopedics. On a separate note, on the last earnings call, we described a new technology that we developed that EmCare called DASH. This technology is that can streamline, the direct admission process from primary care practices, urgent care centers and free standing EDs to the hospital and patient setting.","The early result of this program are showing substantially improved coordination of care between our hospital partners and primary care providers. We planned to roll this program out nationwide. Our newest initiative aimed and enhancing our relationship with community physicians is our integrated primary care service line.","This initiative adds value to our hospital relationships and help solidify referral channels for our hospital partners. Under this program large primary care and multispecialty practices partner with Envision Healthcare under a formal agreement or arrangement where in AMR, EmCare and Evolution Health collectively collaboratively work with the group to provide medical transportation, community therametics hospital based physician services and post-acute care. This innovative approach to working with primary care enhances care coordination improves market share for our hospital partner and creates a new market for Envision Healthcare services.","This approach is also very attractive for contracting for health plans. Our first relationship under this agreement is with one of the largest primary care organizations in the Southeast. This group consists of 300 primary clinicians practicing on the 50 locations and operates one of the largest and most successful ACOs in the region.","Additionally, this group includes over 30 \u2013 over 20 [indiscernible], we are partnership arrangement with this group, we intend to develop a nationally-based critical care service line. This is the first that many pipeline opportunities to partner in delivering creative solutions for future growth that is both facility based as well as those which are outside the hospital environment.","At AMR net revenue grew 14.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth was 32.5%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by new contract wins and same market increases which was partially driven by the positive aspects of healthcare reform.","We continue to benefit from 911 contract wins over the last 12 months including our improved win rates for IFT and managed transportation. We were recently awarded a contract in Oregon to manage non-emergent medical transportation services in the Great Portland area.","This will be a five year contract with annualized revenues of $30 million and expected to start in early 2015. At AMR we had a 180 basis point improvement in operating margins from effectively leveraging our higher revenue base further market rationalization and the benefits derived from our technology investments.","These investments have improved our true scheduling and deployment initiatives. We\u2019re very encouraged by these exceptional results at AMR and believe our improved win rates, market-centric strategy and our acquisition pipeline will enhance our growth that further solidify has the market leader.","On the Evolution front, we continue \u2013 we complete our agreement with Ascension Health and two hospital systems for post-acute services during the quarter. The new joint venture with Ascension Health will initially include five of their 23 communities with the first phase of their agreement beginning in Q1 2015.","As previously noted, revenues in the first year of operations are estimated to be between $75 million to $100 million. Expansion into additional communities is planned in a phase of limitation over the next three years. Recently, we entered into agreements to provide transitional care and integrated mobile health services to Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston and into personal health services.","Our initial market with UHS will be the Las Vegas, Nevada area. With this momentum, we are very encouraged by the growth prospects for Evolution Health. I would now like to make a few comments about the Ebola situation.","Those of you who follow the media are seeing that Evolution and Envision Healthcare has been at the forefront of responding through the Ebola situation. We are critical leadership at both EmCare and AMR supported by a medical command center at Evolution Health; we are providing extensive council, consultation and resource escalation nationwide.","We have and we\u2019ll continue to work extensively throughout hospital systems in our private and public sector colleagues at the local state of federal level. In closing, we continue to be very bullish about the outlook for the rest of the year and into 2015. Supplement our organic growth; there are significant opportunities for target acquisitions across all segments.","Moreover, we are confident that we will continue to meet the demands of hospitals, communities and health plans through our unique value propositions driven by our integrated services, our focus on metric improvements and our ability to provide improved outcomes at lower cost.","Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our more than 13,000 team members and affiliated clinicians for their tireless efforts in serving needs of our patients. Randy?","Randy Owen","Well thank you, Bill. As highlighted in the earnings release, we just posted. Our net revenue for the third quarter was $1.15 billion, a 20.3% increase over prior year. This is driven by a 23.6% increase at EmCare and a 14.7% increase at AMR. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $152.2 million, an increase of 25.1%.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.2% an increase of 50 basis points.","Net income for the quarter was $52.8 million compared to a net loss of $7.7 million in 2013. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to an increase in income from operations and the net impact of debt retirements in both 2014 and 2013. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.35 and GAAP diluted EPS was $0.28.","EmCare net revenue was $748.1 million in the quarter and increased 23.6%, the largest component were 11% of EmCare\u2019s revenue increase was from net new contracts, 6.7% came from same-store increases and 5.9% from acquisitions.","On a same-store basis, year-over-year revenue increased 7.9% from an increase in weighted patient encounters of 6.3% and a net rate increase of 1.6%. For ED and hospitalist, same-store volume increases in Medicaid expansion states were 6.7%, while volume increases in non-Medicaid expansion states were 6.1%.","During 2014 total EmCare self-pay volume mix is decreased by approximately 310 basis points to 15.7% at the end of Q3. While we continue to see decreases in self-pay and Medicaid expansion states, overall self-pay did not change as much from Q2, as we have historically seen a higher seasonal level of self-pay in Q3. For example self-pay is historically in Q3 is about a 100 basis points higher than in other quarters.","Within Medicaid expansion states, self-pay mix was 580 basis points lower in the third quarter of 2014 compared to year end 2013. A further 180 basis point reduction from the 400 basis point reduction we saw in self-pay in the first half of the year. We also saw corresponding increase in Medicaid and Medicaid HMO mix.","We believe higher volumes in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states to now both increased utilization of previously uninsured patients and general improvement in economic conditions. As we noted previously, only 23% of our current volume is in Medicaid expansion states and modestly niche component of our revenue growth.","As you may recall, almost 50% of the EmCare volume is in Texas and Florida, which at this time have not expanded their Medicaid programs. Our health reform impact is not as significant as it may be in the future, these states provides some expansion or make a change to their Medicaid programs.","Included in the 1.6% same-store rate growth, our ED and hospitalist net revenue per visit increased 4% in the quarter, due to the impact of changes in payer mix parity and rate increases. This is primarily offset by lower revenue per encounter in our anesthesia service line from the change in one of our anesthesia MSA contracts in 2013 and rate changes in our Evolution Health business.","Total revenue related to healthcare reform in the quarter was $12.6 million including payer mix changes of $3.1 million and parity benefits of $9.5 million compared to parity benefit of $2.3 million in Q3 2013.","Year-to-date healthcare reform revenue including payer mix changes and parity has been approximately $31 million. EmCare adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% to $99.7 million with an EBITDA margin of 13.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margins include the impact of changes in our Evolution Health business, including additional investments and infrastructure as we prepare for expansion of services for Ascension Health on a number of other contract opportunities.","Excluding the impact of Evolution Health, EmCare adjusted EBITDA increased by 27.7% and margins improved by 30 basis points to 13.7%. This EmCare adjusted EBITDA does include approximately $1 million of acquisition cost in the quarter.","We\u2019re continuing to see improvements in operating costs and insurance trends. Our solid cost of percent of net revenue improved 20 basis points over last year, 18 basis points sequential. On a same contract basis, the increase in volume and rate have led to an improvement in margins of 180 basis points in those contracts year-over-year.","We\u2019re also seeing favorable trends in our insurance program this year due to our continued focus on risk management processes that are contracts. AMR net revenue was $402.2 million, an increase of 14.7%. Of that increase, revenue increased 4% from net new contract wins, 5.6% from same market increases and 5.1% from acquisitions.","On an existing market basis, our weighted volume increased by 4.9% and revenue per transport increased by 0.7%. Same market volume increases in Medicaid expansion states for 5.3% and 4% in non-expansion states. The increase in revenue per trip was driven primarily by an improvement in payer mix as a result of lower self-pay and higher Medicaid mix in those expansion states.","Total AMR self-pay volume mix has dropped 300 basis points year-to-date from approximately 19% at year-end to about 16% in third quarter of 2014, an additional 50 basis point reduction in self-pay from the second quarter. The reduction in self-pay and Medicaid expansion states was approximately 400 basis points with a corresponding increase in Medicaid and Medicaid HMO mix. The net impact of payer mix changes in existing markets contributed approximately $4.2 million in additional revenue in the quarter and $10.2 million year-to-date.","AMR adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 32.5% to $52.5 million. This increase is attributable to a combination of revenue growth and improved operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 180 basis points to 13.1%. Comp and benefits as a percent of net revenue was lower by 40 basis points primarily related to technology initiatives around our deployment cost.","Insurance expense included 50 basis points as a percent of net revenue. Due to $1.2 million in favorable prior year insurance developments in the quarter compared to unfavorable adjustments of $1.7 million in Q3 of 2013. Cash flow provided by operating activities improved significantly due to improved earnings, reduction in EmCare DSO and lower interest payments. Operating cash flow was $100.1 million in the quarter compared to a $31.7 million last year for a net improvement of $68.4 million.","Accounts receivable increased $34.3 million in the quarter compared to $71.5 million last year. The net cash impact of the growth was improved due to a two-day decrease in EmCare DSO in the quarter. Our EmCare DSO is still higher than historical trends due to continued strong new contract growth enhancing a five-day reduction in EmCare DSO in 2014 and expect further decreases.","Net cash used in investment activities was $40 million compared to $42.3 million last year. Net cash provided by financing activities was $24.5 million compared to $549.3 million. The change was primarily due to the net impact from our initial public offering in Q3 of last year and the redemption of the 2017 pick notes.","Adjusted free cash flow improved by $47.4 million to $82.8 million in the quarter compared to $35.4 million last year. Our total net leverage is down to 3.5x due to the growth in the business and improved cash flows. Our free cash flow generation and continued deleveraging capability allows us plenty of flexibility to pursue targeted acquisitions in the future.","On a final note, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance of adjusted EPS to be a $1.15 to $1.20 and 2014 adjusted EBITDA to be $553 million to $568 million. We anticipate providing guidance for 2015 on our fourth quarter earnings call after the close of the year. Bill?","Bill Sanger","Thank you, Randy. Operator, we\u2019d now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Mr. Josh Raskin from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Alex Pachman \u2013 Barclays","Hi, thanks. This is actually Alex Pachman in for Josh. Obviously, a lot of new business recorded in the quarter on the Evolution segment. I\u2019m just trying to understand the potential impact from the deals. Can you help us size either in terms of revenue or number of hospitals what we should anticipate from the UHS Memorial Hermann contracts?","Bill Sanger","We are starting with probably three of their hospitals and it\u2019s primarily related to the transitional care program, it will not be a pilot, but it will be a program that starts at the beginning of Q1. And as we progress in terms of achieving outcomes, we\u2019ll expand through the other segments of their hospital system.","Alex Pachman \u2013 Barclays","Got you. So I mean given that these \u2013 this little deals is really the first significant deals for the segment. Can you help us think about what we should expect from Evolution in terms of the earnings contribution call it in three to five years\u2019 time?","Bill Sanger","We\u2019re not going to give forward statements relative to our numbers three to five years from now, Alex. I will tell you that if you look at Evolution Health and we\u2019ve been very bullish about this company because we believe it\u2019s positioned very effectively and where healthcare is moving. The three distinct segments in customer segments, one is hospitals and if we work with them in their transitional care program, managing the readmission process and that\u2019s going to be very effective \u2013 efficient program for us.","Secondly, it\u2019s with health plans. Although, we have not yet announced any major health relationships those are pending and we\u2019re very confident about our billing on a go-forward basis to discuss those in the future. Lastly, a market that is emerging for us and I somewhat alluded to it today with our new primary care service line is IPAs and large group practices who are either taking risk or some form of final payment on the post-acute care side and it\u2019s just accounting managing the highest duty patients. Those are three distinct targets that present for us major opportunities for growth. We do anticipate significant double-digit growth for Evolution Health over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Good evening. Just a couple of questions. I guess Bill, following up on your comments there on the large group practices, are you really focused only on the post-acute and I guess how bigger than opportunity should we think this will be and I guess how close are you in achieving next deal in that space?","Bill Sanger","Well, thanks for the question Kevin. Let me just digress for a moment and talk a little bit about the integrated primary care service line. It\u2019s really a result of us working with primary care when we introduced the notion of DASH it was the admission process for hospitals. More and more we\u2019re finding it large group practices that have an influence on hospital-based physician selection.","And they also have needs that extent outside the hospital, which include transportation needs and also post-acute care management particularly if they\u2019re taking any form of bundle or risk payments. We have looked at this as an opportunity to create a new venue frankly to influence decision-making as it relates to outsource hospital pay services as well as create new opportunities to work with the ITAs and large group practices.","It\u2019s not our intention to buy any stretch imagination to acquire primary care practices, but you work with hospitals and identifying those groups as they want to solidify in terms of primary care mentioned through their hospitals. We see this as a new service line that has a tremendous potential. We are building a pretty significant pipeline and believe that it would be over the next several years a major source of new growth for EmCare as well as the other two divisions.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","And with your integrated service offering, are you able to participate and capture any of the new revenues coming from chronic care management from Medicare?","Bill Sanger","We are in the bundle payment program with Medicare on their pilot program and we will be working directly with CMS as well as health plans to go after the chronic care programs.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, got it. Two last questions for Randy. One, in your prepared remarks you said self-pay is higher in Q3 it\u2019s kind of been historically that way, just wondering why \u2013 what causes that? And then also what\u2019s going on with your anesthesia revenue per case I think you said it was down and then also Evolution Health rate changes that only let to the 1.6% growth in price.","Randy Owen","It\u2019s Randy, Kevin. If you look at again just traditionally and some of that maybe where you\u2019re getting in to toward the end of summer and then the school starts we just tended to see a little bit more activity in self-pay. I don\u2019t want to overplay it. It just tends to be a little seasonal; self-pay is never the same percentage all year long. So we just traditionally have seen a little bit more of that in Q3 and it typically even outside of reform tends to decrease a little bit in the fourth quarter.","On the rate side, Kevin, we talked about this in the second quarter, we had a MSA contract with the \u2013 for a large anesthesia group that we did a number of years ago that group was acquired and so that contract was restructured and since there was no real volume, so that we\u2019re providing self-services some of that revenue stream was renegotiated and so that\u2019s been part of the driver for, the main driver for this change in anesthesia.","On the Evolution Health, side of the business system in terms of the core business, we\u2019ve had some decrease in that business and some of that is not, some of that\u2019s volume driven and some of that is just weight driven again. A pretty small, 60 basis points, on that front, so not a big impact, but the point there was, couple of offsets but the overall rate environment especially if you look at ED and hospitalist, which are more affected by health reform is still pretty positive.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question over the phone comes from Mr. Brian Zimmerman, Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open.","Brian Zimmerman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi thanks and good afternoon guys. Question around admission trends and I appreciate the comments on self-pay admissions, but have you been able to dive in a bit more in parse out just what sort of an increase in Medicaid admissions you\u2019re saying, what exchange volumes are coming in to the emergency rooms. Just any additional flavor for what you\u2019re saying early on with health reform would be helpful?","Bill Sanger","Well Brian, we\u2019re seeing, I think we are seeing a little bit more on the Medicare, kind of visit side if you will on the traditional sort of ED side of the business. No major changes if you look at mix, but it\u2019s still been, maybe its 20 basis points it\u2019s not a big number this quarter in terms of an increase in Medicare. On the exchange side, again sort of the ones where we track, we can\u2019t track all of the potential exchange, patients. But we are seeing some increases there well that\u2019s going from maybe, less than a percent of our mix to probably closer to 1.5% to ultimately maybe 2% of the mix. So, I think it\u2019s still early on the exchange side.","Brian Zimmerman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then I think you called that in your prepared remarks, the volumes are up 6.1% even in the one expanding Medicaid, did you see any geographical variation or where there any trends you could call out in that regard as well?","Bill Sanger","Not specific, well I wouldn\u2019t say there was any one state, there is little variances by states, but general like others in the industry have we\u2019ve seen, this year pretty solid volumes. And so clearly some of its driven by the newly insured, but I think again there tends to be more volume as well. Our acuity is a little lower, I would say as we probably would expect from especially, a little bit more Medicaid utilization and why not. But no sort of concentration of volume change that, that would be worth calling out.","Brian Zimmerman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then on the AMR side of the business, I appreciate your comments around the contract in Oregon, but are there any other RFPs in process that you would like to call out or put on a radar screen?","Bill Sanger","Well if we continue to look positively at California, particularly San Diego. The political issues facing the San Diego RFP as to do with the state getting involved in the city, in the county. We fully do expect that to do come out, that\u2019s come out would be one of larger frankly that I want in the country. We have been very active in the State of Arizona in terms of application for CON and we feel confident that we will be going after 911 in the State of Arizona when we get out the CON. But there are no additional larger ones at this point in time that will be coming out until mid-2015.","Brian Zimmerman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Andrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good afternoon. Going back to reform benefit, clearly a continued improvement in declines in the uninsured, but still generally lag there, where we got out of the poor profit hospitals, this quarter. I was wondering if you can maybe just talk about your thoughts about that process, some of that related to the process again these treatments showed you know expectation overtime, hopefully you\u2019ll continue to get more and more people insured; you\u2019re getting an expansion state. So, do you think the reductions you\u2019re seeing in 2014 for this state expanding is probably the run rate going forward?","Bill Sanger","Andrew, I do think, I mean we\u2019re continuing to see it moving, little bit every month. To your point, there is some delay in, what maybe the ultimate payer. So we do see where someone may come in initially and may come in as a self-pay and their classified it is, as the self-pay. And then within sort of, 30 or 60 day period of time, you may identify either on our own or working with the hospital that, they are eligible for Medicaid, patients.","So, we do see at any one point in time, where based on the mix, we see where over the next few months, you could still see another probably 100, 150 basis point movement in that number, if you think about what the ultimate sort of payer is. So, we\u2019re continuing to see that, to see where it, to say where it ends up Andrew, I don\u2019t know. But we are seeing continuing to see movement.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And maybe just, little surprised do you have this habit, I mean have you ever looked at, what\u2019s the declines and uninsured that\u2019s ultimately and minutes of hospital versus those that you guys treating them, sent home, I mean is there a higher conversion rate for there is ultimately get it, as I presume, so?","Bill Sanger","We have not looked at that, really at this point Andrew.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just, lastly here on the $7.3 million you kind of highlight as the, reform benefit related to mix, talking, I\u2019m following up on the previous question there on the exchange percent, is that mostly Medicaid in your mind or, are you factoring in some exchange contribution in that calculation?","Bill Sanger","It\u2019s mostly Medicaid Andrew, so it\u2019s right now the exchange data is, again, it\u2019s probably not complete, because we don\u2019t know 100% everybody that\u2019s part of exchange the ones that we do know are still a pretty very small percentage of the mix. So, it\u2019s predominantly Medicaid rate versus sort of the self-pay rate.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, as either you get more information or as exchange is continuing to ramp that could also be a further contribution to what you\u2019re defining as a reform benefit?","Bill Sanger","And remember the other thing that we mentioned was, again throughout we have a higher percentage on the AMR side of volume in Medicaid expansion states. Because, of the concentration we have in Texas and Florida, it\u2019s still smaller percentage, for us and I think for others, in the space. So, I think, when that turns or whatever happens there at some point is more of an upside for EmCare.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies. Sir your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Hey good afternoon guys.","Bill Sanger","Hey Brian.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Bill, just the first question for you, you talked about the new service line which is surgery. So, if you remind just giving us some color on how, you guys are looking at that opportunity in terms of sizing it and what\u2019s your strategy is in terms of expanding into that new service offering?","Bill Sanger","Sure, there are two components Brian to our surgery line. One is the integrated program that anesthesia and surgery, the other is that expanding surgery program to start off as trauma surgery, now it\u2019s expanded to subspecialty to surgery. Right now that program has about 14 or 15 programs, but a pipeline is twice that size. This is an area that\u2019s really needed by hospitals that allows them to have a more effective ED, by having trauma surgery coverage.","And then with the subspecialties to that also increases their ability to take more patients. So, we\u2019re very bullish about this, we believe that, we probably tripled the size of this over the next year and also it services us good run rate for us going forward as well as some of the new service lines were looking at.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then Bill, in California we saw the news about the tenant hospitals for example where the doctors are protesting the decision from tenant to avoid the ED and the hospitalist business to a national provider. Is that something that we should kind of watch out for going forward, we are hospitals to make that decision, we\u2019ll have to deal with local physicians having to block a national provider such as yourself coming in right away?","Bill Sanger","Well there is a couple of factors that was, certainly a challenge to us in the industry and that physician took the position of that perhaps the hospital they now have the right direction to moving that area. I don\u2019t believe, we\u2019re going to see a huge change in physicians reacting negatively to be, have an outsource relationship with us and other outsource companies. One other initiatives that we have put forth is our primary care initiative, where by working more closely with primary care who greatly enforces admissions in the hospital, they will have an influence on who provide services in the hospital. I think that\u2019s an element to keep in mind, physicians are becoming more aware that they do have power over, what decisions are made in the hospital. But, I think if this is socialized well upfront, the advantageous to the hospital to the group are well articulated. We don\u2019t see a problem.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Well Bill, just a follow up on that, is that you guys in California?","Bill Sanger","I really can\u2019t comment on that, because no national or public announcement has been made yet.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have Mr. Richard Close, Avondale Partners. Sir your line is open.","Richard Close \u2013 Avondale Partners","Thank you. I was wondering if you could update us on parity, I know you gave some numbers here with the third quarter, but how you\u2019re thinking about parity for the reminder of the year and then as we entered 2015?","Bill Sanger","Well I think from a parity standpoint, I would expect Q4 to be fairly similar to what, third quarter was maybe little bit on increased just with the continued growth that we continue, that we see. So, it has been a little better benefits and probably what we initially thought earlier in the year. But, 2015 obviously it\u2019s unclear at the moment. So, right now, parity goes away, from a legal perspective. I do think there is opportunity to we\u2019re just like others working with the industry and in working on with congressional leaders et cetera to really make sure they understand that, well lot of these patients really don\u2019t have other alternatives, they are not able to get access in primary care. And so, I think we do feel confident that there is an opportunity, there is profits in place today that, seems to work.","So, I can\u2019t commit to that, but I think we are working with others to try to ensure that that is extended. Like parity [indiscernible] have some provide, we \u2013 as we did our multi-year planning, we did not anticipate this being more in 12 months gets big as well. And so, I think we obviously will work hard to try to keep parity. But if it goes away it doesn\u2019t really change our direction that going into the future.","Richard Close \u2013 Avondale Partners","I guess, what I\u2019m really trying to get at, maybe and you can\u2019t answer this, but do you think you can see acceleration in other parts of your business that can, I guess more than offset that core that\u2019s created once it goes away?","Bill Sanger","Clearly, we believe we can do that, obviously we believe in managing the environment not only the company.","Richard Close \u2013 Avondale Partners","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next we have Mr. A.J. Rice, UBS. Sir your line is open.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS","Thanks. Maybe just first with all the growth opportunities you got particularly in the EmCare side and Evolution is with half shoot of that, how much is, how \u2013 what are you seeing in terms of your major recruit, particularly I guess physicians, but other healthcare professionals perhaps as well. And how much of a gaining factor of your growth is that how available are you finding it, why don\u2019t you get these stock to ramp up this growth?","Bill Sanger","Clearly, our providers are fundamental to our success. And there is not enough physician providers or clinician frankly in the country. Our shortage is primarily on the EmCare side. We recruit over 2,000 clinicians a year, however we have improved substantially, our recruitment efforts over the last year. In addition, we have start Welcomes Company that is getting tremendous traction as it going to be great assistance for us on the start-ups.","So, well I\u2019m concerned about it and, we look at this very carefully, however I think our recruitment engine is probably doing as great of a job and it\u2019s ever done in the last couple of years of recruiting physicians and clinicians. And A.J. remember that on the EmCare side as we had contracts. Typically a large percentage of those physicians come to work for us, because if they lose their contract they don\u2019t have a job. So it\u2019s typically working with the hospital and the hospital will determine how many they would like to replace or have new. So, it\u2019s unusual to have to start with zero and have to recruit, every physician. So it does maybe take a little longer in time, but I think we\u2019ve dealt in that environment for many years and there is no dramatic change in that sort of overall provider environment.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then my follow up was, I know year ago we\u2019re thinking about how health reform lines play out, you guys say don\u2019t forget we might actually get some back on subsidies in hospitals, we might have to, we obviously have to share some of their physician partners. Has that played out as you expected, as there been any variance in that, I mean how is the discussion going with hospitals or if there is any maybe it\u2019s too early, over subsidies in light of health reform and the percentage and so forth that you gave out to your other partners. Just curious on the update on that?","Randy Owen","I can\u2019t, we\u2019re still seeing, some of those dynamics that we anticipated, I think in some case on the subsidies some of that where they haven\u2019t hit from a timing standpoint maybe earlier in the year that you might have thought, some of that maybe, because obviously overall volumes are better. So, we still do see that, I think on a longer term basis, I don\u2019t think our thought would change in terms of how that would \u2013 how that would play out, especially from a subsidy perspective.","But, also on the physician provider side, lot of those we do \u2013 we do shift. So, again I think that\u2019s pretty consistent with kind of what we thought, it\u2019s based on compensation plans and lot of plans will have some sharing with physician on that.","Bill Sanger","But there is nothing that, outside of what we had forecasted.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS","Okay, all right thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Daniels, William Blair. Sir your line is open.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Randy, I\u2019m sorry to make you go over this one again, but can you comment on the margin profiled EmCare X the Evolution start up, number one the cost there and the number two is we think about modeling that for Q4 kind of on a go forward basis, given all the momentum in that segment, should we consider that pressuring margins a little bit in the near term as you start up all with the new contracts?","Randy Owen","No, no not actually. If you look at, again we did see margin improvements on the EmCare side, again if you take out sort of the Evolution Health impact. We do see that each year and so look, while you may have some seasonal plannings with coverage around the holidays. We have traditionally had better margins towards the end of the year. You have less payroll taxes, especially with better volume, so we really do not see sort of an annual decline in our margins at all in the fourth quarter. But I think that\u2019s reflected in sort of our annual guidance when you look at where we are and where we expect to be.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Sure, and you actually have the details on what the set of pass where I think you said the growth was over 27.7% is that right, the EBITDA growth ex-loads?","Randy Owen","No, no not start-up cost. So if you just take, so let me just clarify that.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","I got to make you understand that one.","Randy Owen","If you look EmCare segment, it includes some of the EmCare, Ascension contracts and some of the Evolution Health business that we have as well, right. So, but I\u2019m doing the same if you take it out, sort of the impact of the Evolution Health business on that, our margins you know improved. On the start-up cost, so I mean that we have about $10 million in recent quarters, so we had little over $10 million this quarter of start-up cost. Then we had a similar number in Q2 and actually had a higher number in Q1, if you may recall.","So, that is part of, starting that so many contracts, you do have temporary staffing cost, contract buy offs and things like that. So, it\u2019s not an, inconsequential number, but we are starting to see some slight improvement in that and in some cases, getting some additional subsidies to help offset that where hospitals have access to start contract very quickly or to replace a larger share of physicians then you might typically see.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Okay that\u2019s helpful, understood that. So, second question here just turning again to the primary care initiatives, but you mentioned a couple of times that, one of the strategic advantages there as they have a lot of influence on the hospital based coverage. So, I\u2019m, curious in the market where we\u2019re starting an initial initiative, do you have broad coverage of EmCare in the local facilities there, is that something that could lead to expanded contracts in those hospitals over the next year or so.","Bill Sanger","I think primarily the later volume.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Okay, perfect. Great, thanks guys.","Bill Sanger","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","Steve Baxter \u2013 Bank of America","Hi this is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. So, I did want to come back to the EmCare margin discussion, I appreciate the color stripping out evolution. The year-over-year looks like margins are basically stable and that as I sort of guess is somewhat surprising given the strong same-store growth and the impact of healthcare reform. So, I would suspect the reasoning that the margins were relative flat is because, of the strong new contract growth and acquisitions? Trying to get a sense of how much of the headwinds that might be to say what the same-store EmCare margin might be?","Randy Owen","Well what we\u2019ve talked about before, and your absolutely right is, we continue to have huge number of start-up. So, I mean in the pipeline it\u2019s still, very robust. What we\u2019ve talked about before and we continue to see that is that, when we start a contract, it\u2019s not unusual to have a low to be single digit, mid-single digit or low digit, single digit margin. And it\u2019s usually it can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months to get you more of a mature margin, more of our traditional mature, margin. So, we do see that the reason you don\u2019t see that and I think we\u2019ve told people before that, for long-term you expect some margin improvement in the near-term especially given all of the starts that we wouldn\u2019t anticipate any significant changes in margins.","The one comment I made, which I think if you look longer term, is you know, in our same-store if you look at, because of the volume in the rate on contracts that we\u2019ve had, for the year pretty nice margin improvement in those contracts. So, we would expect that, on contracts going forward just today or still expect them to currently be replaced with, a large number of new contracts going forward as well.","Steve Baxter \u2013 Bank of America","Okay that makes sense. So, I guess just in terms of trying to size the things for us as we\u2019re projecting forward, can you give us the sense just kind of relative to where your kind of consolidated EmCare margin is, where the same-store margin might be? Thanks.","Randy Owen","Well I think if, I mean your same-store margins are going to be, obviously higher than that, I would say depending on where the contract is or whatever you make these stuff more and sort of the, mid-teens, because your basis are larger base. But and then, but you do have them obviously the impact to the start-up cost, the contract start-up contracts.","Steve Baxter \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Mr. Gary Taylor, Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Hi good afternoon.","Randy Owen","Hi Gary.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","I just wanted to clear our, I just missed the couple of numbers, but I know you gave, so I apologize so.","Randy Owen","Yes, okay.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Parity this quarter you said was?","Randy Owen","9.5 million Gary.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay. And I know you\u2019ve given this a couple of times, but I just, I think I got confused between segments. When you talked about AMR revenue and expansion states versus EmCare revenue and expansion states, can you give us both of those again?","Randy Owen","Well what I\u2019ve done Gary is, given you, we\u2019ve given sort of the mix change and expansion states versus the total. So, if you look at EmCare now through the end of September, we\u2019ve seen about a 580 basis point decrease in self-pay and expansion states.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay.","Randy Owen","And mostly then the offset is increasing for Medicaid and Medicaid HMO. On the AMR side it\u2019s about 400 basis points in the expansion states on the cumulative year-to-date kind of basis. The other number that we gave here and of course some of, a lot of this would come from the impact of expansion state is. On the EmCare side, a side for parity, we had about $3.1 million; it\u2019s over $3 million of additional revenue from the difference and effectively let\u2019s say its self-pay and for most part of the Medicaid rates. And a little over $4 million on the AMR side.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Yes, I heard, I just thought, I thought you had historically given, I thought you had said earlier, maybe I just misheard it, I thought you said, if you look at the total book of business for EmCare x percent of the total book is in expansion state x percent of total book?","Randy Owen","Well, I\u2019m sorry yeah Gary we have 20%, we have done it on volume basis, 23% of EmCare volume is in expansion state, that\u2019s right.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","And AMR?","Randy Owen","AMR is about 65%.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Just sounded a little different to me, I just want to make sure I had those.","Randy Owen","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","And the question is on the 2.2 million of the infrastructure and acquisition cost that you talk about, it looks like only if I\u2019m not mistaken, while you called out 366,000 of restructuring charges and kind of the remainder of that 2.2 you essentially 8 in your reported EBITDA figure. Is that figure \u2013 is that kind of 2.2 is that kind of where you\u2019ve been running and what you kind of been absorbing and is that kind of go-forward run rate makes sense, I guess it must be because you didn\u2019t really call it out of your EBITDA, but I just want to make sure I understood that.","Randy Owen","Yes. Look I think it is included in our adjusted EBITDA, we think that\u2019s obviously part of the business and cost of doing business. About 1 million of that Gary is on the EmCare side really around again sort of acquisition cost some of that\u2019s coming in from the Phoenix acquisition that happened at the end of \u2013 at the very end of Q2 and a couple of other smaller ones that will fluctuate Gary, just based on the number of acquisitions that might happen at any one point in time.","The other, I\u2019ll call it $1.2 million if you will on Evolution Health is really around, obviously we got a lot of changes in the business, it\u2019s huge growth coming in the business here. And so we have added resources to help implement the start-up for example of some of the essentials. So I do think we\u2019ll see that number for some period of time \u2013 over time that will go down clearly because this is more concentrated and if you stand up, part of that maybe business. But I think we would see that, I would expect to see something similar probably in Q4 for example just as we\u2019re getting ready to start extension.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","And last question, could you maybe ballpark where you think Evolution revenues are annualizing now, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re disclosing that on a quarterly basis anymore. But, can you give us a sense of what you think that annualized book revenues is the Evolution?","Randy Owen","Well, we\u2019re still around, I think we\u2019ve talked about before. We\u2019re still around that $100 million mark. This is pretty sort of some of this new business that we talked about pre extension. So I would think of it as base of around 100 million, obviously, we talked about extension being 75 to 100. So you could double your revenue pretty \u2013 I think that we know of now that are starting up.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Randy Owen","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Mr. Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I wanted to pick up a little bit on just the last part, Randy you did say that the Evolution Health I guess investment to stand up some other things, you\u2019re doing would be about same in Q4. I guess this, maybe taking a little bit of medium term view on that, just given the level of activity, should we expect that to step up even more as we enter next year. I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how much investments is going to be required to support some of the announcement that you\u2019ve recently had here.","Randy Owen","Well, I do think \u2013 couple of things Darren. And so one, there is some pre-work done here obviously if you stand that up, some of that will become part of the joint venture and shared cost if you will, once that\u2019s done, you will have some revenue that will offset some of that. I don\u2019t expect that Darren dramatically increase, obviously, we got a lot of resources here health and that kind of set that up from both organization. So look it would a little higher, I think it could but I don\u2019t see anything dramatic on that front.","We have said, I think before that if you look at the extension joint venture when we first talked about it that, we would anticipate that in the first year, margins are going to be lower as we do kind of bring that up and then sort of reshape some of those operations and bring some of the tools that we have to that, to help enhance margins, but that over time whether that\u2019s a year more that you would get into more of your traditional margin. So, I would necessarily call that start-up cost, but I think you would see a bit of that in that business as you stand that up.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Got it that\u2019s helpful. And then the other hand just I want to ask you\u2019ve talked about earlier in the year, some of your customers in EmCare the new contracts winning could, I guess start up a little bit more rapidly, curious to know if there is anything in the pipeline where that\u2019s true and if, you are still, you\u2019ve been successful in getting the subsidy upfront to offset that?","Randy Owen","One other things that we have been specific about was that, we\u2019re not going to turn away business, if there is a request or a need for a quick start. But we\u2019ve been very successful with hospital partners either absorbing that on a very short start-up or sharing the cost with us, if it\u2019s less than 90 days start-up. So that\u2019s right, you\u2019ve been very successful for us and we think that\u2019s going to be our strategy on the go forward basis. There is really no pushback.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, good. But the last thing I had is, the one thing that\u2019s certainly has been a really positive surprise is just the AMR organic growth and maybe you comment this a little bit more earlier Randy, I may have missed it, but just can you give us a feel for IFT market demand and what you\u2019re seeing there and just some of the volume puts and takes inside that business?","Randy Owen","Well I think Darren, one of things that, I think you\u2019re right that we\u2019re seeing is, obviously some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen so far here is been obviously on the 911 side with the new contracts. But in the past we did have pressure on the non-emergency side and we had really seen that abate and we\u2019re actually seeing some growth on that side. And I think Darren, it\u2019s just around we restructured again the operations, we restructured the sales teams, we restructured sort of our deployment to make sure that we can respond to a call from a hospital to transfer a patient, and in that side of the business if you are not able to respond, there are other choices and they will find someone else.","So, I think we\u2019ve been much more responsive to customer demands. We have seen more, hospital system deals, so we are, as we\u2019re presenting even on the EmCare side with certain health systems and going on. We\u2019re also obviously talking with them about the benefits of not only the AMR business and what we can do on the \u2013 in their facility and in some cases readmission, obviously what we can do on the Evolution Health side as well.","So, we are seeing some positive growth there and it\u2019s really, I think just taking share from others it\u2019s not necessarily a dramatic change and for the growth in the business. And one of the important elements that we\u2019ve highlighted, but not really spent much time, was the investment in technology particularly the [indiscernible] system, which as greatly enhanced our deployment strategy, which allows us with less resources frankly to respond in a lower, response time. And that\u2019s been very effective in terms of winning new customers, at the same time taking resources off the road. So that\u2019s been the real driver as well as changing our whole marketing approach and our sales approach. So, we think we\u2019ve got, great runway ahead of us for AMR.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, okay thanks a lot.","Randy Owen","Thanks Darren.","Operator","Our next and final question over the phone comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hey just had one quick follow up, Randy I was wondering if you have any update on the medical transportation efforts in Arizona with that CON?","Randy Owen","Well, its \u2013 Kevin I think all of the presentations have been made, the hearings are made, it\u2019s now I think in the judges sort of hands if you will for approval on that. Obviously, we feel very good about the case we\u2019ve made for having another provider. I do expect that to probably, whether we may hear that by the end of this month or more like or could be even in December. But now we\u2019re sort been waiting for decision.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, sounds good. Thank you.","Randy Owen","Thank you.","Operator","And we have another question over the phone from Mr. Ralph Jacoby from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Ralph Jacoby \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks good afternoon. I guess first, can you talk a little bit more about the insurance expense in the quarter, came in, I think 43 million lower than what we had estimated and certainly been that degree on the sequential quarter basis. And maybe just talk about the better performance, sort of what drove that, the sustainable run rate from sort of absolute dollar basis or maybe from a sort of margin perspective? Thanks.","Randy Owen","Yes I think, Ralph a couple of things that we\u2019re seeing, one, I do think that in, time I think will help, obviously solidify that, but I do think one, some of the additional volume that we\u2019re seeing as I said is, lower acuity and so we do believe that the risk, of that volume is lower. So, as we\u2019ve looked at claims that have been filed this year, we\u2019ve been very pleased with kind of what we\u2019ve seen so far, especially in relation to sort of the volume growth. So, some of its driven from that, I mentioned some of that is, we\u2019ve continued to focus on risk management, processes and protocols in our hospitals and all of our new contracts. Our team actually won an award recently at national [indiscernible] annual convention for innovation around sort of risk management.","So, we\u2019re very active and proactive around that. So, I think you got two of those main things, one is that and the other is I do believe that some of the volume that we\u2019re seeing is not at the same risk level, as we may have seen in the past. So, look it sometimes it does, move around. But I think if you look at it, I do think it\u2019s lower than what we\u2019ve seen before and in some cases we\u2019ve seen it more in a 3% range probably closer to more of that, 2% to 2.5% range. And so, I think those are the drivers.","Ralph Jacoby \u2013 Credit Suisse","So just from modeling perspective going forward, we should think if it is 2% in this 2.5% range?","Randy Owen","Based on what we\u2019re seeing now, I think that\u2019s right. So, some of our growth is also been, obviously the part of the HCA joint venture, as well and so that risk is done through their program, which is a pretty cost effective program as well as for those contracts. So, looking to move around a little bit, but I think that\u2019s fair.","Ralph Jacoby \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just my, and then one follow-up here, did the transitional care programs and the UHS deal, can you help us all at all in terms of the how the economics actually work on \u2013 on these deals just unclear sort of the, I mean who does the UHS pay you the revenue, do you book the revenue from on a fee-for-service basis, I\u2019m just unclear sort of the economics of some of these deals?","Randy Owen","Sure, and they vary, somewhat Ralph depending upon the relationship, and depending upon the facilities relationship with being out with the health plan. If it\u2019s a Medicare patients there is lot in a health plan, say Medicare advantage or if you are eligible generally we work with the transitional care program and define a care plan for that patient then build the fee-for-service for the period of time be a 30 days, 90 days or frankly the patients the chronic in nature could be for the life of the patients with them.","In other areas, we\u2019re looking at bundle post-acute bundle payment, where we do take some risk with the hospital and that was cases, we would share, we would basically have our cost, we\u2019d share some of the benefit with the hospital relative to those discharges. Our preferred model frankly is to have adequate number of patients to take the bundle payment for post-acute care and that\u2019s the ultimate goal with the Evolution Health.","Ralph Jacoby \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Randy Owen","There are no further questions over the phone at this time. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.","Bill Sanger","Well thank you everyone for your interest in Envision Healthcare."],"8903":["Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.

Now, I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Craig Wilson, General Counsel. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Wilson","Thank you. Welcome everyone to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2015. Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and actual results may vary materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors section of our most recently-filed annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q to be filed in the coming weeks. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this morning, along with our remarks today, are made as of today, October 22, 2015 and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included in our press release issued this morning which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website. All comparisons included in our presentation today are for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, to the same periods in 2014, unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","Bill Sanger","Thank you, Craig; and good morning, everyone. I appreciate so many of you joining the call this morning, especially with the short notice. Early this morning, we issued our third quarter results for Envision Healthcare which, quite frankly, were disappointing. Envision's revenue was 19% higher for the third quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period last year. However, adjusted EBITDA of $142.5 million for the third quarter of 2015, was considerably lower than our guided range. The reasons behind the miss are isolated to certain operational challenges at our EmCare Physician Services segment.","I'm now going to take some time to discuss the details behind EmCare's results, as well as the initiatives we have taken to mitigate the impact during Q4 and beyond. Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the unfavorable results for expectations is specific to the EmCare division. Results at both AMR and Evolution Health were essentially in line with our forecast. We have exciting news to share with you after Randy's comments.","During the quarter, EmCare's results were negatively impacted by decelerating same-store volume growth which resulted in higher staffing ratios and certain underperforming contracts. I will address each of these issues.","First, volume. During the quarter, we experienced a lower rate of volume growth. At 2.6% growth from the prior year, third quarter same-store volume was positive; however, below the levels we have experienced in past quarters. EmCare's same-store volume exceeded 6% in recent quarters and EmCare's emergency department volume growth has been as high as 7 percentage points. For the third quarter of 2015, at our same-store emergency department contracts, our growth was only 1.8%.","Early in the quarter, the ED volume appeared to be tracking to seasonally lower July levels. When those levels did not increase in August as anticipated, we responded by initiating staffing schedule changes across all service lines. While those adjustments will help to offset some of the impact of slower volume growth, EmCare's staffing schedules are generally set 45 to 60 days in advance.","These schedules are based on anticipated volumes and hospital staffing level commitments. When volume trends shift, there's a lag in time before we're able to flex our staffing or to go back to the hospital so we can renegotiate these contracts to align with the changes in the volume.","The combination of lower than forecasted volume growth, the lags in staffing changes and the contract renegotiation process, accounted for same store negative EBITDA variance in the quarter of almost $17 million relative to our forecast. At this time, based on current volumes and anticipated seasonal trends, we have modified provider work schedules and we anticipate a favorable impact in the latter part of Q4. We're also confident that our contract renegotiation process on subsidized agreements will result in a partial recovery of the financial performance of these contracts and position us well going into 2016.","Second challenge, underperforming contracts. There were a certain group of contracts that had significantly performed below our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA loss on these contracts were approximately $6.5 million, while we had expected a positive adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million on these contracts, resulting in a negative $10 million variance. These contracts have either been renegotiated to bring us to acceptable levels or are scheduled for termination in Q4. The financial impact of the contracts that have been terminated alone, including some that will be affected this quarter, should result in a sequential improvement to EBITDA of approximately $6 million to $7 million in Q4.","Notwithstanding the challenges I just described, we're managing through them effectively. On a year-to-year basis, Envision generated revenue of over $4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $434 million. I can now turn it over to Randy for a review of our financial results. Randy?","Randy Owen","Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly walk through our financial results for the quarter and provide some comments on our outlook. Revenue in the quarter of $1.37 billion grew by 18.9%, but adjusted EBITDA of $142.5 million was down by 7.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4% declined 300 basis points.","Operating income was $60 million and this includes the $30 million expense accrual for our estimated exposure to previously announced litigation related to EmCare services provided at Health Management Associates' facilities. Our discussions with the Government have progressed to a point that we believe it is appropriate to record this reserve in the quarter. We believe that we have committed no wrongdoing in this matter. However, to avoid protracted litigation, we're working with the Government to definitively resolve this matter and expect to finalize it in the near future.","While this reserve is included in the Company's operating income, it is excluded from our reported adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our existing definition as noted in our press release. Envision's adjusted EBITDA EPS was $0.30 which compares with $0.35 last year; and GAAP EPS of $0.09 which compares to $0.28.","EmCare's revenue of $933.9 million grew by 24.8% or 21.5% when excluding strong year-over-year growth from Evolution Health. Total revenue growth was driven by acquisition-related growth of 16.1%, net new contract growth of 6.9% and same-store revenue growth of 1.8%. On a same-store contract basis, revenue grew by 2.1% of EmCare, consisting of 2.6% volume growth, offset by a decline in rate of 0.5% primarily due to the loss of Medicaid parity in 2015 and a slight increase in our self-pay mix.","While we saw positive rate growth from rate increases, those were offset by the loss of parity revenue which was $9.5 million in Q3 of 2014 and an increase of self-pay volume of 50 basis points in the quarter and also lower anesthesia yields. Same-store volume growth in our emergency department contracts was 1.8% which, while positive, was at a lower rate of growth compared with recent periods. Last quarter, for example, we had 4.4% overall volume growth and 4.1% ED volume growth.","During the third quarter of 2015, net new contract growth for EmCare was 6.9% or 3.3% when excluding contract growth from Evolution Health. Revenue from new contract growth was 11.4% and continued to see a robust pipeline. The impact of terminations in 2015 during the third quarter reduced revenue by 8.1%. We anticipate net new contract growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, will be lower than in previous quarters due to the anticipated impact of terminating contracts.","Interest segment adjusted EBITDA was $86.4 million or 9.2% of revenue and compares with $100.9 million or 13.5% in Q3 last year. EmCare's results were impacted by lower than anticipated revenue growth, as I just highlighted and higher compensation in insurance expense. As we stated in this morning's press release, EmCare's revenues and excluding Evolution Health grew about $3.7 million sequentially from Q2 of 2015.","Compensation and benefit expense grew by $14 million sequentially and we had a $4.2 million increase in insurance reserves in the quarter for prior year development. Bill highlighted the key drivers of the compensation challenges. While prior year insurance development was higher than expected on certain cases, the overall claim trends continue to be stable.","In recent quarters, we've highlighted Evolution Health's contribution to EmCare's segment results. Third quarter revenue for Evolution was $58.5 million which is up 113% from the prior year, largely due to the rollout of our joint venture with Ascension. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 million. Through nine months, Evolution has generated revenue of $154.6 million, up 90%; and adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million is up 70%.","Moving to our AMR segment, revenue grew by 7.8% for the quarter to $433.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $56.1 million was up 6.2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin in AMR remains strong at 12.9%. Revenue growth consisted of a net new contract growth of 3.3% and same-market revenue growth of 2.9%. Same-market volume increased by 3.7%, while rate declined slightly by 0.8% due to a slight shift in payer mix.","Acquisition-related revenue growth was 1.6%, related to the operations in Massachusetts that we acquired early in the third quarter. Insurance expense in the third quarter included a $1 million reserve for prior year development versus a $1.3 million benefit in Q3 of 2014, contributing to a 20 basis point reduction in margin.","I want to provide a quick update on Rural\/Metro. The Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination under Hart-Scott-Rodino and we've made excellent progress with other regulatory agencies and are on track to close this transaction this quarter. As part of our committed financing for the transaction, we expect to complete that process shortly now that we have reported our third quarter results.","Cash flow for the third quarter was $34 million, down from $100.1 million, due to lower net income, an increase in DSO and an increase in cash tax payments of approximately $35 million. We had total debt outstanding of $2.2 billion, with that $130 million in cash on our balance sheet at September 30. As noted in our press release, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million over time. We will assess the merits of repurchasing shares and fund any repurchases with operating cash flows and borrowings as needed.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of 2015, we now expect adjusted EBITDA for the year to be in the range of $600 million to $605 million. Adjusted EPS is now expected at $1.28 to $1.30. Obviously, this change to our guidance incorporates our third quarter results as well as the realized anticipated impact of mitigation initiatives in the fourth quarter.","Our fourth quarter results include a sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA primarily in the EmCare segment. This is driven by expected performance improvements including a realignment of staffing ratios, positive impact from contract terminations and overall volume increases from net new contract starts and traditional seasonal trends. We anticipate providing 2016 earnings guidance after the first of the calendar year.","As we look to 2016, I want to provide some initial thoughts on where we see trends in our business, as we will now have lapped the 2014 impacts from health reform. At EmCare, we anticipate same-store revenue growth to be back to traditional levels pre-healthcare reform. We anticipate our organic growth will continue to be driven by new contract starts and have a robust pipeline of contract opportunities. We do anticipate exiting a larger number of underperforming contracts in 2016 and expect to achieve a meaningful improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2016 as well.","Evolution Health also has a significant pipeline of contract opportunities. We expect significant revenue growth from the addition of new Ascension markets into the joint venture, annual impact of new contract starts in Q4 of 2015 and existing contract growth. We anticipate EBITDA margins at Evolution to remain consistent, given the large number of new contract starts.","At AMR, the core business continues to grow as we move forward with our strategy of contracting with health systems and communities. Adjusted EBITDA margin increases will moderate as we have achieved a majority of the benefits from the previously discussed initiatives. We expect to close the Rural\/Metro transaction this quarter and are actively engaged in our integration efforts for the combination. Bill?","Bill Sanger","Thank you, Randy. Continuing on that note, there are many positive developments at the Company. At EmCare, our pipeline for getting opportunities continues to be very robust, with a high interest for integrated service offerings from both individual hospitals as well as health systems.","On the acquisition front, we recently completed the acquisition of Tucson Emergency Medical Group which complements our Scottsdale acquisition we recently announced and moreover, supports our market-centric strategy for EmCare, AMR and Evolution Health in Arizona. We were also pleased with the acquisition pipeline as we're in discussions with numerous large independent groups that are interested in joining Envision primarily because of our full care of continuum of services.","At AMR, we're excited about the expanded opportunities that will come our way with the pending acquisition of Rural\/Metro. As healthcare service models are shifting towards a more coordinated approach, the role of medical transportation clinician is taking on a greater strategic role.","On the Evolution Health front, we continue to build a reputation as being an innovator. On November 1, we will begin managing 50,000-member Medicare Advantage population for a major Florida health payer. Annual revenues on this contract are expected to be approximately $100 million annually. The agreement is one of the first of its kind in the country and includes management of the patients' comprehensive care continuum. We anticipate announcing several other agreements with various health franchises during 2016.","Lastly, on PPCI fronts, on October 1 we added 24 new programs; and today, we're episode initiators in a total of 43 Model 2 and Model 3 programs. Presently, we're managing over $250 million of Medicare spent under this program. Our first reconciliation with CMS is slated for the first quarter of 2016. We're encouraged by the results we're seeing to date.","In closing, we're confident about our mitigation plan and we will be successfully managing through these challenges. We believe that our differentiated services, our market-centric strategy and our integrated care delivery model will continue to present us with multiple avenues for growth in the future.","Operator, at this point I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Josh Raskin","The first place to start is just the staffing pressures on some of these new contracts. This is nationwide. I think we have talked about once or twice in the past, but I'm just surprised at the magnitude. I guess I'm looking for, what's changed on these new contracts? Why are they so unprofitable all of a sudden relative to what you guys have seen? You guys have obviously been doing this for a while. What's new in the market that has changed these new contracts?","Bill Sanger","I'm not sure I would say there's anything new. There were a small set of contracts, approximately 30 contracts, about 21 of those that were -- that came on in the last few quarters that frankly, were underperforming substantially based on the changes and pair mix that we saw, volume we saw and we kind of misread what the cash per visit was.","We believe that over time we were going to be successful in turning these contracts around and as such, we had not reached that target as I shared in my comments. Because of that, we have taken actions to right size those contracts where appropriate and if not, terminate those contracts. They represent a very small portion but a large part of the miss. I would not say anything is new. We ran into a set of frankly, poor execution, poor decision from taking those contracts.","Josh Raskin","But I guess, Bill, is there anything in term of process or change or anything that has gone different? I'm just curious, why all of a sudden these new contracts are so much worse from a payer mix or as you said, cash per visit than you have seen? I mean you guys have been onboarding new contracts every quarter, right?","Bill Sanger","Yes, look. I think that our biggest challenge is staffing, as always has been. Many of these contracts were in areas where staffing is very difficult and we're successful in meeting those staffing needs. Staffing has always been the denominator of this equation.","Josh Raskin","And then next on the volume side, it went really much worse than we were looking for. But I'm just curious, are you seeing any impact from a competitive standpoint? Are there freestanding EDs that are popping up? Have you been able to isolate that relative to markets?","Bill Sanger","Josh, we really haven't seen substantial competition outside of a few markets including Houston and to some degree, Dallas. The challenge for freestanding is competition for the clinician. We see that challenge more on trying to recruit versus them taking patients away from us.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Then last one, just overall a lot going on in the staffing world. One of your biggest competitors has been approached in terms of potential M&A and I'm just curious, I know you have got Rural\/Metro pending. I know you guys are trying to remediate some of these earnings pressures, but how do you think about consolidation and if there were an opportunity to consolidate in a material way the ED staffing business, would that be something attractive to you?","Bill Sanger","Let me first address the challenges. I'm confident that this challenge that we have experienced in Q3 will resolve through Q4. We have taken definitive action. We have schedules in place. We have renegotiations in place. Our poor execution has been noted and we're moving in the right direction. We're always are looking at opportunities. We believe there's an opportunity in the marketplace that improves our ability to provide care and also improves shareholder value. We're certainly looking at it very seriously.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, could you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on how much -- you reference payer mix was an issue contributing to EmCare either on the top line or I guess more particularly, on the bottom line?","Randy Owen","If you look at, again, I think if you look at quarter-over quarter, okay and where you have a slight rate decline on both EmCare and AMR, especially on the EmCare side, that's really primarily just from a year-over-year, driven by the reduction of parity. We have talked earlier in the year that our anesthesia yields have been lower as we have been changing that business and the billing aspects of that, that we have been changing to another provider that we have talked about in past. If you look at the one thing that we saw in the third quarter, is sequentially. ","So when you think about Q2 and payer mix, we did see a slight tick up in the self-pay. Payer mix is about 50 basis points. I wouldn't say that it was a material change. We didn't see a material change in payers but again, little changes in each of those and a small change in self-pay does have an impact. I don't have an exact number on the top of my head in terms of the actual flow through EBITDA impact of the 50 basis point change, but again, it was a factor in the overall quarter performance.","Matthew Borsch","As you try to back up and think about the higher level trend here, what do you think is going on that is caused the self-pay mix to be perhaps a bit higher than you expected given everything that's going on in your markets with ACA coverage and broader coverage trends I should say?","Randy Owen","Matt, look, this is something that just changed this quarter. I don't know that you have enough information to know whether this is a longer trend or a shorter blip. It is clearly within our band of what can happen seasonally or can happen from time to time. So I don't know that we've not seen anything at this point that would say there's more a permanent change in how we think about generally our payer mix.","Matthew Borsch","Last question, maybe this isn't an issue because it would be more elective. But do you see any impact from the timing of the calendar this particular third quarter? I.et the longer summer, the late Labor Day versus a very early Labor Day a year ago?","Randy Owen","It is hard to say. Look, just from base standpoint, obviously you had one extra business day or one extra day in the calendar this quarter. That obviously affects some of the sequential compensation increases because you had an extra day of coverage.","While you would have an extra day of revenue, again and where volumes were a little softer, that didn't come through. I can't say that because of the calendar and Labor Day and all that, that that would have had a meaningful change. There's nothing that we have seen that would point directly to that.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of AJ Rice from UBS. Your line is now open.","AJ Rice","As you guys have talked about growth, you have broken it down historically and the same store growth, the new contract win growth and the acquisitions. As you think about it today in light of the third quarter, do you make modifications in any of those buckets in terms of your expectations for growth going forward?","Randy Owen","I mentioned a minute ago on my, in my talking points here, from a longer term perspective. Obviously, we will come back later with more specific thoughts around 2016 guidance. But from a macro, I think again, same store volumes, we still expect be positive but probably reverting more to the longer term historical trends.","Obviously, we've seen higher same store volume growth from the impact of health reform and now that we've lapped that, we think that goes back to the more normal longer term trends. From a same store standpoint, again, if you look at it from a longer term perspective, I don't see it as being that different. Obviously different from the last year because of health reform. When you look at the contract side, the new contract pipeline is still robust.","We're still seeing very positive growth from new contracts. I think in the nearer term and into next year, because of as Bill mentioned, some of the things where we're right-sizing some contracts and some of those include terminating unprofitable contracts that we can't restructure, then your net number will be a little lower because of that. But we're not seeing a reduced demand, if you will, for services or multiple services in our business.","AJ Rice","Okay. Alright. And then on the contract, I know you have talked about this, but thinking about contracts where you've had issues and had to terminate or structure, is there any common theme in there? Is there anything you have learned that will make sure you don't get in those contracts again? Can we -- are they tend be JVs? Do they tend to be one type of region or type of operator? Any color on that?","Randy Owen","A couple of things. One, some of those contracts that Bill mentioned where we had acute difference in the performance, there were probably a little over half of those were with a smaller system that we have been involved with. That's more of where, what we probably in terms of assessing what the expected volume, the demographics, coverage requirements, the ability to recruit, with all this effort, we missed that.","So that does cause you to make sure that -- part of what we've done is make sure that as you're looking at that, we're really confident in the information that we get from facilities that that is accurate and we can recruit and staff appropriately. And so as Bill said, there were some other contracts that were just in areas that were difficult to recruit.","And I think we underestimated the challenges initially of the recruitment process and ended up paying a much higher rate for temporary staffing because of what we'd committed from a hospital standpoint than we had expected.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from -- here is Mr. Ryan Daniels again from William Blair. Sir, your line is now open.","Ryan Daniels","Randy, maybe a follow-up question for you. Just trying to get a feel for the EmCare contracts. As you look at your portfolio, either number of contracts or percent of EmCare sales, how much of the portfolio is underperforming from a margin standpoint as we try to think about how to calibrate our 2016 numbers for those higher levels of portfolio culling, if you will?","Randy Owen","It is a much smaller percentage of the total book of business. I can't give you a specific percentage. You always have, as anyone would, with your total contract base, you have some that perform better than others. We clearly had a lot of these were starts within the last 12 months that had much bigger issues than we had anticipated.","So, Ryan, I would not say there's a pervasive issue across all contracts. We've clearly had some, as Bill noted, some delays in making adjustments to staffing based on the volume that we saw, but from a truly kind of underperforming, it is a pretty small percentage.","Ryan Daniels","I guess the follow-up there, is the Vista department or division helping with your staffing now that you own that and have some welcome tenants or is that really not big enough to have an impact if you look at your global operations?","Bill Sanger","Vista is obviously having a positive impact. Keep in mind that in addition to servicing EmCare for some of this temporary need, it also services other staff, temporary staffing for hospitals and other providers as well. But it is certainly making a positive impact. We think over time if it grows and then recruits more positions, it will be a more positive impact.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of other Mr. Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich","I guess just following up again on the contracts, just wanted to clarify, are all of the contracts that you are experiencing issues with ED or is it -- are there other specialties that are involved here?","Bill Sanger","It is right now primarily ED, primarily related to mismatch of staffing to volume.","Kevin Ellich","Okay.","Bill Sanger","I say this, there's a silver lining here. We're not having revenue issues here. We're growing. There are great opportunities out there. This is an expense issue. This is an execution issue which is much -- we can aggressively go after the challenges here and resolve them much more quicker than if it was a revenue problem.","Kevin Ellich","And then looking at your AMR business which has been performing very nicely. This quarter it looks like pricing or rate was actually down 0.8% versus seeing some pricing increases the last few quarters. Wondering what's going on with the pricing for the medical transportation business?","Randy Owen","Look, no major change there. If you will recall in the past, some of the pricing like we have seen, is in some parts of the business that where you don't have volume so it all goes to rate. So while that business is still there and still performing, the change year over year wasn't as significant which sometimes impacts that pricing.","It was really again, Government reimbursement is fairly flat from that standpoint where we did see some impact from fee increases, there was some slight change in payer mix. Again, no major changes that gave you that just under 1% pricing decline.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. Then, Randy just one last thing. I understand now that this is more of an expense and execution issue versus revenue volumes were actually similar I think to what Josh said, in line with what we're expecting. If you look at the three components you guys called out; decelerating volume growth, staffing and underperforming contracts, could you quantify in those three buckets where the miss came from relative to your expectations?","Randy Owen","Yes, let me just go that again and Bill had that in some of his talking points which you can see with the transcript when that comes out. So one, if you look at, in what we think of as same store contracts, again, in primarily on the ED side where you had a change in the volume growth where the volume was a little softer in Q3 and changes in staffing were lagged. As Bill noted, that was about a $17 million impact in the quarter from an EBITDA perspective.","Kevin Ellich","Okay.","Randy Owen","Those contracts that we have talked about that had a more acute issue, a lot of them were recent starts in the last 12 months. Those were the ones in the press release you see have actual losses of $6.5 million and we had expected some profit. That's about a $10 million impact.","And then when you look at the insurance, again, we just happened to have a negative trend on the prior development. That was about $4 million. When you look at lose three pieces, those really are make up to roughly the $30 million that where EmCare was different than expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","On the lower volume to start, any specific geographies you would call out? And then just sticking on the top line, can you help on what pricing would have been if you exclude parity? Because parity was included last quarter as well and you still had pricing up around 1.5% and now we're down 50 BPs. I'm just trying to reconcile the 200 basis point deceleration in pricing and an incremental driver above and beyond the volume side in terms of the margin pressure.","Randy Owen","Well, Ralph. I guess, a couple of things. So one, from a parity standpoint, we kind of put out the number that was about remember, $9.5 million in Q3 of 2014. You don't have anything there. That's the main impact of that just change quarter over quarter. Again, small change in the self-pay mix on a sequential basis.","Self-pay's still lower than last year obviously given the overall health reform and the impacts that we saw over the last couple of years. But a little bit of movement from Q2 and then we also had as we have had lower anesthesia yields, given what we have talked about before on those.","So those, when you look at really the combination of those, those really somewhat offset what were more normal improvements to yield around normal fee increases and those kind of things. I don't have a specific number to say okay, here is a break down right now of here's what the rate increases and what that is from a positive offset by those three components from a negative standpoint.","On a volume, your question on the volume, I don't know of anything specific geographies on that. I wouldn't say there was just one part of the country that was dramatically different than another.","Unidentified Analyst","And then you guys sited the DSO increase and that number's bounced around a little bit. So just wanted to understand in the press release, you talked about a temporary delays from certain payers. I just want to understand maybe what that means and how quickly that can get resolved?","Bill Sanger","We were in negotiations with a particular payer and what we were doing, we were holding a lot of those bills or I should say we were holding all of the bills for this particular payer while we went through the negotiation process. We ended that process favorably for both parties and that did have an effect on our DSO because it is a very large payer.","Randy Owen"," And the other piece of that, Ralph, was so you had that, that Bill mentioned, as well as on Vista where we, that we actually did hold and we were going through a conversion onto our system. So it was more of a timing issue of where we held that to make sure the conversion standpoint everything went successfully which it did. And those have now been all released and so we would expect those two items to come back in fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then if I could just squeeze one more in? Just in terms of other the pressures are in relatively new contracts? Is that correct? I'm trying to understand how do you renegotiate those contracts when you just took them on and\/or potentially terminate them when they're relatively new? Is there any concern there on the ability other to capture new contracts with the quick turnover? The other piece of that is, are some of these pressures because of other subsidy related where maybe you were just willing to let go of the subsidy where historically, you would look for a subsidy given the expectation of reform and the potential benefit of payer mix change?","Bill Sanger","Well, there are a couple of questions here. Let me begin with when we enter into a contract, we look at a certain number of data points. And it is important to get those data points correct. Number one, the market rate for the physicians in that area, the cash per visit we're expected, the payer mix we're expected and we rely heavily upon the data that's provided by the hospital. At times that's incomplete and we have to make assumptions on those factors.","With the group of contracts with a particular hospital system, we had data that was inconsistent that resulted in upside down contracts. Of the 30 contracts that were underperforming that I had mentioned in my presentation, 21 of those were from that one system.","We have since renegotiated or canceled those contracts. Now, into the future, we're going to be very cautious of the information that's provided for us versus validation through our system of actually going through every chart and looking at what the payer mix, the payer shift might be, looking at cash per visit, looking at rates for physicians, the ability to recruit that area.","Keep in mind, that these contracts represent 30 contracts out of our hundreds and hundreds of contracts. But, these were very underperforming contracts. Now as it relates to how the process is negotiated, once we find out we can't meet expectations, we usually have 90-day exit period. When we enter a contract, we typically don't like to leave and we'll take a loss as we look at ways to improve that contract.","If we're unsuccessful, then we will go through a 90-day process and inform the hospitals that we're going to be leaving. At times, very often, the hospital will basically say we will increase the subsidy, we'll give you subsidy if you stay. In other times, they basically will allow us to leave. So it is a process. One that we're comfortable with. One that we found ourselves in this last quarter, in a box and it was primarily due to poor execution on our part.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jason Gordon from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Jason Gordon","I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on your overlap with TeamHealth and the overall competitive environment for ED staffing in general?","Bill Sanger","If you look at the marketplace, Jason, there's still quite a bit of outsourcing opportunities. Now, we generally do see competitors when we have an RFP but by and large, there's a couple or three competitors when RFPs come out. There is some overlap but if you look at the growth profiles, all the companies are growing new contracts I think quite favorably. I would say that for most of the RFPs that come out, we do see TeamHealth, particularly on the ED side, as well as some regional providers.","Jason Gordon","Do you have a sense that there are or that there is not specific geographies where it is only the two of you or is that not the case?","Bill Sanger","There are certainly geographies where there is just TeamHealth and EmCare. There aren't a lot of those though.","Jason Gordon","Okay. And I was hoping you could maybe provide a few additional details on the new Evolution Health contract with 50,000 members?","Bill Sanger","Sure. That contract is with a payer in Florida. It is for 60,000 Medicare Advantage providers or patients. We're basically get a PMPM. However, they're unique in that the reimbursement scheme is very similar to a bundle payment. What's unique about the approach is that our reimbursement is really will increase as we're effectively managing the transitions of care. And the real profit is really made on the high risk patients.","Our approach is utilizing all three companies, including a medical command center, a unique medical command center that we have several, three throughout the country. We monitor these patients on real-time basis. We manage unscheduled care and as importantly, we really focus on the high risk patients within that population.","And that's frankly, where we make the highest profit margin by managing the medical loss ratio. This is again, a lot of interest by other health plans and we're very encouraged about the interest and believe that we will see substantial announcements going through 2016 about these types of plans.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mr. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Just a question for you about how to think about the base number for 2015? I understand you're not giving 2016 guidance, but you provided guidance last quarter and you provided guidance this quarter. And you talked about some things that are one-time like insurance charge, some things that seem temporary in nature as far as the labor cost issue, but some things which seem they are going to impact go forward earnings like actually exiting contracts that you thought were going to be profitable this quarter and in the future.","Is there anyway to think about how much of the guidance reduction is actually temporary versus an ongoing number? Where between last quarter's guidance and this quarter's guidance is the way to think about the base when we think about growing in the future?","Randy Owen","Kevin, a couple of thoughts and I will see if Bill wants to add to that. One, if you look at most of those items that we described in terms of those separate components in terms of the same store challenges from a staffing and volume, those contracts that we have described. The insurance, you've followed us a long time, insurance is generally pretty stable.","Sometimes it is better and sometimes it is worse. I don't think there's anything that different. I would think that $4 million is unusual that you have that much of a negative at one period of time. The trends are pretty stable.","Most of those, I do think are temporary. If you look at that and what Bill described is, we know we can make adjustments to staffing to right-size that on the volume basis. Obviously, those acute contracts that Bill talked and we have already taken definitive action on that as well as the overall staffing we talked about on the same stores.","All of those, as Bill mentioned, are correctable. Those don't happen in one month but we do see actions have already been taken to start seeing that improvement. For example, you mentioned some of those underperforming contracts. We actually had losses. So upon termination of that, that clearly will improve the overall EBITDA. So, no, we don't see any those as long-term systemic issues that change our thinking around the business opportunities at EmCare.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess, is there a way to put the contracts that you actually are, have already or plan to terminate, is there a way to put a revenue number around that so we can think about our revenue growth assumption into next year?","Randy Owen","Kevin, off the top of my head, I don't have that revenue number on those contracts at the moment. We will have to look at that. Clearly, as we think about them, as we put out our 2016 guidance, we will provide additional information around that impact in terms of really what's -- where the path where we talked about net new contracts, our plan is to break that out and be able to show you here is what we see as a contract growth standpoint and here is the impact of terminations from right-sizing these contracts. So we will provide additional color as we go through our guidance process.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. It's also on share repurchase versus doing deals? You mentioned that your pipeline is still very strong. You mentioned you'd be interested amongst large scale M&A if that opportunity came up. How invested can you be or should you be on share repurchase? I understand the stock could look pretty cheap but what's your thought process there?","Randy Owen","Kevin, I think it is another tool from a capital deployment perspective. That's the way we look at that. We'll look at these opportunities and depending on where the share repurchase price is, we may think that's a better return. Obviously, we're very confident in the business. So we wanted to have that additional tool to look at that from a capital standpoint. But we will evaluate that along with other investments whether it is other acquisitions or others in terms of where we think the best opportunity is from an investment perspective.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay and last question. You gave some comments about what same contract roads should look like. How do you think about new contracts though? I understand 2016 might not look this way because of the terminations you're doing now, but over the next three to five years, what do you think the opportunity is as far as net to contract growth on average over that time period?","Randy Owen","It is it is hard to say exactly what number to give you over the next three to five years. I guess how I would answer that would be is, when you look at new contract growth, we're still seeing a very robust pipeline. So the pipeline that we're seeing is still consistent with what we've seen here in the past.","So we know the demand is still there for the services. I think in the near-term, to your point, net new which nets determinations will be a lower net percentage because of some of the right-sizing that we're doing with this.","Longer-term, I think you won't see a consistent higher level of terminations. I think we will do that and right-size that book of business so that will have a shorter term impact on that. Now, what that also, as I mentioned here, is we do expect and again, we will do that when we get through guidance is, we do believe that these actions that we're taking and right-sizing those will have a favorable margin improvement impact through EmCare next year as well.","Operator","Next can question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","Just a few quick questions to go through. Just one on the contract terminations. Who assumes these contracts when you guys exit? As one of the largest national players with scale, with recruiting scale, if you guys can't be profitable on the current mix and it really would require a subsidy which sounds like maybe so these unwilling to give you, where do you think these contracts end up? These hospitals take these in house or other just trade them through a few more outsource contracts?","Bill Sanger","I think it is a combination of both. There are providers out there that are not publicly traded companies that will take a 2% or 3% margin business. We want margins that are consistent with what we target for EmCare. Some of these are upside down contracts but some of those are also low margin contracts that if we can't get to our target margin, then we'll exit. There will always be someone to take a 2% or 3% margin out there in the marketplace. Be it somebody who's looking just to grow in the geographic areas or a local group that's satisfied with taking a salary and making a 2% or 3% margin on top of that.","Gary Taylor","I just wanted to make sure I had, I understood your comments exactly but you had said self-pay makes plus 50 basis points year-over-year. Is that self-pay percent of net revenue and that's year-over-year, not sequential and that's percent of net revenue after bad debt?","Randy Owen","Let me clarify. What I'm talking about that, that 50 basis point change was a sequential change from Q2 of 2015. When you look at overall, we still have the overall trend of where self-pay today is lower than it was a year or two ago given health reform. But the change in mix that I mentioned there and that's on volume, Gary. So as we look at that mix, that's really on -- so our volume mix we had slight increase in self-pay patients in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter.","Gary Taylor","Okay. That's what I was after even more was the volume versus the revenue. So, I appreciate that. Last question, just going to the litigation charge, I guess my memory isn't serving me well. I remember some subpoenas around HMA. I'm not sure I remember lawsuits. That may just be my fault. But, the question is, is this in those or is this just an estimated reserve or against an estimated liability that still needs to be finalized?","Bill Sanger","We're going to have Craig Wilson, our General Counsel, answer that question, Gary.","Craig Wilson","So, it's a reserve against, for the liability we expect to have from those lawsuits and our public filing have mentioned the fact that there are a couple of lawsuits out there relating to the HMA book of business for a little while now. The reserve doesn't end the lawsuit. We're trying to resolve that and hope they get that done pretty quickly.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Andrew Schenker","On Evolution, just a follow-up. You're clearly going to see some pretty significant growth next year. Maybe help us summarize some of these drivers or known contracts that you have highlighted already. I have for instance, the annualization of Ascension, growth in Las Vegas, now Florida, what other big contracts are the mix? And then related to that, what's the contribution going forward? Based on your margin comments, should we assume these new contracts lose money as they ramp and that will offset some growth in the older contracts? How should we think about those two portions of it playing out? Thank you.","Bill Sanger","There are two aspects of the growth that we thought the joint venture with Ascension Health to work with them and manage post-acute. That's going quite favorably. We intend to add new markets in the neighborhood of around $70 million new markets top line revenue going into 2016.","The health plans, because we're under NDAs and negotiations, are for similar types of membership. There are a couple of health plans that we're in discussions with that are over100,000 member lives per health plan. We believe that these plans are in different geographic areas and as we scale up, initially, it will see low margins on this business and over time, the margins business will increase as we're able to reduce the medical loss ratio.","The uniqueness is that we're able the deploy resources from all three sides of the Company in order to manage that medical loss ratio and perhaps the most effective DND unplanned care management through a medical command center.","Andrew Schenker","Can you just remind us, where can margins go on these businesses once you get fully ramped? You really get your teeth into them. I mean how high can margins really go eventually?","Bill Sanger","I think in the 10% to 12% each business. This either large contracts and generally speaking. I doubt that the health plans are going to allow us to make 20%, 30% margins. It will come back and try to squeeze us as we improve the [indiscernible] ratios. But I feel comfortable saying that there will be in that low double-digit once we're grow and mature and are successful in reducing MLS.","Randy Owen","One last quick point, we do not anticipate those contracts to actually lose money day one. Again, they're lower margin. If you look at Evolution margins which they are a little lower, it is a function of that in the new start. As well as, we're bringing on some really talented resources here that as we're growing and seeing these growths. So we have invested in infrastructure. We definitely see over time, Evolution Health margins improving.","Andrew Schenker","And then just lastly, I know we have talked about this a lot on the call, but your guidance for 2015, you cut guidance for the year by $60 million. You only missed a clear by $30 million. You have talked through it in several questions here but it seems like you've got initiatives in place.","Obviously, it won't all come back day one, but a lot of those losses should be mitigating through this quarter. Is the $30 million just you being conservative here and ideally you outperform or are there certain aspects or other costs that are causing the cutting guidance for Q4 to be similar to Q3? Thanks.","Randy Owen","And as we've looked at that, the goal is yes, that the guidance is conservative and that we can outperform that guidance. There isn't anything else specific to that that is a big negative or an offset to that. We looked at this as saying, where are we now in terms of third quarter? We clearly see sequential improvement in the quarter. When you look at where we're, the challenges we had this quarter and some of those turnarounds, is where we see that sequential improvement.","We do think the bigger impact of that ends up being fully realized in 2016. You will get some piece of that in the fourth quarter but most of that comes through fully in 2017. We have a pretty, as you can tell, a big step up in our EBITDA.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Gary Lieberman","I guess just going back to the contracts where you had the issues, the newer contracts where you had the issues, were you bidding against other providers for those contracts? And should we be at all concerned that the market has become tighter, has become more competitive and you are having to potentially accept lower margins in order to win those contracts?","Bill Sanger","There is always, it is unusual outside of the joint venture there, that we're just quote given the contract. Even the joint venture is a competitive process. This is a case where, I'll be frank with you, we misread on at least 20 of these 30 contracts. We misunderstood the data.","This is not something that happens on a routine basis but for a fair book of these business, the information that we had derived from the system was inadequate and was missing a lot of information that we had to make assumptions that were incorrect. Then our execution on those contracts were inconsistent, did not meet the expectations. It's rare to have those many over that period of time that haven't turned positive. But this is why we took the action at the end of Q3 to either terminate the contract or tell the hospital that we needed a subsidy based on new information that we have gotten from the charts.","Randy Owen","Some of other these also were in smaller communities from rural areas and clearly, we misread for the ability to recruit and misread in some of those, how many providers we would have day one. It was a much bigger challenge from a recruiting and had a much higher cost of staffing. So, that's part of what we would look at in terms of taking a careful look in those areas especially rural areas where it may be harder to recruit to make sure we have that identified properly.","Gary Lieberman","Maybe just a follow-up on your comments on the volumes. It sounded like you had expected the volumes to pick up in August and the rest of the quarter and it just didn't happen. Do you feel like we're back to normal or is it the potential that we continue to see volumes at the slower rate? You obviously aren't the only ones that have seen volumes slowdown in the quarter. It was clearly somewhat pervasive throughout the industry. But what leads you to believe that we should be getting back to whatever that more normal baseline volume growth is?","Randy Owen","If you look at over the longer-term outside of the last couple of years, we have typically seen volumes in that plus or minus 3% range. Over a much longer term, that's what we have seen. To some extent, that's some of what I think we saw here, especially as your comping into quarters last year which I think even had a 6% volume growth because of the reform impact. I do think over time, we have felt that way that volumes do come back to the mean in terms of the longer-term trends.","Operator","Next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo","Just back to your comments on self-pay and the mix, are you seeing anything geographically different in expansion versus non-expansion states and just any comment on perhaps Texas and Florida with self-pay volumes year-over-year?","Randy Owen","Let me start there. First of all, if you look at the self-pay, it is a change, but a 50 basis point sequential change is not a huge material difference on how we see the world and where things are going. It was a bit of a change and that's why we highlighted that.","Specifically, I don't remember Florida or Texas, the specific numbers. There's nothing that I have heard that says there was a much different change in the mix in those states. I don't have those numbers in front of me.","Whit Mayo","Back to the net new contract growth, how much of that came from existing customers within the quarter?","Randy Owen","Whit, I'm sorry. I don't have that one in front of me. We have seen in recent quarters and we will see if we can get some of that information where contract growth with existing customers has generally been more in the 30% to 40% range. I think that's probably a pretty close number. There wasn't any major change either up or down in that trend. But I don't have the specific percentage.","Whit Mayo","When you look at the 20 to 30 underperforming contracts that you onboarded and exited or restructured, how much of those were existing customers or bundled contracts?","Randy Owen","Some of other those, as Bill mentioned, I guess from a customer standpoint, some of those were with a smaller system that we've had a relationship with. So, in if you think of it from a systems standpoint then, a number of those other were with an existing relationship. The others were really more of a mix. Most of those were ED and were a mix of just different customers. Most of those were newer customers.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Last question, just back to the anesthesia issue that you've had for two or three quarters now, what was that headwind within the third quarter and do you anticipate that collection issue to be resolved by the end of the year?","Randy Owen","Yes, I do. We're in that transition process now. From a rate standpoint, that in and of itself, I think hit us for probably about $5 million to $6 million from a rate standpoint. That's not that different from Q2 for sequential but when you look year-over-year, that's the number that we have been seeing each quarter. Now as we get, as we finalize the transition of those which will happen this year, then we do believe we will see obviously improved collections and we'll be able to improve that yield.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Richard Close from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Richard Close","Just really quick questions, on the smaller system that you talked about, 21 contracts I believe you mentioned there, how many other contracts does that customer have and are those profitable?","Bill Sanger","We have about five additional in addition to the 20 to 21 actually. Those are profitable.","Richard Close","Okay. And my follow-up would be, with respect to the terminated contracts, did you give a specific number for the third quarter, how many you did exit and how that compares to the second quarter?","Randy Owen","No, we did not. But there wasn't a significant difference in terms of actual contracts that were terminated in the third quarters. Some of those when you look at quarter-over quarter net new sales, it includes the impact of terminations not only in third quarter but second quarter or whatever. So, the overall trend line wasn't that different. I think you may see a little bit more in the near-term just related to these that we have discussed at length. Overall outside of this book, we don't see where all of a sudden there's a much different churn in the business.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","I thought I would jump back in. I guess I may not be the only one that's surprised the stock is down almost 40% today and obviously it wasn't a good quarter. This seems like a lot. I know you have been asked this a little bit, Randy and Bill. Maybe a way to do this I think that it might be helpful as opposed to giving 2016 guidance which I know you're not giving, is maybe can we just go back and walk through historically how you viewed growth in EmCare.","I think historically, you probably would have said same store revenue 3% to 4%, new contracts 3% to 4%. So it is kind of a high single-digit organic and then with acquisitions into the double digit revenue range. Is that a fair characterization of how you really viewed the business coming into and before the ACA impact?","Randy Owen","Yes, Gary, it is. Again, what I think we're talking about to your point is more of a short-term difference in trend. But if you look at the components, I do think same store revenue comes back to that, 3%, 4% where volume's 2%, 3%, rate may be 1% or 2%. It is just, again, that's the longer-term trend. I think it does go back to that over time. As we said earlier, the new contract pipeline is still robust. ","We're still seeing demand for services. We still believe that obviously what we have been able to show from a metric improvement and the results that we have from a client perspective are still very compelling. There's still a lot of demand and obviously acquisitions we'll continue to look at strategically and selectively depending on those that really have an impact and our ability to enhance our organic growth or in certain markets where we're focused on market centricity and trying to really enhance those market's ability.","Bill Sanger","I'll repeat what I've said several times this morning. Clearly it was a disappointing quarter. Systematically, the Company is intact, we're doing very well, $4 billion of revenue and $435 million of EBITDA. This quarter was an anomaly. We did not execute against a series of contracts so we did not respond quick enough.","We know the causes, we have taken action to get those causes back on track. We understand that in a public company, you never disappoint and we've taken the actions that are necessary. In addition to the fact that the top line in the overall outlook continues to be very good for this Company, we haven't paid much attention to what's really going to be a growth engine of the future and that is what's happening with Evolution Health. We're talking about very large contracts with great profitability opportunity that are going be complementing our relationships that we have throughout the organization with EmCare and AMR.","As we look to the future, not only do we feel consistently bright about being able to get things back on track at EmCare and the growth rate will continue as we see in past, but we now have another growth leg, if you will, that is going to contribute substantially to the Company future. Again, thank you for asking the question.","Bill Sanger","Operator, at this point in time, I would like to go ahead and end the conference call. Again, we want to thank you for your support and your questions for this morning.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"8902":["Envision Healthcare Holdings (NYSE:EVHC) Q2 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call July 30, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Craig Wilson - Secretary, SVP and General Counsel","William Sanger - Chairman, President and CEO","Randel Owen - CFO and COO","Ted Van Horne \u2013 CEO, American Medical Response","Analysts","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Josh Raskin - Barclays","Whit Mayo - Robert Baird","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","AJ Rice - UBS","Operator","Welcome to the Envision Healthcare Holdings Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I will turn the meeting over to Craig Wilson, General Counsel. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Wilson","Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2015. Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO, and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors section of our most recent filed annual report on form 10-K, and our quarterly report on form 10-Q to be filed next week.","The forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon, along with our remarks today, are made as of today, July 30, 2015, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued this afternoon, which is also available in the investor relations section of our website at www.evhc.net. All comparisons included in our presentation today are for the second quarter and first six months of 2015, to the same periods in 2014, unless otherwise noted.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","William Sanger","Thank you, Craig. And good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot of exciting news to discuss today on our call. But before starting my remarks, I would like to introduce and will be available for the Q&A section of the call today. Ted Van Horne, who is the CEO of American Medical Response.","Our results for the second quarter of 2015 were excellent, with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter up by more than 20% from the prior year period. Overall, we're very pleased with the execution across all the operating segments.","Randy will provide a detailed discussion of the quarter in a few minutes. But at a high level view, our second quarter results include revenue growth of 26% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 21%. Adjusted EPS was 32% and cash flow from operations for the quarter was $160 million.","Our growth continues to be quite balanced, coming from the combination of net new contracts, same-store growth and new service offerings and strategic acquisitions. In fact, this afternoon, we announced the agreement to acquire radical transportation company Rural\/Metro, in a strategic transaction that will positively impact our growth strategy.","Rural\/Metro is a leading medical transportation company, with a diverse and complementary geographic footprint, with 1.2 million annual patient transports, including the over 100 911 contracts.","Rural\/Metro has achieved meaningful operational improvements over the last few years. And they're expected to generate approximately $600 million in revenue in 2015, with EBITDA margins in the 10% range before any synergies. This transaction was accretive to adjusted EPS upon closing, which we expect to be by the latter part of this year.","We also believe we'll achieve approximately $25 million to $28 million in annualized synergies when fully implemented by 2017. We're confident that there will be many opportunities for us to apply some of the same processes and technologies at Rural that we broke out at AMR over the past several years.","As many of you are aware, these initiatives have led to significant operating efficiencies at AMR. From a financial standpoint, this is a very attractive transaction. However, we are not doing this simply for the financial impact alone.","Rural\/Metro will expand our geographic footprint and scale of medical transportation services, which in turn will enhance our ability to more effectively manage patients across the care continuum.","As a matter of context, the healthcare system is moving towards caring for patients in the right side of care based on their acuity. As an industry leader, we are investing in technologies and processes, as well as advancing care programs, that create incentives for providers to more effectively coordinate the care.","Today, Envision provides many of these coordinated touch points across the pre-hospital, hospital and post-hospital environments. Frankly, I am hard pressed to think of a healthcare organization with the breath of services that we deliver to improve patient outcomes and lower costs.","So how will AMR, combined with Rural\/Metro, fit into this continuum. During the past several years, we've expanded the role of the paramedic and the EMT. Historically they have provided pre-hospital stabilization and transport to healthcare facilities. That will still be an important part of what they do today, and also tomorrow, but that's also a very limited view of their skill set.","These skilled clinicians are now being deployed to support the care models we have introduced in advance at Envision Healthcare. Today, in several key markets, specially trained AMR paramedics conduct the vital medical assessments when patients are discharged from hospitals to lower QE settings, including their home.","This had had a direct impact our ability to better coordinate care for patients, reduce readmission rates and lower provider costs. In this environment, the role of the paramedic and the EMT becomes invaluable as boots on the ground, working in coordination with post-acute and acute care providers like our hospitalists.","While I've focused my comment so far on this exciting announcement, and EmCare and Evolution Health Services are seeing some of their expansion. Over the past several years, we've made great strides integrating care across various touch points, focusing on both the patient and increasingly on population management.","This approach has successfully positioned the company for the bundled payment for care initiative commonly known as BPCI or bundles. On July 1 of this year, we went live with our first 18 bundles sites. These include a combination of both model two and model three in seven states, with a variety of bundles at each site.","To assure we are successful and improve patient experiences and clinical outcomes, we have implemented our integrated care model for these patients. Under this model, we deliver evidence based care, working with AMR, EmCare and Evolution Health.","As an example, our nurse\u2019s work with our hospitalists and AMR medics to transition patients to the next site of care, where in medication reviews and clinical providers follow up patients into the home, and also in the post-acute care facilities.","This care is further supported by 24\/7 telephonic support, care coordination and unplanned care services from our state-of-the-art medical command center. This coordinated approach is already getting market recognition and traction.","Although after just four weeks, it's too early to report the specific outcomes, our hospital partners are already benefiting from our national leadership role in care redesign, and we're seeing downstream benefits.","For example, Evolution Health recently entered into agreement to provide telemarketing services for a large health system's BPCI patients. This will begin in August at eight hospitals in four states and expand from there. We are also contracting with other episode initiator to manage their post-acute care services.","In October, Envision will have sites into the program, which will bring the estimated size of our program to approximately $250 million. As a reminder, the universe of Medicare revenue under our management is approximately $1 billion. We have been very thoughtful and strategic in our program participation to assure clinical integrity and delivering high quality.","Speaking of Evolution Health, we continue our business expansion with health plans, health systems and at risk entities. In June, we expanded our operations in Las Vegas, adding a new behavioral health service line, providing a platform for growth in clinical integration with our transitional care programs.","We're also in the final stages of negotiations with several health plans that serve the Medicare Advantage patient in four separate states. The benefits are also evident in our end care division. The integration of the acquisition EMA and SEA has expanded our reach into new hospitals and physician relationships.","These relationships have expanded our business development acquisition pipelines, to where today, they are the highest in history. The combination of our new sales and M&A pipelines in our contracting strategies give us the ability to enter into our targeted markets in a much more meaningful way today.","Now before I turn the call over to Randy Owen, our Chief Financial Officer, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our 35,000 clinicians and support staff. It's their efforts in making a difference on board [ph] we serve that really have been the success of our corporation. Randy?","Randel Owen","Thank you Bill, and good afternoon everyone. As we highlighted in our press release, this was a strong quarter for Envision Healthcare from both the top line and adjusted EBITDA growth.","Envision generated revenue of $1.35 billion in the quarter, which was up 25.9%, driven by both acquisition and organic growth. As we stated, acquisitions will continue to be a larger component of our growth this year due to transactions completed during the first half of the year, and the pending Rural\/Metro transaction.","We're pleased with the rate of new contract wins in our sales pipeline, which also continues to drive organic growth.","Adjusted EBITDA was $162.8 million and grew by 20.5% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12%, compared to 12.6% in Q2 of last year. Operating income grew by 22.7% to $114.3 million, and we reported net income of $52.4 million, which compares with the loss of $2 million in Q2 of last year.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.37, which was up 32%. GAAP EPS was $0.27, and compared to a $0.01 per share loss for Q2 of last year.","Our EmCare segment reported revenue of $929.1 million, which was up 34.6%. Acquisition growth was 20.1%, which includes the first complete quarter with results from the transactions we completed in February and early March. While it's early in the process, we're pleased with the results from EMA, SEA and Vista, which are all performing well, and integration efforts are on track.","EmCare's organic revenue growth was 14.5%, and comprised of net new contract adds of 9.1% and same-store growth of 5.4%. On a same-store contract base, revenue grew 6%. Volume was up 4.4% for the quarter and is positive for all service lines, including a 4% growth at our emergency departments and 6% for our hospital services.","Yield is up 1.6%, including an ED increase of 2.1%, despite the impact of a reduction in parity revenue of $7.3 million in the quarter, compared to Q2 of last year. Our yield also included the impact of lower anesthesia collection rates, due to previously discussed billing issues at selected contracts. The anesthesia billing transitions are in process, and will be completed before the end of the year.","The 9.1% growth in net new contracts at EmCare includes 3.3 percentage points at Evolution Health, which is principally the result of the rollout of the Ascension Health joint venture markets. EmCare contract starts in the quarter were consistent with contract starts in Q2 of '14 and with contract starts in the first quarter of this year.","Of contracts started in the quarter, 55% were with existing customers, as we continue to see acceleration of multiple services with existing customer relationships. Contract starts in the quarter were offset by a higher number of contract terms as we were more aggressive in terminating certain underperforming contracts.","EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was $105.2 million, an increase of 19.1%. Margin of 11.2% was 150 basis points lower than the prior year, due to a 60 basis point reduction from the net impact of lost Medicaid parity revenue, a 50 basis point reduction related to lower collection rates on certain anesthesia contracts, and 40 basis points from the impact of contracts that have now been terminated.","Evolution Health contributed $57.3 million net revenue in the quarter, as part of EmCare's net revenue growth for 114.3% increase over Q2 of '14, and contributed $6.8 million to EmCare's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, compared to $2.2 million in Q2 of 2014.","This increase was primarily driven by the addition of new business from the Ascension joint venture and from strong volumes in the quarter. The integration of the initial Ascension markets has gone very well, with better-than-expected margins.","We're anticipating adding new markets in 2015, which will have lower initial margins, including start up cost. So we anticipate that margins for the full year will be lower than Q2, due to these additional new business starts.","The results at AMR continue to reflect strong operating performance, revenue of $425.2 million increased by 10.3% overall, and includes same market revenue growth of 7.1%, net new contract growth of 3% and the remainder from acquisitions.","AMR same market volume grew by 5.9%, while yield increased by 1.2%. Same market volume growth was driven by an increase in non-emergency transports, as we've been successful in increasing volumes at relationships in existing markets.","Net new contract growth was driven primarily by an increase in new inter facility contracts with health systems and growth in our managed transportation business. As noted in our release, we also recently closed the transaction in the Northeast, with net revenues of approximately $25 million in comparable AMR margins.","Adjusted EBITDA grew by 22.9% at AMR to $57.6 million and margin expanded by 140 basis points, to 13 1\/2%. Margin expansion was driven by strong same market volume growth, ongoing benefits from our deployment efficiency programs, growth of our managed transportation business, and other cost reduction initiatives. Fuel costs were about $1.5 million lower in the quarter, compared to second quarter last year.","As noted in our release, we expect to close the Rural\/Metro transaction during the fourth quarter of 2015. We anticipate Rural\/Metro adjusted EBITDA margins, before any synergies, to be approximately 10%.","And we anticipate synergies of approximately $25 million to $28 million to be in place by 2017 and to be accretive to AMR overall margins upon full implementation of expected synergies. We plan to provide additional information on the transaction in the near future.","Our cash flows for the quarter were strong and continue to improve on a year-over-year basis. We had $115.6 million in cash flow from operations, up from $63.7 million in Q2 of 2015. Adjusted free cash flow was $108 million, up from $43.5 million. Cash flows improved due to higher net income, as well as our accounts receivable management efforts.","DSO improved at both EmCare and AMR on a sequential basis. EmCare's DSO improved by four days, while AMR improved by one day, resulting in a three day improvement on a consolidated basis. Year-to-date, Envision generated cash flow from operations of $160.9 million, which is up 71.3%. Adjusted free cash flow of $145.1 million is up 72.1%.","At June 30, we had total debt outstanding of about $2.2 billion, with a net debt ratio of 3.4 times. When including the post synergy impact, EBITDA impact and related financing on the Rural\/Metro transaction, we anticipate our leverage will continue to be below four times, giving us continued flexibility to grow all aspects of our business.","We are not adjusting our 2015 annual guidance at this time. Results to date are in line with our guidance range and we don't anticipate modifying guidance until we have more details on when the Rural\/Metro acquisition will close.","We do anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 26% to 26.5% of our annual EBITDA guidance. We anticipate a higher growth rate in Q4, based on the timing of new business starts and expected margin improvement at EmCare.","Operator, at this point, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit about the Rural\/Metro deal. Sometimes, companies talk about synergies a little bit differently. And I just want to understand exactly are you thinking about it.","Sometimes, companies talk about getting the acquired up to their target margins, and then the synergy is being kind of corporate double on top that. Is that how you're thinking about the 25 and 20, if those are your mostly corporate G&A synergies or is it 25 to 28 kind of bringing them up to where you are, including any G&A savings?","William Sanger","Kevin, this is Bill. And then I'm going to ask and Ted Van Horne to also comment. As we look at the synergies, there obviously are some traditional back office synergies that most acquisitions, you see the benefits.","But we also have substantial regional opportunities for consolidation, particularly as it relates to call centers. And so it\u2019s going to be really a combination, and it will essentially allow us to be much more profitable within the particular regions where we consolidate the two operations. Ted, would you like to add any comments to that?","Ted Van Horne","Sure, Bill, thanks. And it's been a large investment that AMR and Envision has been making over the last few years in the technology aspects. We've been standardizing and one reason why, for a good portion of margin improvement has been standardization of everything from payroll functions to our dispatch processing centers, and how we actually manage our deployment modeling with our \u2013 with technology we have in the ambulances.","So a lot of that items that we use right now will be able to expand into the Rural\/Metro business model and allows for a lot of the efficiencies and actually improve service and do a lot of exciting things with the delivery model in healthcare for transportation.","William Sanger","Thanks, Ted.","Kevin Fischbeck","Maybe a follow on to that, then. It sounds like a lot of what - you talk a lot about kind of the Evolution Health type dynamic of this deal. How important was that to the transaction.","And I guess, maybe if we're thinking around how important is having an ambulance and EMT presence to winning a new contract on the Evolution Health side?","William Sanger","It was certainly a factor as we looked at the benefits, strategically of combining these two companies. More and more, we're seeing an integration between all three aspects of the Company, Kevin. And transportation is becoming an important element, not just for the patient but also for health plans, particularly for hospitals where they discharge patients.","And the transition of bringing that paramedic to the hospital, having moved that patient into the alternative site, and taking the opportunity to evaluate that environment has been very effective for us in terms of identifying what are the key factors that Evolution has to concentrate on, as well as lowering the provider cost versus sending out a much more expensive provider to do those types of assessments.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess, it sounds like it\u2019s just\u2026","William Sanger","Say again. Hello?","Kevin Fischbeck","Can you hear me? Hello?","William Sanger","Yes, now we have you back. Kevin, are you back?","Kevin Fischbeck","Yes, I hope you hear me?","William Sanger","Yes, we can.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Sorry. So I guess what I just think about the Evolution business plan, there's a combination of leveraging kind of your home health and medical metric capabilities, along with EMT platform.","I guess, how often do you get into an Evolution contract where you don't have that EMT platform? Is that, or has that, in any way been a gating factor to winning new contracts?","William Sanger","I do think it's an important element of our service delivery. I don't believe it is a critical factor in getting the contract. I would say it's a, added to the factor that where we explain this to health plans and to health systems. They get the a-ha moment and they see the value of integrating transportation, and the use of the community paramedics, as we've affectionately refer to these particular paramedics.","It's becoming more and more integrated with the delivery of care, and I think over time, we're going to see those walls, if you will, begin to dissolve between these three organizations.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, maybe if I could, just a little more on the Rural\/Metro announcement. Just to understand, I think when you've talked about that competitor in the recent past, you've emphasized the opportunity to win contracts from them organically.","What sort of tipped you - your balance in wanting to acquire them versus continuing to take market share without having to purchase an asset? And can you talk at all about what kind of multiple you paid for this?","William Sanger","Well, Matthew, we did announce that we paid $620 million for the offset and that the margins were about 10%. So I guess you could maybe do the math?","Matthew Borsch","Yes.","William Sanger","Pre-synergy, it fits around that. Obviously, after synergy it's a much lower multiple. And as it relates to - look, I don't want to get into discussions of competition for obvious reasons. That fact notwithstanding.","They have guide, when I say they, I meet Rural\/Metro, does a very good job of holding the strong level in contract. We have been effective on some larger system contracts. We do think this provides us with an opportunity far beyond just simply competing for contracts.","But also provides us additional geographic footprints in further scope of services that enhance both the Envision and, frankly, also the EmCare core business.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. And do I understand it right that you \u2013 that you expect the transaction to be accretive by 2017 or is that when you hit the maximum synergy rate?","I mean, is it accretive from the start or is it neutral to this year? And when does it become accretive?","William Sanger","Matt, we do anticipate it to be accretive from day one. Obviously, we'll - depending on the timing of close we'll start the process of taking the synergies and making the changes collectively in the organizations.","And so that will take some time, and so 2016, you're probably not going to get a full year of synergy. It's probably 2017 when you get the fully realized impact. It would be accretive from the start.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And we have one another question, and its coming from Mr. Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich","Thanks for taking the questions, good afternoon. Just following up on a little bit more on the Rural\/Metro. Randy, I was wondering if you could maybe provide some of the details in terms of the growth metrics and other metrics you provide for AMR?","And also, how much geographic overlap, are you guys expecting any divestitures with this transaction?","William Sanger","Yes, Kevin. Look, I don't - we were going to provide, we'll provide additional information around sort of growth metrics. That's something that's obviously closed here recently.","So we will be putting some of that together and getting that out to the public here, in the near future. Also, there is a lot of geographic diversity, but we really can't sort of comment on that, at this point.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. And then just to be clear, the $25 million of $28 million of synergy, I'm still not sure if I understand. How much of that is bringing Rural\/Metro up to the - your corporate margins and how much of it is \u2013 of that is back office efficiencies and reductions?","Randel Owen","Kevin, most of that is really around being able to one, obviously, have corporate synergies, billing synergies, primarily every quarter, maybe back-office synergies, if you want to call it that, is really what that's driven off of.","I think longer-term, we clearly and we believe there is some additional opportunity over time, as we implement other technologies and whatever to improve those margins, as well. But this is really taken off of sort of a base of where they are and looking at synergies around more of your traditional type of synergies in a transaction.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then one quick one on BPCI. Wondering what your initial thoughts are, since it went live. Bill, you gave some good detail in seven states for your model 2 and 3.","I guess, what's your expectation for 2016, when you'll get some information from Medicare?","William Sanger","We're going to be cautious here, Kevin. What I can share with you is that we just have not participated in hoping for the best, as many have done and have been selective on the early selection.","But we've taken a step further and we've wrapped around a clinical model that ensures that we are going to be effective and profitable with these episodes that we've identified.","So I'm going to reserve probably until the latter part of '15 or early '16, before we comment on what we believe the benefit in value will be to our bottom line.","Kevin Ellich","Okay, great. Thank you.","William Sanger","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Josh Raskin from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. I'll just stick with BPCI real quick. Bill, can you just remind us or Randy, the financial impact, are there costs that are associated with this that are running through the P&L, and maybe where are those? And in terms of size and segment, I'm assuming EmCare. And then, when would you expect to have some revenue booked for that program?","William Sanger","Josh, they are barely costs associated with intervening with these patients, if you will. And I'll reiterate what I just shared when Kevin asked the question, we are more than just accepting these episodes and continuing to deliver care, as we have in the past.","What we are doing is, we are looking at, particularly in the post-acute care side, what services can better ensure that that 90 day episode is an effective one.","Now at the same time, we are expending resources, but we also are able to charge on a fee for service basis, those services that we do provide. So net-net, we're not spending a lot of money at this point in time, nor do we seek big investments in order to manage the program.","Josh Raskin","Okay, that's helpful. And then just back to Rural\/Metro, I guess just from a timing perspective. They've obviously gone through a lot the last couple of years. It sounds like things are more stable. But could you give us a comparison, that $6 million of revenue, what does that compare to for 2014?","And then in that context, you're paying just over 10 times, I understand it is just over 7 times fully synergized. But from a multiple perspective that feels relatively high for an asset that's struggled. So maybe help us where they are in the sort of turnaround and in terms of growth, et cetera, expectations?","Randel Owen","This is Randy. Look, a couple things I could tell you is, if you look at '14, the revenue was a little below what we think of '15. So just in that period, there's not a significant change in the revenue stream.","I think they've really been looking at, obviously a lot of internal initiatives. I think they've done a really nice job of obviously, making a number of changes in right sizing the business, over the last several years, both from a contracting standpoint, from an infrastructure standpoint. So as we got into this, we were impressed with what they've been able to achieve.","So I think, again, I think if you look at it Josh, from our perspective it's a much different sort of business than it was a number of years ago. as they've gone through some of the struggles they have.","And while, again, on the surface, it may look like a higher multiple on the gross basis, obviously, when you look at that from a net basis, as well as being able to collectively grow our business and even expand some of the margins over the longer term.","Josh Raskin","Okay. So it sounds like revenues are relatively flat this year, but margins are up. And so you'd argue this is an EBITDA-growing business right now?","Randel Owen","That's very true. That's very accurate.","Josh Raskin","And then just one last question on Rural, when we think about capital expenditures in the future, I'm trying to get to, is this going to be a synergistic in the sense that you've got savings around some of the actual hard assets, or are there upgrades needed, and investments in new vehicles, et cetera? I'm just trying to think, is the CapEx together going to be higher or sort of lower than the sum of the parts?","Randel Owen","Josh, it's a little of both. So if you look in the short term, I think we anticipate making some additional investments in their fleet for example and in other areas. So probably in the next year or two, you will see some additional CapEx we've anticipated, as a part of that transaction.","I think longer-term, clearly with the larger scale, we do believe there's opportunities for efficiencies, not only from the operating expense but from a capital yield perspective.","Josh Raskin","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Sir, your line is now open.","Whit Mayo","Operator","Hello?","Randel Owen","Operator? We are not - yes, Whit?","Whit Mayo","I am here, can you hear me?","Randel Owen","Yes. Now we can, now we can.","Whit Mayo","All right. Sorry about that. Looking at your EmCare new contract growth, it's averaged right around $65 million a quarter for, call it over 2 years now. Some a little higher, some a little lower.","But any reason that that trend goes up or down, when you look at your pipeline, and it has just been very steady, and just wondering if there is something, some limitation that keeps that from getting larger, going forward?","Randel Owen","No, I think what as Bill \u2013 I think as we both mentioned, Whit, the pipeline is still robust. We're still seeing demand and even more demand for multiple services. That percentage, the cross-selling percentage continues to increase. The number as I mentioned, this quarter was a little lower on the surface, just because we had - we chose to exit more contracts and we were a little more aggressive on that.","So when you look at the actual starts, it's very consistent and still very strong. And the net number was a little lower, just because of the terms. So no, we're still seeing a lot of demand for the different services.","Whit Mayo","Okay. And Randy, can you just talk more about the expected fourth quarter business starts that you referenced in your prepared remarks. Just $25 million to $35 million just seems like pretty a big sequential swing in your guidance from the third quarter, stepping up to the fourth quarter.","And I guess I think of the fourth quarter being a weaker ER quarter. I know it's not always the case. But just trying to get some more comfort into how you progress from the third quarter to the fourth quarter?","Randel Owen","Yes, no, I think a couple things. One is, look, if you look at expected starts, and we've got - we really do have good visibility, usually for 120 to 180 days, in terms of those starts. So we do expect a ramp up in starts this quarter, as well as fourth quarter.","We also expect to see margin improvement from recent starts. As we've talked about before, they typically start lower margin and then we re able to improve that margin in a relatively short period of time in many cases.","We also anticipate a lowering impact of the anesthesia issue that we talked in the first quarter. It was lower this quarter, but we think we will get past that before we get to the fourth quarter.","So there are a number of pieces. The Vista acquisition we're well underway with using that to assist us with staffing in both new starts or where we have openings. So there are number of initiatives that Todd and his team have taken underway and we're seeing that sort of build, as you look at the rest of the year.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Randel Owen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Sir, your line is now open.","Ryan Daniels","Yes, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Bill, maybe a big picture one for you, you mentioned you are seeing a lot more opportunity in Medicare Advantage plans with payers. So I'm curious, one, if you could talk about how that revenue model is honing out?","And the number two, I'm curious if you are seeing similar activity in providers, as a lot of these larger health systems attempt to launch their own plans?","William Sanger","Yes, Ryan. As we look at our relationship with the health plans it is emerging. Our revenue model is really aimed at identifying the services which we believe we can positively influence both utilization and better outcomes.","And what we have done is we've identified what services we offer and then we will identify within the context of their PMPM, what effect that may have. And we segregate, let's take, for example, a health plan is receiving $1,000 PMPM. We can actuarially identify the services that we offer in acute and post-acute care side.","We will segregate those and actually have a bundle payment arrangement, where we may get $200 a month to manage a scope of services that could include transportation, could include monitoring, could include unplanned care. What we typically do, we'll look at where the gaps exist in the delivery in the medical loss ratio for a health plan, and focus on that.","We think it's a very unique approach that, frankly, most every health plan that we're in discussions with, they like the model. We obviously have stop-loss arrangements. So our risk is substantially mitigated, but also an opportunity to reap the benefits of our delivery beyond just fee for service.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. That's very helpful color. And then a separate topic, just on the acquisition front. Does the Rural\/Metro deal slow down your appetite for other acquisitions, I guess particularly in the EmCare division or is that full steam ahead?","William Sanger","Well, it actually has increased our appetite.","Ryan Daniels","And is that because of new market centric strategies that you could go into with the combined assets or why is it kind of\u2026","William Sanger","Well, look, the reality is, this is a very positive opportunity for us. It's opens new markets. And many of these markets are right in our market centric strategy. We are and have been, in discussions with many groups out there. We've said this many times, and we will continue to socialize those relationships in the right markets.","But because we've done this large tuck-in, it does not in any way hamper our interest or our ability to execute on other arrangements of similar size.","Ryan Daniels","Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Tanquilut","Good afternoon. Randy or Bill, just a first question on the Rural\/Metro acquisition. What are the regulatory hurdles or issues that we need to think about, as it relates to change of control in the contract, COMs, and then their relationships with their unions?","William Sanger","Well, I'll give you a 30,000 foot view of that and then I'm going to ask Ted to talk a little bit about the state and the contractual regulation and criteria that we have to jump through.","Obviously, we filed [indiscernible] and we'll go through the process, answer any questions that they may have. We're confident that we'll get through that favorably. As it relates to the local relationships and state, Ted, would you please comment on that?","Ted Van Horne","Share. And AMS is generally very local. So we have to go through a process with many of the states, where a state regulated environment filing that we're transferring certificates and licenses.","And then in many cases, where you have 911 contracts, we actually work with those administrations on timing, and also all the notifications that we need on transfer of equipment and a lot of times, registration of vehicles and those types of pieces.","So it's something we do normally, in the course of business, as we've done other acquisitions. And with the tuck-in, as Bill said, we broke it up in regions and then we individually work with each of the states and customers.","Brian Tanquilut","And then to that - follow-up to that. A lot of the contracts that you had identified in the past as opportunities, whether it's San Diego or other markets, a lot of those were Rural\/Metro contracts.","So once this deal closes, should we think of the new contract win opportunity as a smaller pie, going forward?","William Sanger","We don't feel that at all. San Diego, for example was just renewed for Rural\/Metro for quite a number of more years. And across the US there's a lot of other ambulance areas, and that really are service by regional providers or smaller companies.","So there's still quite a bit out there. Just recently, we were awarded some 911 systems in Texas that were new markets for AMR, also. So it's a large market and we're real excited about it.","Brian Tanquilut","And one follow-up, if I may, just for Randy or Bill. A follow-up to Whit's question on organic growth in EmCare.","So is it still safe to think that you can drive double-digit, put it low-double-digit to mid-teens organic growth in EmCare over the next three years?","Randel Owen","No. This is Randy. Look, given what we see now, we think we can. Obviously, same-store growth will always vary somewhat a little bit. But it tends to be in a general sort of 3% to 5% range and the pipeline is still robust.","So we still believe that our net new sales opportunities can still be in that sort of high single-digit, low, double-digit kind of range. So that\u2019s on a combined basis, you're still in that - close to that mid-teens range.","Brian Tanquilut","Got it. All right. Thanks guys. Congratulations again.","Randel Owen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Next question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew Schenker","Thanks. So first, back to Rural\/Metro here. We talked about, obviously, the cost savings synergies. Is there actually an opportunity here for some revenue synergies, as well from it either including them into some of your existing inter-facility contracts or related to that, expanding some of those?","William Sanger","I can't really address that at this point in time. We do know that we're pretty confident, one plus one on the revenues side will be more than two. And we're pretty confident on the expense side, one plus one is going to be less than two.","So Ted, would you like to add to that? We don't see substantial increased revenue from the synergies. We do think that the growth projectile will not slow down.","Ted Van Horne","That's correct, Bill. I mean, we've got markets where there were neighbors and there's opportunities for us to work with customers or health systems, which has been a very big strategy for AMR the last three years.","And the new space, the new areas that Rural\/Metro has allows us to help those health systems and payers out in a larger area. So we're excited about that, and we don't think it is going to go the other direction.","Andrew Schenker","Okay. Great. And then just real quick, on - could you updated us on mix shift, related to reform in the quarter?","Randel Owen","Andrew, this is Randy. There's really no major change in mix. We saw a little bit of a mix shift really driven on the EmCare side, really just from the sort of recent kind of acquisitions. But from a core business standpoint, it was pretty stable.","Andrew Schenker","Okay. And one real quick here, on seasonality, I know we talked about the ramp into the fourth quarter. But even just looking at the third quarter, it looks a little light as a percentage of total earnings, versus last couple of years there.","Is there anything in particular weighing on that quarter or is it really just about this outsized growth into the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Randel Owen","Yes, I think it's really more of a timing difference. Look, I think we've also - we've not assumed, at this point, that you're going to maintain those same growth levels. Volumes have obviously been strong in the first half of the year. And you don't know exactly what they will be. And so we've tried to be a little conservative around just sort of core volumes, but it's really more timing around new business.","Andrew Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from AJ Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.","AJ Rice","Yes, thanks. Hello everybody, congratulations on the Rural deal. That's a great win for you there. On the organic pricing number that you gave, I think 1.6%. When you consider that against the fact you lost Medicaid parity, the fact that you've got still, some lingering effects from this issue with the collections and the one anesthesiology group, it's impressive that you're up 1.6%. What are the offsets that are driving that price increase?","Randel Owen","Well, AJ, it's Randy. It's really two things. I mean, it really is just that kind of parity component, which was a little over $7 million of revenue, about $5.5 million on the EBITDA basis. So that obviously is the main thing.","And then the anesthesia side was negative yield, just because we decided to lower the revenue, just given what we've talked about before. But if you look at, really, most of the other services, you know rates were slightly positive. And to your point, ED rate would've been even higher, if it hadn't been for that parity change. But it really is those two things. Their [ph] reimbursements fairly stable, you are able to go through traditional sort of increases in different areas. But those are the main things.","AJ Rice","Okay. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned exiting some underperforming contracts. I wondered if I could go back and get you to elaborate on what exactly we're talking about there, and the order of magnitude of that?","Randel Owen","Yes, if you look at that, AJ, again, we always have look from time to time, you always have contracts, like we've talked before, that for some reason or other, may turn negative or have challenges.","Whether it's recruiting, or something happens in the community, it's under stress. And so we obviously try to right-size those, and when we don't, then we are able to exit those contracts. And in this case, we just had a number of contracts that we decided we were not going to right-size and we terminated them. And so it just happened to be, from the timing, a larger group this quarter.","If you look at, from a percentage standpoint, we really had contracts starts that were closer to 13% in the quarter, terms were around 7%. So if you take out the Evolution, and you look at the net 6%, the contract starts are still very strong. It's just the net number was a little lower because of the higher termination.","William Sanger","AJ, I feel very disciplined, when we see a contract that's outperforming at the expected levels. The first thing we're going to do is, we have to have a lead process to find out exactly why it's not performing.","If it's an issue of finances, we'll look for a subsidy. If it's an issue of recruitment, we'll change our strategy. But if those two don't work, then essentially, we will exit the contract. And it's a discipline that we think is the right approach you take for our business.","AJ Rice","Okay, no, that makes sense. And then just finally, maybe any update on your JVs? Obviously, you have had a lot - a couple announced last year, with a lot of fanfare.","And just wondering if there's an update on that, and any progress from marketing other deals in the marketplace?","William Sanger","I think our partnership arrangements on JVs are performing at or above expectations. There's certainly a lot of interest in there, and we're confident that we will be able to talk about more of those relationships in the future, AJ.","AJ Rice","Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","William Sanger","Thank.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. At this time, we don't have any other questions in queue. I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Sanger.","William Sanger","Okay. Thank you very much. And everyone, thank you very much for your interest in the company and support.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Envision Healthcare Corporation Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting today through November 10, 2017. The number for the replay is 719-457-0820, and the code is 1316792.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Kneeley, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bob Kneeley","Thank you, Vicky, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our presenters today are Chris Holden, CEO and President; and Kevin Eastridge, CFO. In addition, Karey Witty, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Jackson, President of Envision Physician Services, will make some brief comments.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. We encourage you to carefully review the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K filed earlier this year in addition to the risks and uncertainties described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we expect to file in the coming days.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday afternoon, along with our remarks on this call, are made as of today, November 1, 2017, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued yesterday afternoon, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.evhc.net. We encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website regularly, which we use to communicate important information regarding Envision Healthcare to investors.","I'll turn the call over to our CEO and President, Chris Holden. Chris?","Christopher Holden","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We have a full agenda on items to discuss this morning. And we'd ask the operator to extend the call to allow more time for questions.","As you are aware in Q3, we experienced an unprecedented combination of natural and other disasters. I am pleased to report that our clinical colleagues exceeded all our expectations in handling those emergencies and inspired us all with their stellar response.","The key takeaways for the quarter, number one, the guidance for Q4 requires additional discussion to better frame the outlook on the earnings power of the company, and we're going to dedicate much of this call to that matter. And per our press release, our Board of Directors has decided to undertake a review of strategic, financial and operational alternatives. The purpose of this review is to be transparent, fair and thorough in our consideration of all alternatives with the goal of determining the best path for enhancing shareholder value.","We remain bullish on and confident in the strategic direction of the company. We continue to see positive momentum or synergies, new sales, managed care contracting and acquisitions. We believe we are well positioned to grow organically, increase share through new contract growth and continue to make strategic accretive acquisitions in what are very large fragmented addressable markets. And lastly, we point out that the impact of the natural disasters should be combined to 2017.","Turning now to the results for the third quarter, we estimate the impact of the storms on the third quarter was $22 million in revenue and $22 million in adjusted EBITDA. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we believe that the financial impact of the storms was isolated to Q3 and our operations in storm-affected markets have returned to normal. In addition to the storm, two factors adversely influenced our actual results for the third quarter versus expectations. They are volumes for emergency medicine and anesthesia rate, driven largely by the composition of exchange payors, particularly in Florida, which is our largest market for anesthesia. Our ASC segment was generally in line with expectations when adjusted for the storm impact.","Now, let's pivot our discussion to the outlook for Q4. The outlook for the fourth quarter for 2017, in our mind does not fully incorporate a number of elements that will be part of our results going forward in 2018. And as a result, it's understandable that there is an optical issue with our run-rate, which we will explain this morning. The important elements of the run-rate calculation include the following.","Number one, we had very strong performance in new sales all year and in particular the third quarter, where we on-boarded more than 65 new contracts. This large bolus of new contracts is certainly a positive for the company and it supports the thesis that our unique suite of solutions is resonating with our health system clients. And while we are pleased with this growth, our start-up costs are incrementally higher than anticipated for the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2017.","However, these incremental costs will go away as we achieve optimal staffing on those new contracts.","Number two, the implied run-rate of our 2017 fourth quarter does not include the benefit in our revenue yield as we complete payor negotiations to migrate some out-of-network revenue to in-network status. And third, our 2017 fourth quarter does not include any benefits from meaningful operational improvements we expect to realize during 2018. In fairness, we have not reacted as quickly as we should have to adjust our cost structure in the face of more modest organic growth estimates.","Karey Witty, our new COO will provide additional detail on our operational improvement initiatives in his comments. In order to understand the fundamental earnings power of our organization, it is reasonable to include the impact of the items that I mentioned. We believe that as we complete 2017, the baseline adjusted EBITDA of our business is closer to $900 million.","At this time we are not providing guidance for 2018, however, we will be providing a revised view on the fundamental revenue drivers of the various business lines as follows. Same contract for Physician Services growth should be in the range of 2% to 3%, which reflects our moderated view on utilization.","Same contract for Ambulatory Services is 1% to 3%. Physician Services new contract growth is 2% to 3% and represents an expected significant improvement in 2018 over 2017. When you add these pieces together, we believe the organic growth profile of our business is in the 3% to 6% range. In addition, we continue to invest our free cash flow to accretive acquisitions and an effective multiple of approximately 7x to 8x. We think that M&A will add an additional 4% to 5% to our growth profile.","I believe we have the right leadership team in place to execute and grow against this profile. We have three new key executives, all in new positions; all three of these executives have hit the ground running in their new roles. Karey Witty was appointed our new COO one month ago. Karey has a unique depth of experience, having served as both CFO and CEO in both payor and provider organizations. His primary focus is on our operational improvement efforts.","Brian Jackson is our President of Envision Physician Services. Brian built his leadership skills as an Apache helicopter pilot with combat service in the Gulf War. And prior to joining Envision healthcare, Brian served as an executive at Cardinal Health and DaVita HealthCare Partners. Brian is customer focused and an advocate for physicians. He and Karey are already working closely together to drive operational excellence.","Kevin Eastridge was recently promoted to CFO and brings over 20 years of experience with the company as the Chief Accounting Officer. During his tenure, Kevin has been engaged with nearly every facet of the organization. And in so doing, he has developed an in-depth understanding of our core systems and processes, which will make him a great partner to Karey and Brian.","Shifting now to an update on AMR, and we'll hear from each of those leaders shortly. All parties are working diligently to complete the transaction during the fourth quarter. The FTC has requested more information and it's specifically relates to the competitive environment in one market, Hawaii. The buyer of AMR is working on a plan to divest those assets and remediate the issue.","We expect all of the net proceeds from that transaction approximately $1.9 billion will be used to reduce debt. We intent to deploy our free cash flow into attractive M&A opportunities and we continue to pursue our target leverage goal of 3 times to 4 times.","Shifting now to an update on out-of-network, we've made great strides in our move to in-network during the quarter. We measure that [Technical Difficulty] both our current in-network status and visibility to the 2018 progression. Just to remind you about the starting point, at December 31, 2016, we had about $1 billion in Envision Physician Services revenue from commercial payors that was out-of-network.","As of today, we've migrated 40% of that total from out-of-network to in-network status. During the quarter, we double the percentage from 20% to 40% of our overall goal. As expected the big move was a large chunk of revenue with the payor that executed a national agreement, and we expect to migrate an additional 35% of that $1 billion in revenue to in-network status during 2018. That will bring us to a level that is about 75% of conversion of the out-of-network to in-network.","Once that migration reaches the 75% mark, our total out-of-network exposure would be about 3% of the total for the company. We remain on track to bring this revenue in-network in a way that is mutual to our total revenue and margin. Earlier this year, we took a leadership position and identifying this as a solution to the out-of-network issue, and I'm proud of the progress we're making. This will be a distinct competitive advantage for organization and we'll continue to remove pain points for patient's health systems and payors.","With that, I'll end my comments here. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Karey Witty, our new Chief Operating Officer. Karey?","Karey Witty","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, all. In this new role as Chief Operating Officer, I'm focusing the organization on achieving operational excellence, while continuing to execute on our strategy and drive value for our shareholders. As work progresses through our annual budget process, we've already identified three key areas for operational improvement that will contribute to margin enhancement in 2018.","First is revenue cycle management. Our CM is core to our operation and with a successful merger integration, it is clear the best practices exist that will be deployed across the enterprise. Second, clinical network management, I understand this has been a KPI for Envision, since the merger.","We're pressured with premium labor coupled with a limited ability to flex staffing based on clinical demand. We must challenge these operating principals with our partners and find solutions that work for our parties. The opportunity here is to align all of the organization's resources, including our market leading staffing solutions to drive more effective staffing utilization.","And third, operational efficiencies. The organization will accomplish the identified cost synergies related to the merger. However, there are additional opportunities across the enterprise to streamline a number of activities and processes that will lead to an operating structure that drives results in any environment at a lower cost. I expect to develop work streams in each of these areas of operational excellence in the coming months, and we'll target a $50 million realized improvement in margin in 2018.","With that, I'd like to introduce Brian Jackson, our new President of Physician Services.","Brian Jackson","Thanks, Karey. I'm pleased to be with you all this morning. My new important role, my focus is on expanding the successes, we've achieved in our practice operations across all of the Physician Services segment. Specifically, we've developed the tools and processes to more effectively manage our anesthesia in women's and children's service lines, during my tenure as CEO at Sheridan. I'm confident that the processes we deployed there can be migrated to emergency medicine, hospitalist medicine, and across all of Physician Services.","Aligning with Karey's commentary, we'll work closely together in achieving these stated goals. In addition, we'll continue to drive clinical quality as a differentiator. I was able to spend some time with over 400 of our clinical leaders this weekend at our Physician Services leadership conference. I was inspired by their dedication to driving better outcomes for our patients and their inventiveness around new clinical integration pathways.","I'm also pleased to report that we received our approval as a patient safety organization. The PSO allows us to create patient improvement work products across state lines, move case review into a more protective space and to enhance patient safety improvement projects.","Lastly, we're focusing intently on creating a sustainable hospitals model. While, our merger thesis continues to prove its value with geographic opportunities to deepen our presence by offering a suite of services designed to address key pain points for our clients.","I'll turn it now back over to Chris.","Christopher Holden","Thank you, Brian. It's now my pleasure to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin. Eastridge, to review the financial results and guidance.","Kevin Eastridge","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join the call today, and welcome the opportunity to serve my new capacity. This is admittedly a time when our company and sector fact challenges in the market. During my tenure with the company, we have successfully navigated through many cycles. I'd like to say, I've worked with Claire Gulmi for many, many years, and she has been a great mentor to me. And I trust that the knowledge I've gained, while working with her will serve me well in my new capacity.","With that, I'll turn to the results. Our results for the third quarter of 2017 continue to be impacted by a lower healthcare utilization environment, particularly in relation to recent years. We also were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which we identified in our press release and Chris's comment. Envision's net revenue from continued operations was $1.99 billion for the third quarter of 2017. Both our Physician Services and Ambulatory Service operations were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which had a negative impact of $22 million on our revenue.","Adjusted EBITDA was $233.5 million that includes an estimated $22 million negative impact due to the storms. Adjusted EBITDA of $255.5 million, when excluding the estimated impact of the storms is below our most recent guidance. Essentially all of the variance to our guidance is attributable to Physician Services and more specifically lower-than-anticipated volumes for emergency medicines and lower-than-expected anesthesia rate.","I'll speak to these items in a minute. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 and net earnings from continued operations was $0.33 per share. Before providing specific discussion of our results, I want to remind you that our segment results are impacted by the reallocation of corporate expenses as a result of our decision earlier this year to move Medical Transportation to discontinued operations.","We've highlighted those amounts in our press release issued last night. For the second quarter, the impact of this reallocation was reduction of adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million for Physician Services and $2.1 million for Ambulatory Services, and an increase of $9.3 million for Medical Transportation.","I'll exclude this reallocation, as I present our segment results. In addition, my comments for Envision's income statement and balance sheet is for continued operations only. Our cash flow discussion is consolidated including both continuing and discontinued operations.","I'll discuss Physician Services results with the merger of the legacy AMSURG and Envision had occurred at the beginning of 2016, which makes it easier to compare results for the third quarter to the prior year period. Physician Services net revenue was $1.68 billion for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 7.6%. We estimate the storms reduced Physician Services revenue by $19 million during the quarter.","Revenue growth consisted of contributions from acquisitions of 9.6% and same-contract revenue growth of 0.4%, which was offset by 0.3% lower revenue from new contracts, and 2.1% decline in revenue from termination of a population health contract. Net revenue from new contracts decline by 0.3%, which is an improvement from the last several quarters and consistent with trajectory, we had expected throughout the year. As a reminder, for each of our quarters in 2017, revenue from contract terminations as exceeded new contract revenue growth. This is related to a number of contracts that have been terminated prior to the merger.","New contracts contributed revenue growth of 6.7%, while terminations were 7.0%. On a same-contract basis, revenue grew by 0.6%, which consists of rate growth 1.3% across all service lines, while volumes declined by 0.7%. Physician Services same-contract revenue was compressed by 1.1% due to the storm and most of the impact was related to anesthesia services, which has a concentration in Florida.","Moving on to same-contract metrics, please note that the following are not adjusted for the impact of the storm and reflect net positive payor settlement and adjustments of approximately $22 million across several service lines. The volume decline was largely attributable to emergency department volume decline of 1%.","Volumes of radiology and neonatal also declined. On the rate side, 1.3% overall growth for this segment was driven by emergency medicine, which continued to benefit, from our move to in-network status in several markets earlier this year. Anesthesia rate was positive, but without the settlements I just referred to, would have declined in the third quarter of 2016 as it had in the prior period.","This resulted from a continued shift in the composition of health insurance exchange patients from higher paying carriers to carriers that pay a lower rate per encounter, as well as lower acuity.","Adjusted EBITDA for Physician Services was $186.2 million when excluding the $7.2 million expense reallocation. In addition, the quarter benefited by approximately $10 million from reductions to various incentive plan accruals, which we had not forecasted. Physician Services' adjusted EBITDA was impacted by an estimated $20 million due to storm related disruptions.","The estimated adjusted EBITDA impact of the storms is $1 million higher than the revenue impact due to premium labor cost we incurred, largely attributable to payments made to clinical professionals who are providing continuous coverage during the storm as well as relief labor that we flew in to respond to medical needs in affected communities.","Evolution Health, which is part of our Physician Services, experienced lower rate and volume in its own health services during the quarter, resulting in a slight loss for that business. Physician Services' adjusted EBITDA margins was 11.1% when excluding the expense reallocation and 12.1% when adjusted for the impact of the storms.","As emphasized before, the lower than anticipated adjusted EBITDA for all of Envision in the third quarter relative to our outlook, was entirely within the Physician Services segment. And it shows the sensitivity of our business to volume fluctuation. Emergency medicine volume has declined by 0.3% through the nine months of 2017 when compared to prior-year period. And our outlook for Physician Services had anticipated positive same-contract volume growth for all Physician Services including emergency medicine.","For our Ambulatory Services segment, revenue was $309.4 million and there was an estimated $3 million revenue impact related to the storms. Third quarter revenue was impacted by $4.3 million, related to synergy consolidation that were included in the prior-year period.","Same-center revenue for Ambulatory Services increased by 0.8% on a day-adjusted basis and was entirely attributable to rate growth. Same-center procedure volume will then change. The storms effectively reduced Ambulatory Services same-center revenue growth by 1.2%. Adjusted EBITDA was $56.6 million, when excluding the expense reallocation for 18.3% margin. Excluding the estimated storm impact of $2 million, adjusted EBITDA margin for ambulatory surgery was essentially in line with our forecast. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding the storm impact was 18.8%.","AMR's revenue for the quarter of $692.2 million was positively impacted by its contract with FEMA to coordinate emergency medical service responses in storm-impacted areas, including Texas and Florida. Adjusted EBITDA was $75.3 million, when excluding the favorable corporate expense reallocation of $9.3 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet, at September 30, we had $319.3 million of cash, which includes $41.2 million of cash attributable to AMR. Total debt was $6.4 billion, while net debt was $6.1 billion. Our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement remains at 4.5 times. As Chris has stated, we expect to use proceeds from the divestiture of AMR to reduce debt.","Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $152.3 million, when excluding distributions to non-controlling interests and transaction costs, and cash flows continue to be strong, when considering the impact of the storms.","We estimate the disruptions at several of our operation centers as well as payor operations resulted in approximately $25 million impact to third quarter cash flow, which we expect to recoup in the fourth quarter.","Maintenance CapEx was $47.8 million in the quarter and that includes CapEx of $24 million for AMR. We spend $208.7 million on acquisitions during the quarter, which includes payments for acquisitions completed late in the second quarter of $126 million, we will - as we discussed on our previous earnings call. The nine months ended September 30, 2017, our acquisition spend is $694.4 million.","Finally, I'll make some comments about our guidance update for 2017. Our outlook for guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 is heavily influenced by our experience through the first nine months of the year. We've been challenged in forecasting emergency medicine volume all year. Anesthesia rate growth while buoyed by payor settlements over disputed claims has been declining for each of the last several quarters. The rate of new contract growth has been strong with startup costs putting pressure on current period adjusted EBITDA. So how are we adapting these factors? And what has changed?","In essence, the guidance we've updated in last night's press release removes from our forecast several elements that were in our previous guidance. These include, first, the anticipated volume lift in emergency medicine based on stock cost in the fourth quarter.","Our outlook for 2017 has always had volume growth in the fourth quarter, and we're now anticipating emergency volume that will be lower than the run rate in the third quarter, when adjusted for the lost volume due to the hurricanes. That follows more closely to the trajectory of last year's trend. Therefore, we're reducing our emergency volume growth expectation from 3% to flat. We also are reducing our emergency rates to amounts consistent with third quarter. These two factors account for approximately $28 million of adjusted EBITDA.","Second, our previous forecast had assumed a lift in anesthesia rate, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our revised outlook assumed that anesthesia rate will no longer - will no more than the level we experienced in the third quarter. It is our expectation that anesthesia rate will decline by approximately 2.5% to 3% from the prior year. This change accounts for approximately $22 million to $25 million.","Third, while the number of contracts signed year-to-date at 120 is impressive, we also have to incorporate higher startup costs that have been anticipated in our forecast. That presses on adjusted EBITDA in the short-term. We usually achieved target margin within six to nine moths depending on the specialty. This factor accounts for an additional $12 million from our earlier projections. We're also reducing expected results from Evolution Health to a slight loss, which is about $7 million change from our previous outlook.","Lastly, we're moving from our guidance approximately $24 million for combination of timing of acquisition and timing of anticipated improvement and labor utilization.","Our revised outlook for the 2017 fourth quarter includes the following: Revenue of $1.88 billion to $2.02 billion; adjusted EBITDA of $182 million to $202 million; and adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. Through all of 2017, same-contract growth for Physician Services is being modified to 2% to 3% from our previous assumption of 3% to 4%. In bridging the third quarter to fourth quarter and ignoring the impact of the hurricanes in the third quarter have accounted for a decline of approximately $54 million in adjusted EBITDA and reconcile it as follows.","The impact of one-time net settlements in adjustments and one-time favorable expense adjustments that positively impact in the third quarter, on a combined basis account for approximately $32 million. Anticipated new contract ramps in the fourth quarter over and above what we experienced in the third quarter typically due to the number of new contracts signed account for approximately $12 million. And seasonal decline in emergency visits from third quarter to fourth quarter account for the remaining $10 million. We continue to deploy our cash and cash flow for M&A in both our Physician Services and Ambulatory segments.","Before we open the call for questions, we acknowledge that our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, if annualized is less than our projected full-year results. As Chris mentioned, we actually believe the run rate of business is closer to $900 million and let me explain why. Incremental startup costs related to new contracts were $12 million in the third quarter. And as I stated, this will taper off in the next several months as we expect to start the year with normalized contributions for those contracts. That's $48 million of annualized run-rate improvement.","We are in the final stages of managed care contract negotiations for out-of-network services, in which our realized revenue yield has been lower than in the in-network rate currently being offered by those payors. We believe that this will be a $7 million quarterly benefit or greater when we accrete in-networks moves in the first quarter of 2018. The $7 million benefit or $28 million annualized is not included in our fourth quarter outlook.","Finally, we initiated operational improvement programs during the fourth quarter of 2017. These are related to the normal leverage that we can pull in response to the macro environment, as well as operating improvement initiatives that Karey mentioned in his comments. This is initial phase of what will be an ongoing effort to optimize the performance of our organization.","Our target is to $50 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA during 2018. We don't include this initiative in our fourth quarter guidance.","Well, the last thing I'll mention for your benefit, as you're thinking about our operations in 2018, remember that our results will also be improved by several known factors including the full-year contribution from acquisitions completed during 2017, remember that most of our acquisitions year-to-date occurred in the second quarter; divestiture of AMR, which will result in a larger percentage of the corporate expenses that had been allocated, continued operations, to transfer back to AMR; synergy related to the merger including both cost and revenue; and recouping the impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma on 2017 results.","We've covered a lot of ground this morning. And at this time, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning, guys. Chris, or I guess, I can ask Karey as well. You guys talked about the cost cut opportunities and how you are working to align basically with all your partners. So how should we think about the discussions with both the doctor groups and the hospitals in terms of being able to adjust to the new volume environment?","Karey Witty","Yeah, that was one of the comments I made about labor management is just that very fact, right. We're locked into staffing contracts at a structured level in regard with the volumes, so certainly that's one of the targets, would be to renegotiate those contracts with our partners to allow us to flex the staffing. So that is one of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks, and certainly, that is an opportunity for us.","Brian Tanquilut","But, I guess, my question, Karey, is how do we do that without risking physician turnover or contract turnover?","Karey Witty","Yeah, I think, I mean, at the end of the day we're always providing openings as well. So I think there is certainly a balance between optimizing a physician's skill-set and the number of hours worked. But it's not anything that we're concerned about and we think we can balance these three for sure.","Brian Tanquilut","Okay. And then, for Kevin, you talked about the anesthesia rate and also some of the ED rates being flat versus what you were expecting. If you don't mind, just explain to us what drove your old assumptions for sequential improvement. And is this something that we should just assume will carry over through 2018 or is there anything you can do, given the exchange issues in Florida, for example, to get the rates higher?","Kevin Eastridge","Sure, I think the previous forecast was using assumptions that we have seen in 2016, where we had seen an escalating increased rate in anesthesia from Q3 to Q4. That was a pretty significant uptick. Our initial forecast anticipated that that might follow that same trajectory. But as far as where we are at today, we don't feel that that's going to be a plausible assumption that we would anticipate that our rates would stay flat from Q3 to Q4.","In regard to the anesthesia - I'm sorry, in regards to the ED volumes, last year we had a downward trend in the ED volumes from Q3 to Q4, which was unusual. We normally would see an uptick on that.","And so, our previous guidance had assumed that we would have a different assumption or a different trajectory on the Q4 direction, and that we would increase its year-over-year because of the lower cost. And our current assumptions now, just assume that we would stay relatively flat to our current run-rate.","Brian Tanquilut","Got you, and then last question very quickly, Kevin, you guys gave sort of a $900 million EBITDA run-rate expectation for next year. How should we be thinking about free cash flows?","Kevin Eastridge","I think the free cash flow will be relatively similar to what we've seen this year. Of course, we won't have AMR. We're assuming that we don't have AMR in the numbers. So we're picking about a $100 million in maintenance CapEx because of that and that would be lower.","Brian Tanquilut","All right, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Just wanted to talk about the revenue guidance a little bit. If we assume normal sequential growth within the surgery center business, generally, it's a little bit seasonally stronger in the fourth quarter, not backing to what you're implying for the physician segment. It seems, if my math is right to be suggesting same-store revenue decline somewhere in the range like 1% to 10%. So just looking for any color on how this is possible.","Christopher Holden","Whit, are you saying declines from Q3 to Q4 or comparable prior periods?","Whit Mayo","No, no, no. Yeah, to the prior period, it's just the simple math. If the revenue - if your revenue was up little bit sequentially in the surgery center business and you back into it, it seems to imply year-over-year that your same-contract and new-contract growth combined is down 1 to 10, just having a very difficult time putting these numbers.","Kevin Eastridge","Now, I think on the volumes, particularly on the ED, because of lower cost we will have slightly positive volumes in the ED space. Surgery centers I think will be essentially flat in their volume from year-over-year. And in the anesthesia, I think we'd still see a positive volume rate.","Whit Mayo","Okay, maybe we'll just talk some of this offline. I mean, are you writing off any receivables in the quarter? I guess, are there any changes in your malpractice reserve? Is there any cleanup that we should be aware of?","Kevin Eastridge","No, we are not anticipating that.","Whit Mayo","Okay. And then maybe just for Chris, just you didn't provide any color on Ron Williams. He's leaving the Board, and obviously, he has affiliation with CDR and you announced strategic alternatives that can't help, but see a conflict here and just curious if there is any perspective on his decision that you could provide for us.","Christopher Holden","Yeah, Ron made the decision after fully supporting management team and the decision of the company. He is elected to pursue his duties with this private equity firm and that's the extent of my understanding of his decision.","Whit Mayo","Okay, maybe just one last one. I think in the prepared comments you referenced that there were some Sheridan tools that were being developed and deployed that are now transferrable to the ED and the hospital list segment. Just kind of curious what are you doing, what does this mean, what should we expect going forward.","Karey Witty","Yeah, thanks. It's actually the deployment of dashboards and data analytics that we have at the practice-level, at the site-level, so that our site leaders can react to changes in staffing in a more effective way on the Sheridan side. And we certainly see that being able to be implemented on the emergency medicine and hospitals medicine side.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Thanks.","Christopher Holden","Thanks, Whit.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. So, I guess, I just wanted to dig into this run rate number of EBITDA a little bit. It wasn't clear to me. Were you saying that the 2017 pace is $900 million or you were saying that 2018 kind of starting point is $900 million?","Christopher Holden","No, I think what we were saying is if you take a look at where we ended in Q4 of 2017, and you consider those things that are not necessarily in Q4, but would genesis into starting in 2018, then it would be equivalent to a starting point of roughly $900 million.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. So that $900 million includes the normalization of that startup cost of $48 million, and it includes $28 million of going in-network and it includes the $50 million of cost savings?","Kevin Eastridge","That is correct.","Kevin Fischbeck","And then from there, when you talked about kind of the growth target, I think, Chris you're talking about long-term growth targets not necessarily next year? Or are those kind of the way to think about next year as well.","Christopher Holden","Let's say, we're not giving guidance for 2018. So I think of those as - what I would call the profile of the business.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And so then, when we think about that profile, so this is a top line discussion that you're having there. Obviously, we've seen MEDNAX reported today and they're talking about Physician Services revenue growing near 2%, but EBITDA getting down 10% to 15%. So I want to understand, it is 2% to 3% Physician Services revenue growth and 1% to 3% surgery center growth that is sufficient to maintain margins? Or - so therefore EBITDA could be growing with that organic revenue growth? Or should we think about a number of being higher or lower than that for EBITDA growth?","Christopher Holden","That profile of the business is sufficient to sustain the margins, and I do believe is Karey pointed out, we have opportunities to bring the margins back in line with at least historical trends, if no better.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And so, when you think about being able to do that, is that - I guess, how long of a timeframe are you thinking about this undertaking?","Christopher Holden","Yeah, that was one issue with the guidance, is that we realized it wasn't reasonable to assume that we had the ability to execute everything in Q4 of this year. We think it may take a quarter or two. That's why we're calling it out as realized in 2018, there may - well, there is likely a ramp to that number.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. But is the expectation that as you enter 2019 things to be some degree normalized by that?","Christopher Holden","Yes.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And I guess, maybe, just the last question, because it sounds like you're having a little bit of difficulty forecasting. I think, you mentioned that forecasting ER volumes and obviously payor mix is volatile. To what degree do you feel like you do have a good sense of that heading into next year? Have you seen any signs of stabilization or anything? Because, obviously, you're doing a lot of things kind of I assume - assuming things kind of normalize or stabilize from here.","But there's obviously some indications that things might get worse next year as far as exchange enrollment or some of the administrative factors that are being heard, Medicaid enrollments. So - when you say things like getting back to target margins. How much of that is predicated on industry backed up being relatively stable versus assuming that there might be a continuation of the pressures that you're seeing this year into next?","Christopher Holden","Yeah, we've tried an additional granularity to the forecasting for the reason that you called out. We've done some incremental analysis around emergency services and anesthesia. We feel like we call it up the risk in the profiles that I've called out here today. Now - there is always the - and we hear this from time-to-time that one of the issues is inspect - particularly thinking about strategic alternatives, the beta on the macro issues is high here, but we think that we've done extra research to color that up.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom","Hi, can you hear me?","Christopher Holden","Yeah, John.","John Ransom","Okay. Last quarter you talked about how your anesthesia costs were flexible in the case of a downdraft in payor mix, which certainly has happened. Is that mitigating at all - I guess, we're getting almost $100 million EBITDA effect from anesthesia payor mix. So is that all just coming - do you take 100% of the hit, when the rate comes down contrary to what you said last quarter? How should we think about that?","Christopher Holden","Well, I think on the anesthesia side, I think, we've been able to effectively manage the direct practice expense for the most part, and adjust where appropriately. So I think, it's more that the adjustments in the rate do flow through of VP practice. So there are certain levels of profit sharing that go through. But so far, I don't think we've seen a great compression on the margin on the anesthesia side, because of the startup costs.","John Ransom","Okay. I don't understand that, but I'll follow-up offline. The other thing, talking about your $900 million, what that does not include. So I was missing a little bit of that. It does include lower startup cost, ER transition in-network and $50 million of operating improvements. In addition of that, you mentioned wraparound M&A, I assume that's included in the $900 million for your M&A. And I think you - but it would not include 2018 EBITDA or M&A, which would be something like what another $40 million, $50 million.","What else is not in that $900 million other than that - you're losing about $30 million now annualized from health, but what else is not in that $900 million other than M&A - next year's M&A that could potentially help.","Kevin Eastridge","A couple of things would not be in there. We - the synergies that we'll begin to see from the acquisition that we completed in 2017 would be incremental into 2018. New contracts that - as they continue to ramp and new contracts to get sign next year would not be in that number as well. And then, of course, just the incremental growth on the same-center from either volume or rate will not be in that number.","John Ransom","What's your - in 4Q you added a bunch of contracts. What's your growth in that contract estimate in 4Q?","Kevin Eastridge","For Q4 - for the fourth quarter, I think, we still see - we see a slight net positive at some of these terms anniversary. So I think, it will just be slightly positive.","John Ransom","Okay. What about gross contract? I know, you've got churn on stuff that you're getting rid of, but what's the gross number implied in these new contract wins?","Kevin Eastridge","25.","John Ransom","I mean, I'm looking for a percent number, sorry.","Christopher Holden","Hey, John, say that again. What percentage are you seeking?","John Ransom","No. What's your percent gross contract number for 4Q in Physician Services?","Christopher Holden","For new contracts only?","John Ransom","Yeah, you mentioned 65 new contracts in 3Q. I'm just wondering what that numbers looking like for 4Q. Did you say 25 new contracts?","Christopher Holden","No. Our run rate, we initially targeted in terms of number of contracts has been about - was about 30 to 35 per quarter, and we ended up 65 in Q3.","John Ransom","Okay. And so I was just asking what that number looks like in 4Q, so far, what's built into your model?","Christopher Holden","We're idling on your question, John. I'm not sure about that\u2026","John Ransom","Okay. That's fine.","Christopher Holden","Can we get back to you on that one, because we need to fine-tune that one for you?","John Ransom","All right. That's fine. And then just lastly, I'm looking at MEDNAX, their margins are built around 17%. I mean, your implied physician margins are 8% in the fourth quarter, I know, they're somewhat compressed and maybe something like 10% with all the good guys. That just seems awfully low. And are we way down in the low-single-digits on ER? What's driving such a negative - I know, you don't have the mix of neonate, which is a higher mix business?","But the margin in Physician Services, what's the long-term objective and what's reasonable in the new normal environment, because it just seems - that just seems off to me?","Christopher Holden","I think, if you look at the peer group, it's running 9% to 12% depending on the provider. We should be in the top end of that.","John Ransom","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning. A couple of questions. I want to make sure, I heard correctly, so part of the 3Q to 4Q sequential one-time favorable, $32 million of revenue adjustments from the third quarter? Did I hear that number correctly?","Kevin Eastridge","That was $22 million.","Gary Taylor","$22 million, got it. And what is that related to?","Kevin Eastridge","We had some basically a combination of payor settlements as well as just some net adjustments, out of period adjustments on contracts that we assessed.","Gary Taylor","Got it. I guess, I'm trying to quickly do some math, but it looks like that with - in Physician Services 1.3% revenue per encounter would be basically flat year-over-year excluding some true-up. Does that sound about right?","Kevin Eastridge","That's about right.","Gary Taylor","And could you give me what percentage of Physician Services revenues in anesthesia now, just ballpark.","Kevin Eastridge","It's about 30%.","Gary Taylor","30%. So in anesthesia, outside of the Florida exchange mix issue, are you generally generating any inflation update on your commercial contract?","Kevin Eastridge","Yes, yes. I mean, I think, we do see rate increase within our contracts. I think, what we're seeing in anesthesia, in particularly, is just that shift between within commercial between higher-paying exchanges to lower-paying exchanges. And so the rate within the contracts, and so we do have the increases.","Gary Taylor","Got it. And my last question, just trying to understand, I think, we've all been caught off guard to some degree by the level of negative operating leverage in the near term, when volume is weaker. I guess, my question is, is the primary constraint around adjusting the physician staffing levels? Is it the contractual arrangement with the hospital, the staff, certain numbers the mix of clinical professionals? Or is it the guaranteed compensation in these contracts that you have with physicians like - is one of those kind of the primary issue, they both really important to explain, this level of negative operating leverage?","Kevin Eastridge","Yeah, they're both very important in the explanation of it. The guaranteed salaries that we have for our physicians, and the lack of variable labor to an extent is a driver of that. And then secondarily, we are staffed at particular levels of coverage for our hospitals and when that's a change, unless there's an agreement written that has some form of escalators or some form of a slider. We've got to go back in and do the work to request the change in coverage and renew or redraft that contract, which certainly there's time involved with that.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And my last one, just when we think about average duration of physician contract, is that something you're willing to share publicly? Or the real gist of the question is, how quickly can you kind of deal with that issue? You've talked about that as something that's subjective, but this takes years of contract renewals to address? Or how should we think about that element of it?","Christopher Holden","We have every - there is so many permutations in the mix. I'd say, Gary, I think there is opportunities to address a significant portion of those. The issue would be the timing, as you've called out. That's why we said, there will be a ramp to this process. But at this point, when you see the business change, we've got to match the cost structure with the growth trajectory in the overall performance of the sector.","Gary Taylor","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. You had mentioned sort of some of the - I guess, optics around 4Q that's depressing that number. And I guess, I understand the onboarding is going to have sort of one-time cost. I know you talked about $12 million. I guess, I'm struggling with the other two, the benefit of sort of revenue yield on your payor contracts of moving somebody out of network to in-network actually having a positive impact. So I guess, I'm just struggling with that.","Are you going to pay rates that are lower than negotiated managed care rate in-network, I guess, that's one? And then, two, on the operational improvements, you mentioned the $50 million. I mean, how much visibility is in that number and what that predicated on in terms of volume and top-line, that you need to sustain to actually extract that type of savings?","Christopher Holden","Good question. I'd be - on the payor issue, it speaks to what we've been saying all along, is that the yield on the out-of-network is in many cases lower than what the in-network rate would be as the payors try to manipulate the process over last many years. And as we settle these out, we convert to more of the market rate. And we do in some cases, like the one we see here, we get improvements, not reductions in the payment rate.","On your second question\u2026","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, just on that, sorry. I guess, I'm still struggling, what would be the incentive of a managed care then to want to go and network with you then? I mean, if the out-of-network rate is lower anyway, why don't I just stay with the out-of-network as opposed to going in-network and then paying you more?","Christopher Holden","Great question. Two big reasons, one is from a competitive standpoint. The real issue is the price coverage. They're beneficiaries. A lot of their business is ASO. Those clients don't like for their beneficiaries to receive an out-of-network bill and the burden is on the payor to build the appropriate network.","And until recently, there really wasn't a governor that establish what a fair rate would be. And now, in many states you have the statutory billing legislation, which lays out that benchmark. And the combination of those two forces have incentivized the payors to move in-network even if it's a slight increase. Overall, it's really de minimis to their overall MLR, plus most of the health plans today are having very positive results around their MLR reduction, so it's a good time to make those adjustments.","As we've said, probably we view the surprise coverage issue as an issue that payors, providers, employers, even the government need to come together to resolve. And we've honestly had good support from the payors. Then you see it in our conversion rates and you see it in our other metrics that it has been a good decision.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, and then just on the operational improvements, the visibility?","Karey Witty","Yeah, I think, Ralph, certainly, even prior to my arrival - this is Karey - the company had engaged a third\u2013party entity to review our core revenue cycle operations. So I think as far as where are we on the pendulum of quantifying, certainly I think we got a great start on revenue cycle management. The third party study has highlighted significant opportunity for the business to improve.","I'd say, secondarily, operating efficiencies, I mean, that's certainly something which is clearly within our controls. So I don't see that as being an issue. I think we talked, we highlights some of the challenges we're going to face were in clinical management, labor management that is. But I would say, RCM and operating efficiencies, pretty good visibility, and certainly to a lesser extent the labor management. Certainly we got that, we'll be developing work-streams around each of the three of these.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, fair enough. And then, just my last one, I guess, when you first came together with Envision AMSURG, the projected EBITDA was $1.6 billion plus I think. I certainly understand we've got the AMR sale that we need to consider and there've been macro pressures. But the magnitude is just much greater than what we've seen from anyone else. I mean, is there anything or do you think there have been dissynergies to this point with the deal, any color you can provide on sort of just the magnitude of those pressures and the ability to sort of baseline it at this point? Thanks.","Kevin Eastridge","I think the biggest delta, when you keep in mind that original number, which I think you're a little hard on those included AMR, which was over $300 million, maybe close to - including the overhead, it's probably closer to $340 million, somewhere in that zone. Most of the remaining delta is the gap, the difference between the organic assumptions and what the market has actually done in that period of time.","We're probably 250 basis points off from the original organic assumptions which were generated in April of 2016, yeah. That was far in advance of the election. It was in the time when the trajectory for all volumes were very high. I don't know that anyone has properly trajected emergency services volume in 2017, given that there is precedence and everything. And we've guided down I think about 100 basis points each quarter sequentially on emergency services. We're now selling in at flat.","There most of the data suggest that 1% to 2% is probably a rational number. It depends on how you view the comps and how you view whether the impact of the Medicaid, reforms and the threats around ACA repeal and replace might affect it long-term. So, long answer to your question is the real delta in the model is around the initial assumptions on organic growth rate.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, all right, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Nick Hiller","Hi, this is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. I just have one quick question. Could you drive any color on what drove the swing in evolution from a profit back down to a loss?","Kevin Eastridge","Yeah, within evolution, there is a little bit of pressure on the volumes and we've been experiencing just a little bit more bad debt there.","Nick Hiller","All right, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. I was interested in your comments about the better yield on the move from out-of-network, in-network. Have you - would you be able to quantify that and would you expect this next 37% batch of conversions to also come out with a favorable net rate? Thanks.","Christopher Holden","Well, we just - we said, for this process it generally yields a revenue-neutral impact to the company. We know that, for example, in this case, we have a specific set of contracts that warrant the - treating it as an exception for try and determine what our true run rate is.","Frank Morgan","Okay. And maybe one other - just obviously the more conservative assumptions on utilization going forward, but is that just conservative assumption or are you actually seeing anything specifically so far in the fourth quarter that you could comment on? Thank you very much. I'll hop off.","Christopher Holden","I think, Frank, honestly, we're trying to improve the granularity and testing and the sequential analytics that are driving those numbers, so that we can more effectively match our cost structure. We're really trying to - I think this is part of what we view as improving our operational focus and excellence, is that we got to make this pivot and to make those assumptions hit. If for some reason the growth comes back, then we're - we know we can adjust to that, but we really want to prepare for a more, I think, conservative case based on what we've seen coming out of Q3, so that we can right-size the organization.","Operator","And we'll take the last question from Tejus Ujjani with Goldman Sachs.","Tejus Ujjani","Hi, just going back to the $900 million run rate of EBITDA kind of coming out of the year, on a comparable basis to last year excluding AMR. I mean, it's still like a 7% year-over-year decline. Can you help us unpack that, just on rough terms of like the same-store versus net new contracts and how much is acquired? Like I know you had some contract terminations, but presumably, that was EBITDA negative or breakeven or low EBITDA margin business, so just trying to understand what's really happened there.","Kevin Eastridge","Well, I think a big part of that is in the organic, where we see experiencing the organic growth rates, and of course, both in volume, as well as the rate, and I think that's the underlying lynchpin on that piece of it.","Tejus Ujjani","So you're saying that same-store EBITDA declined on a gross basis as well?","Kevin Eastridge","Roughly flat, I think.","Tejus Ujjani","Okay, but then, I guess, what would account for the rest of it? I mean, it's still kind of a 7% decline, like you've got some acquisition in the year that should be benefiting. Again, the contract termination should be helpful, because that's a lower-margin business. So, I mean, I'm just trying to understand it. Is there some kind of revisiting to even just longer-term outlook of EBITDA growth as well?","Kevin Eastridge","No, I mean, I think our long-term outlook for the EBITDA growth would be similar to what we had seen or what we're assessing between 2017 and 2018, specifically in that - somewhere in the 8% to 9%, 10% growth rate.","Tejus Ujjani","Okay. All right, thanks very much.","Christopher Holden","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to hand the call back over Mr. Holden for any additional or closing comments.","Christopher Holden","Thank you, Vicky. Let me end by making a few comments. First of all, I really want to, again, take this opportunity to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the clinical teams of Envision Healthcare, Envision Physician Services, and American Medical Response, who are on the frontline as medical first-responders for the floods in Houston and Southeast Texas, Hurricane Irma in Florida and the tragedy in Las Vegas.","I'd say leadership, compassion and selflessness were the themes that best describe the contributions of our colleagues confronted by all these remarkable challenges. It's really a privilege to serve with these many heroes, who really made a difference in the lives of so many. And I want to end by recognizing both Claire Gulmi and Bob Coward for their outstanding service and contribution to Envision Healthcare and the legacy organizations. Both Claire and Bob dedicated much of their professional lives to improving the lives of others and developing the next generation of healthcare leaders.","And on behalf of the Envision family, we want to thank them publically. We wish Claire and Bob the best, and let them know that their legacies will be part of this organization for many years to come. With that, I'd like to thank you all for joining the call. And I'm going to now turn the call back over to Vicky. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO, and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this point.","I will turn the call over to Mr. Craig Wilson, General Counsel, who will read the legal statement.","Craig A. Wilson - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, operator.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially.","We encourage you to review the \"Risk Factors\" section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports including the Form 10-Q to be filed later this week. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this morning along with our remarks today are made as of today, Tuesday, November 1, 2016, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued this morning, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website. All comparisons included in our presentation today are for the 2016 period to the comparable period in 2015, unless otherwise noted.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. During the period, when patient volumes continued to be below expectations, we reported strong top line and bottom line growth for the third quarter of 2016.","During the third quarter, revenue grew by 20%, adjusted EBITDA was up 27%, and adjusted EPS of $0.36 increased by 20%. Through the nine months, year-over-year, our revenue was up 23%, and adjusted EBITDA has increased by 16%.","We continue to grow rapidly, as our clinical services deliver a high level of patient and customer satisfaction, while at the same time pioneering new healthcare delivery models. We are diversifying our service offerings, leading advances in integrated care and participating in innovative reimbursement programs, all the while continuing to post strong double-digit growth rates.","Results at EmCare were solid for the third quarter, in line with our expectations, despite the same-store soft volumes. We continue to advance programs that are resulting in improved support for our clinical professionals while achieving operating efficiencies and customer satisfaction. Our pipeline for new contracts has been expanding, and in the coming months, we expect an acceleration of our contract starts. At this point, we have more than 50 committed contract starts to the fourth-quarter of 2016 in the first quarter of 2017.","We also continue to work with our health system partners to improve contract performance. As important, we are adhering to our principles and disciplines of exiting underperforming contracts, resulting in improved adjusted EBITDA margins. At AMR, while same market emergency transport volume growth was lower than our expectations, it was offset by improved financial results at Rural Metro as we continue to integrate it into AMR.","We also are realizing contributions from a number of new health system contracts. Investments made earlier this year in key Rural Metro markets to improve service response times have solidified our relationships with communities. In those markets, the increased costs associated with recruiting and training staff have been significantly reduced, and we are moving towards normalized operating metrics.","Our integration activities during the quarter included the consolidation of a number of geographic markets, the conversion of our revenue cycle processes and the completion of our electronic medical record platform in legacy AMR markets. Also at AMR during the quarter, we added new contracts with over 100,000 annualized transports. We also expect to start a number of new relationships over the next two quarters with annualized volumes of over 100,000 additional transports.","We continue to broaden the scope of AMR's mobile integrated healthcare practice, and recently acquired a transportation business focused on behavioral health patients in Arizona. This is a very unique business, which, we believe, can be expanded to other markets.","Moving onto Evolution Health, we are very encouraged by the sequential improvement of our financial results. I'm pleased to report that we are realizing benefits from our active engagements with at-risk patient populations, and saw a reduction in our IBNR in the first quarter.","Our approach is generating meaningful cost savings for the care delivered to this particular population. Last month, our preliminary clinical results were published in a peer-reviewed journal, demonstrating the initial benefits of active engagement with patient populations at risk for high utilization. In fact, Dr. Eric Beck, our Evolution Health CEO, was recently recognized by Modern Healthcare as one of the select groups of up and comers in the healthcare industry for his work in the population health management.","Our improved results at Evolution Health also reflect favorable development from our participation in BPCI. In the third quarter, we were able to recognize a higher level savings achieved under the episodes of care that we managed. Our participation in bundled payment programs provide the organization with the necessary experience to deliver high quality at a lower cost, and to prepare us for new initiative and incentive models.","Also, it is noteworthy that our investments in technology and processes have well positioned us for the new requirements under the mandated macro. In addition, we've engaged with AMSURG on integration planning, we believe, they are very well positioned for macro as well. Over the past several years, our investments in key initiatives have led to the development of integrated care models, resulting in effective and efficient care coordination.","We are doing this in a particular partnership with many of our nation's leading health systems, including joint ventures with HCA, Universal, and Ascension. We believe we are in the early stages of this journey, and the opportunities are abound. It's a strategic vision that is shared by our partners at AMSURG, which is why we're so excited about the pending merger.","The merger is on track for completion in the fourth quarter of this year. We are increasingly confident that the new Envision Healthcare will be uniquely positioned as a trusted partner, delivering solutions to health systems, clinicians, communities, payers, and to further shape the future healthcare delivery.","Pursuant to the merger, we've identified the leadership team for our organization, and developed a transitional plan to ensure continuity of services in the communities while integrating our operations. After closing, we will focus our energies on identifying growth opportunities for our new organizations. We are encouraged by the positive interest we've received from many of our current health system partners. They understand the value of a physician-driven organization that provides comprehensive service offerings, such as the new Envision.","They also appreciate the value of a physician service organization that is aligned with health system partners to achieve improved outcomes. We also believe our combined organizations will attract more clinicians and provider groups as a result of our innovative support and delivery models, including our proven ability to adapt to a rapidly changing healthcare environment.","Now, before turning the call over to Randy, I want to thank all the clinicians and employees who are so dedicated and have made this company one of the leading healthcare services provider organizations in the country. It's been an honor and a pleasure to serve as your CEO. And I look forward to continuing to contribute to the new Envision in a governance capacity and working closely with Chris Holden, who will be our new CEO under the new Envision.","Randy?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we reported solid third quarter results that were in line with the outlook we provided during our second quarter call, in spite of weaker industry volumes.","Adjusted EBITDA was $180.7 million, at the lower end of our range. Adjusted EPS was $0.36 a share, and cash flow from our operations was $93.2 million.","We're successfully managing certain issues at AMR and Evolution Health that impacted our second quarter 2016 results. These include measures to improve financial performance in certain Rural Metro markets, and the realization of medical cost savings in our Florida health plan contract.","At EmCare, third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, though in many markets volumes were softer than expected, consistent with what has been reported by other healthcare providers in the quarter.","I'll provide a quick summary of the financial results we reported this morning as well as a discussion of our revised outlook for 2016. Envision's revenue of $1.64 billion grew by 19.8% from the prior year. Income from operations was $83.3 million and grew by 38.9%.","Adjusted EBITDA of $180.7 million increased 26.8%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% improved by 60 basis points over Q3 of 2015 and 50 basis points over Q2 of 2016. Net income was $25.9 million in the quarter and grew by 50.2%. On a per share basis, fully diluted GAAP EPS was $0.13, up 44.4%, and adjusted EPS of $0.36 increased by 20%.","Shifting to our review of our operating businesses, EmCare's total revenue was $1.06 billion, an increase of 13%. Revenue growth at our hospital-based physician services was 6.8%, while revenue growth was 105.9% for our post-acute services through our Evolution Health brand. Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months contributed 9% to EmCare's overall revenue growth and organic revenue growth was 4%.","Our organic revenue growth in the quarter consisted entirely of same-store growth and was offset by a slight decline in revenue from net new contracts. When calculating same-store revenue growth on a comparable same contract base to last year, growth was 6% overall, consisting of a 4.3% rate growth and volume growth of 1.7%.","Same-store volume growth at EmCare's largest service line, emergency services, was 1.1%. Same-store volume growth was a little higher for hospitalists and radiology services lines, and lower on anesthesia services. Same-store revenue per visit for the quarter increased by 3.4%, when excluding the impact of Evolution Health driven by improvements in same-store rate across all service lines, including emergency, hospitalist, radiology and anesthesia. This was primarily driven by improvements in collections per visit and increased subsidies at a number of hospitalist contracts.","Revenue from net new contracts declined by 1.1% in the quarter as a result of higher contract terminations during the preceding 12 months, including third quarter 2016. Evolution Health contributed 6% new contract growth, driven primarily from the expansion of our relationship with Ascension and the Florida health plan contract, offset by a 7.1% decline in physician services. Of the 7.1% decrease, 3.5% is a result of restructuring contracts to management services agreements as we discussed in the last call and a 3.6% decline in revenue from net new contracts.","Net new contracts added 6.5% growth, offset by terminations of 10.1%. Contracts terminated during the third quarter increased slightly from recent periods. These were from a few underperforming contracts with negative contract margins that we exited after efforts to improve financial performance were not successful. While our Q3 contract starts were lower than in previous quarters, some contract starts were delayed, and we're expecting a significant increase in starts in Q4 2016 and Q1 of 2017 based on more than 50 contract start commitments.","EmCare's income from operations was $73.6 million and grew by 155%, which includes changes in restructuring and transaction costs quarter-over-quarter. Operating margin of 7% improved by 390 basis points.","On a sequential basis, EmCare's income from operations grew by 11% and margins improved by 70 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $113.9 million, or 10.8% of segment revenue. This included adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million at Evolution, with a margin of 1.4%. When excluding Evolution Health, EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was $112.2 million or 12% of revenue.","The change in certain expenses, as a percent of revenue, has shifted year-over-year. Compensation benefits are lower by approximately 380 basis points due to improvements in physician staffing and the impact of our Florida health plan contract, where a majority of the costs are included in operating expenses.","Insurance as a percent of revenue has improved primarily as a result of changes in prior year development. Our post-acute services through Evolution Health brand generated third quarter revenue of $120.5 million, up 105.9%, with adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million, or 1.4% of revenue.","Our financial results improved at Evolution Health on a sequential basis as a result of improvements in our actuarial results for our Florida risk-based contract, and the realization of savings under BPCI for episodes managed in the second half of 2015.","We've seen favorable reductions in IBNR in each of the last three months in our Florida contract. AMR's revenue of $583.6 million grew by 34.6%, and was driven from acquisition growth of 31.4%, principally from Rural Metro. Organic revenue grew by 3.2%, and includes 2.2% growth from net new contracts and existing market growth was 1%.","On a comparable market basis, market growth was 1.2%, and consisted of volume growth of 1.8%, offset by a 0.6% rate decline. Emergency same market volume growth was 0.7%, which is at the lower end of our recent year's experience. Non-emergency same market volume growth and net new contract growth was higher due to our success working with health systems. AMR's same market rate decline was primarily driven by lower managed transportation revenue.","AMR's income from operations was $9.7 million, or 1.7% of revenue, compared with $31.1 million, or 7.2% of revenue. Operating income was impacted by higher depreciation and amortization expense as well as higher transaction cost. AMR's adjusted EBITDA was $66.8 million in the third quarter, up 19%. Margin was 11.4%, which is down 150 basis points from the prior year period.","AMR margins were lower due to the impact of lower than expected volumes in a number of AMR markets, and due to the impact of lower Rural margins of 10.7% in the quarter. Rural's results were improved from the previous quarter where margins were 6.4% due to the integration efforts from both operations and billing processes. A majority of the market and billing process integration will be completed by year-end and will be fully completed by Q2 2017.","As I've stated in the past, as we integrate Rural Metro into AMR, it will be increasingly difficult to separate legacy AMR's results from Rural Metro, as those markets will now be combined. We continue to make progress with Rural Metro integration, and believe that we will realize our targeted earnings contribution from this acquisition by the end of 2017.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $93.2 million, up from $34 million in the prior year period, largely because of the improvements in working capital as well as net income. Our DSOs for Envision declined by two days year-to-date, driven by lower DSO at EmCare. DSO at AMR was up in the quarter, principally due to billing integrations in the quarter, which will revert back once the integration is completed.","Adjusted free cash flow was $47.7 million in the quarter, which compares with $23 million in third quarter 2015. CapEx in the third quarter was $35 million, higher than last year's period and primarily related to investments to support new market growth and Rural Metro investments.","The company closed two acquisitions at the end of the quarter, including the behavioral health acquisition Bill mentioned, and a physician group acquisition with a total net consideration of $66 million. At September 30, we had cash on hand of $190 million, total debt was $3.1 billion with net debt of $2.9 billion.","In our press release this morning, we updated our outlook for 2016. At this time, we expect to earn adjusted EBITDA of $705 million to $715 million and adjusted EPS of $1.39 to $1.42 for 2016. This adjustment is primary due to lower volume growth rates in the third quarter, which we now believe could continue into the fourth quarter.","Operator, at this point, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. And I guess, this will be your last call as Envision, so congrats, again, on getting the company sold and merged. So number one question Bill or Randy, as we think about the changes in rules on out-of-network reimbursement, obviously, we've seen that in California in the Centene (21:08) ruling, how do you think that impacts your business, number one, given your out-of-network exposure? And the second, how is that translating into your negotiations for in-network rates with your payers, with the commercial insurance companies?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Sure, Brian, and thank you for the comments. First off, I want to remind you that the decision to stay in network or go out of network is in collaboration with the hospital. I'll take a moment just to refresh everyone's memory that when we do respond to an RFP, we do analysis based on whether or not there will be a subsidy, and whether or not based on the desire of the hospital we go in or out of network. So that decision is driven by the hospital, generally, the CFO.","If we decide to go out of network, it usually is negotiated with the health plan, and numbers are somewhat between UCR and the discount the hospital typically receives. We have not had any real difficulty working with our hospital clients. If we have to go into network, we will back \u2013 we generally will negotiate a subsidy or a change in the contract. And so it's really driven by the hospital desire. As it relates to negotiating rates, I think, we have been quite successful negotiating some favorable rates when the hospital asked us to go back into network, and many times we don't have to go back to the hospital with a large request for subsidies, sometimes a very small subsidy. And so, even though, there has been a lot of activity and a lot of anxiety around out-of-network, we continue to manage it in a very effective manner. Randy, you want to add to that?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","No. I think, Brian, it's not a new issue for us. Obviously, I think, we've talked about that for some period of time. I think reiterating Bill's point that we are working with the hospital and aligned with the hospital in terms of making sure that total reimbursement for a contract meets the needs of what a hospital would have, whether that's from third-party payers or from the hospital.","So we've always thought that that would over time decline, and again, we've had changes where in some cases we've had some reductions, but we've also had many cases where we're increasing rates. And so, we've not seen a real overall blended rate pressure. And as we talked before, like in Florida, many states are moving toward more objective data that we, in the provider community believe, is the more proper basis in terms of how we deal with rates.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. And then shifting gears just to the contract exit, is there anything you would call out? I mean, was there anything incremental this quarter beyond just going on with, continuing with the strategy of exiting underperforming markets? Are we seeing increased competitive pressures for new contracts at the hospitals?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","No, Brian, not really. I mentioned you know, I think last quarter, I don't know the exact number, but our terms were about 9%, it was 10%. This time it was slightly higher. There were handful of contracts that we've been working on and decided to exit.","Most of that the higher terms that we talked before will \u2013 but when we get into next year we'll have turned over, and so you won't see the same level of terminations. So I think it's more of the normal part of the business and being disciplined about that. I think the thing we're probably most excited about is, Bill mentioned and I as well, is from the new contract starts there's still a lot of momentum, as mentioned we have commitments for a significant number of new starts in both Q4 and Q1. So I think, you'll see, as we've said before, a much more positive net new contract contribution next year.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Tejus Ujjani on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to talk a little bit more about the volume environment. It looks like it's expected to be kind of softer going to 4Q from everybody's guidance. And then I know you're mentioning these new contract starts for Q4, Q1, but can you kind of give us any updates, kind of more longer-term, how you view same-store growth versus net new contract going forward, and what's driving kind of slightly more tempered view from where we were two years ago. Is it more competition, market saturation in terms of hospitals wanting to outsource? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","This is Randy. Let me start. Look, over the years \u2013 look, volume do change year in and year out. In some years, you have higher volumes. We saw that with some of the ACA implementation in the last couple of years. But I remember, even before ACA, we had one year where volumes were pretty flat. And so, look, some of it's seasonal, whether you have harsh weathers, flu, there are different things that affect volumes in any different year.","So this year happens to be, I think, for us and others kind of on the low end of what you've seen historically. Our same key emergency same volume growth is around 1% for both AMR and EmCare, which is on the low end of the range. We've typically seen anywhere from 2% or 3% as probably more of a normal. So, I think, just this year seems to be softer. But over the long term, we're still seeing growth more in that 2% to 3%. So it's nothing that we're overly concerned about in the environment. So there is nothing dramatically different in terms of the competitive environment.","Obviously, as we said, we're still successful in terms of new contract starts, and have a lot of opportunities there, not only at EmCare, but we're seeing some new momentum at AMR around working with health systems and being able to meet their needs. So I think we're still pretty bullish about revenue growth going forward.","And to your last point on net new contracts at EmCare, I think, we've said historically that we would expect that net contribution next year even prior to some of the integration process with AMSURG to be more in that 5% or 6% positive net range at EmCare.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much. And just a quick follow-up question. Can you call out any trends in your labor markets in terms of use of contract labor, wage inflation, pockets of shortages, anything like that?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Look, we are certainly seeing challenges as it relates to physician compensation, but it's more regionally related. And primarily we find them in markets that have a fair amount of freestanding EDs. But generally speaking, we don't see the challenge going into 2017 excessively greater than we saw in previous years, although there's a slight uptick.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, you line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to your comment on guidance and the views that volumes are going to be a little bit weaker. It sounds like it was maybe both on EmCare and AMR. I just want to see if there was one side of the business that maybe was more impacted than another, and then within those businesses, if there's any areas of pressure, whether it's ED or anesthesiology, or whatever it's ER or whether it's managed transport volume that you had spiked there?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Kevin, it's Randy. Let me start with that. So, one, look we do see a little softer emergency volume. It's primarily on the EmCare emergency side, just like we saw in Q3 where it was a little lower and on the AMR emergency transport side. So it just seems lower. It's about 1%, again, in the third quarter. It was still a little softer going into October. And whether it's just mild weather or seasonal things, we've not seen yet some of the uptick that we a lot of time see later in the fourth quarter. So we're just being a little cautious on that. Another subset of that was Hurricane Matthew, while concentrated, had a larger impact on our East Coast operations, Florida and the Carolinas, for that period of time on the overall volumes in October. So we're just being a little more cautious given the recent trends.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess, going to Evolution, can you talk a little about \u2013 I guess, it wasn't exactly clear to me what was driving the improvement? It sounds like, I guess, last quarter you were saying that you thought you were operating well, but the actuaries really weren't letting you show that in the financials because they needed to see the experience. Are you saying now that you've had a few more \u2013 another quarter and that's given them comfort in letting you flow that through to the bottom line, or was there something else going on?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","No, Kevin, that's it. I mean that really is it. We've said there's always a lag between the metrics that we're seeing, which were positive. And it just takes more time than we originally thought in terms of seeing enough completion factor on the claim payments in order to do that. So that is exactly what happened in the last three months, we were able to reduce the IBNR in each of the months, which we're pleased with because it was in line with what we were expecting from the metrics.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So you're continuing to perform well.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, and we still expect it to improve over time. It's still not fully mature, but we are starting to see that. So that was good news.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the net contract terminations, I guess. Is the higher termination rate at all any indication of you going back to get a higher subsidy from the hospital, and maybe being unsuccessful, and essentially having to terminate? Is there sort of incremental pressures there? And then just you mentioned 50 new contracts start commitments, which is a pretty hefty number for the fourth quarter and, I guess, in the first quarter. Can you give us any sense of size of revenue contribution of those 50 new contracts, as we think about the out year?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Ralph. It's Randy. So, look, one, on the terminations, again, it was a little higher. There were a handful of contracts where we were trying to work something out with some changes in those markets and with subsidy and we just weren't successful.","So there was nothing really that speaks to, I think, on a broader sense, other than just in certain region we wanted to see positive margins and just weren't successful. So we decided to turn those contracts, but nothing new in the \u2013 no sea change in the environment. So the contracts, again, we've got commitments for just over 50 contract starts Q4 and Q1, so in the next two quarters. And so that's good news.","Revenue, Ralph, on contracts are generally, depending on the size of the contract, anywhere from probably $3 million to $4 million a contract. If it's medium sized, it's probably closer to $4 million. So that gives you an idea of the revenue impact, I think.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Very helpful. And then just second question, this is sort of second quarter in a row of pretty strong pricing, up over 4% on the EmCare side. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Obviously, there's concern in the market around out-of-network and balanced bill, yet you certainly are showing pretty nice pricing yield. When do you expect that stat to shake out over time?","And maybe along those lines, I don't know if you've given this in the past, but any sense, or can you give us what percentage of managed care contracts are essentially locked in for 2017, and maybe the average rate increase that you're able to negotiate with managed care? Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. One, Ralph, I don't think we're going to go into that public in terms of what those rates are, as you would imagine. A lot of the contracts are kind of evergreen kind of contracts and they have different periods. So I would say a majority of the ones where we have specific contracts, those are set for 2017. We're always negotiating contracts at any point in time.","So, look, one of the things if you look at, a couple of things, one from last year, if you'll recall, we did see improvement in anesthesia yield. As you recall, we had challenges from the year before. So this year we have seen better improvement with anesthesia with a better billing process. So that's a contributor. But otherwise we have been successful in negotiating on a net basis improved rates. While in some markets we may reduce rates slightly, overall, we have been able to raise rates, especially on payers with much lower reimbursement rates. We have been successful in doing that.","So it is, Ralph, to your point, probably, a little higher than I would think of as ongoing 4%. We've always thought of rate always \u2013 also being in sort of that kind of 2% to 3% range. But overall we have been successful in seeing a net improvement in managed care contracting overall.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from A. J. Rice of UBS. Your line is open.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. First of all, I might just ask for any update on the integration work you're doing with AMSURG. Does it leave you feeling better about the synergy opportunity? Any other things you've learned that you'd highlight for us. And on these contract wins, with respect to that, is the fact that you have this pending deal with AMSURG a factor in these wins in any way, or is this directly Envision standalone making the pitch for these contracts?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, A. J. It's Bill Sanger. Look, it's hard to say as it relates to the last part of your question whether or not the 50 committed contracts in Q4 and Q1 is related to the announcement of the merger with AMSURG. Keep in mind, we have historically over a period of 12 months signed anywhere between 80 contracts and 100 contracts.","Do I think it may have some influence? Perhaps so. If you look at the suite of services that the combined entity will offer, it's pretty comprehensive. And we have had interest, certainly interest from health systems and hospitals. We're obviously in a hold pattern until we complete the merger.","As it relates to the former question, we have been very active in terms of the integration activity, we've been planning over the last several months. And I am sure when AMSURG does their call, Chris is going to talk a little bit more about the implications of our stated cost savings. But we're very comfortable that the stated numbers that we've shared with the market will be achievable in 2017 and 2018.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","A. J., this is Randy. Just one other thing to that just to make sure. Look, until the deal is done, we are still both selling separately. Right. So there has been interest and maybe that helps. But we are selling on our own, and we can't do that until the deal has closed. And as Bill said, there has been a lot of integration planning. But the actual efforts on that really can't get started until the deal is closed, but I think and I assume you'll hear that from Chris as well, we feel like we're very well prepared for implementation once the deal is closed.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe also a follow-up on the M&A front, tuck-in deals and so forth, obviously, you got a lot of focus just getting the AMSURG deal done, has your pace on the M&A deals, have you stepped back from the market in any way? Is there a pipeline that you will take end of the deal closing? What are you sort of seeing on the M&A front with the tuck-in deals?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","We have not slowed down the activity in the organization. Certainly, we've been challenged from the lower volumes, but organic growth, as it relates to signing new contracts and targeted acquisitions are on track. I can't say we are going to bring acquisitions into the merged entity, obviously it's kind of a forward-looking statement; however, we continue to look at opportunities in the marketplace. There seems to be more opportunities than there have been in the past, and I think as the future unfolds, and we're a single entity, those opportunities will be further enhanced for us to execute on.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, A. J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Close of Canaccord Genuity. Sir, your line is open.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great, thank you. Congratulations on the progress in the upcoming merger. Bill and Randy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the lower volume on the ER side. Do you think there could be anything structural there? I mean, obviously, you have more urgent care retail clinics, the emergent of telemedicine, and just want to get your thoughts whether you think there is a possible maybe long-term shift away from the ER a little bit?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Well, look, it's a proverbial question that since the first urgent care center went up 30 years ago has been asked a ton on these calls. That's notwithstanding \u2013 look, at anytime there are additional options. It's going to have some effect. However, if you look at the growth of ED visits, hospital-based ED visits over the last, since 2000, one year there's been an increase anywhere between 1% and 4%. I do believe that the proliferation of urgent care centers, fast track centers and EDs, do create additional demand. And as such, they may over time have a slight effect, and this is my presumption here, a slight effect on hospital-based ED visits but not material.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","And Richard, the other thing important to note is that we also \u2013 we staff a number of freestanding emergency rooms and urgent care centers when they are affiliated with our hospital partners. So there may be a shift of location on some of that, but freestanding is really more of a \u2013 in certain geographies it's that as Bill said earlier, it's more of a recruiting challenge than an actual volume challenge. But, look, I don't know that we would say there's here now a sea change. I remember back in 2013, ED volumes were flat to negative in the industry, and then they came back. So there always is some movement here, but in certain markets, you will see maybe a little bit more than you would on a global basis.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. And as a follow-up, Bill, can you talk a little bit about Evolution Health, the pipeline there, and maybe types of contracts from a service perspective, anything like the Ascension JV in the pipeline?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Well, we don't get into specific detail to describe the number of contracts generally in the pipeline, because these are very large contracts that take a long time to negotiate.","I will tell you that the results that we are seeing in terms of assisting our Florida health plan agreement in terms of lowering their MLR, the medical loss ratio, has been significant, and has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace. We are in discussions with other large health plans. We are being very measured in our approach towards the risk taking in the future.","We took this first contract. We've learned a lot. We've been able to save a significant amount of money for our partner contract, and we are positioning now to take further contracts, mitigating the type of risks or the guarantee savings we get. So I would say that 2017 will clearly be a year for Evolution Health, and you'll see more contracts, large contracts being signed with health plans.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paula Torch of Avondale Partners. Ma'am your line is open.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. I had a question on the new contracts. I was wondering if anything has changed over the last year of what you can share with us in terms of the vetting process, or the way in which you maybe choose to enter into new contracts. And as we look at the 50 contracts, was the pool of the pipeline those 50 contracts came out of much higher, meaning are you more disciplined when you're looking at taking on new contracts?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Well, I hate to use the word more disciplined. We have a very specific process when we respond to an RFP. The RFP goes through a vetting process that includes operations and financial review, a review of the managed care contracting, a review of the environment of a hospital. We seek a targeted margin on each of those contracts. We maintain that discipline.","Now, what's changed a bit is the fact that we've kind of enhanced the vetting process, and we've also entered into many of the contracts with an earlier out for both us and the other party. Generally, we were signing contracts, it was a no out for the first year. We've changed that, so that if the performance is not at the levels that we believe or the hospital believes, we can exit them a bit earlier.","We're certainly more disciplined in looking at those contracts earlier than we have in the past. And if they're not performing, we may exit a little bit earlier than we would have in the past as well. In the past, we had to stay with that contract for a year. We worked very hard to try to get it to a level. But frankly after six months or so, if the contract is not performing to the level of the pro forma of that period, generally, it's good to move from that point.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","And, Paula, this is Randy. I think one thing that, and I think we even talked about this a little bit in the last call maybe is, again, we are continuing to see additional interest from systems and facilities around multiple services, and integration of services and being able to demonstrate the kind of partner we are that's reliable and that obviously impacts their metrics.","So I think what we've seen that is what's continuing, and part of what we think will even be enhanced with the merger, having again even a much stronger suite of collective services. So I think it's really that trend that continues. And we're seeing more RFPs or RFIs around looking for a common provider for multiple services.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I'll just add a few comments to that, Paula. Notwithstanding, there's contrarian views relative to selling suite of services, we are now responding and seeing multiple service requests from a single provider. We are responding to four and five requests from a single hospital for a single provider to do anesthesia, hospitalist, ED, neonatology, radiology. This is a phenomena that is getting tremendous traction, not just with the health systems but also with the smaller hospitals, with the two or three level hospitals. So I do believe the notion of integrated offering will get further attraction in the future.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","No. that's great. Thank you. So, then, obviously, it's fair to say that some of these terminated contracts will \u2013 I mean, they'll anniversary, but maybe will never see a complete anniversarying. I mean, it obviously sounds like it could be an ongoing process. So the 5% to 6% in net new contracts that you expect longer-term, is that sort of net of potential terminations, or should we expect to see offsets to that from time to time as you periodically give yourself the chance to maybe exit out of something that is not particularly working as well as you thought you had?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Paula, this is Randy. Look, the industry, there has always been more churn in the emergency service line, if you will, than other service lines. So we've always seen historically terminations of anywhere from, say, 3% to 4%. And so that 5% or 6% would be net of that, right. So we would expect to see new contract starts of, let's call it, anywhere from call it, 8% to 10% and you might have, again, 3% to 4% offset in term. So that's been the case in the 15 years that I've been here. So there is \u2013 this year was unusual given issues from last year, but we think next year we'll revert back to more of the mean, if you will, and you'll see a more normal net contribution.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much for clarifying that. And if I may just put in one other one, can you make maybe any comments on exchanges and potential disruptions, given some of the markets where we're seeing a little bit less competition, just in terms of your conversations with hospitals? Do we see sort of any issues there that you think might surface?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Paula, not really. Look, it's always been a very minor thing for us, probably maybe 2% \u2013 1% or 2% of our volumes on the emergency side. So it really has never been a big factor, and to my knowledge, has not come up recently in any big discussions with hospitals around services. So we don't anticipate any real impact there.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Excellent. Thank you so much. Congratulations on the merger and good luck with the integration.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. One more on just the 50 new contracts, do these require any startup investments? Should they be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter? I'm just curious, if they're concentrated with a handful of systems, if they're bundled. Just trying to think about the diversification within the 50 contracts.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","No, I think there are some systems. There's no one thing that's a huge part of that. It should flow like we've normally seen where the initial contribution is not that significant in Q4. I wouldn't expect that because you always do have startup costs. I think we talked before that it may take 3 months to 6 months to sort of mature with the recruiting. So nothing unusual about that and I think that's more of a contribution as you go into 2017, or even through 2017.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just the diversification within the 50 contracts.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, again, no one large system. I think it's fairly distributed. There are some multiple services at some systems, but it's more ED just because that's what we're still seeing, ED and hospitalists tend to be the larger adds that we've seen. So I think that's the only thing that I would tell you, but nothing from a system or geographic concentration.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful. And just I run the risk of getting shut down on this question, but you haven't updated your 2017 forecast since the proxy came out a while back. You brought your 2016 range down modestly. Just any color or thoughts around headwinds, tailwinds for next year, just any way we could maybe get an update on your view of 2017? Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yes, look, I don't think we've \u2013 we haven't made any real changes there. I think we're still obviously pretty excited about the opportunity here, not only we're seeing, again, still good momentum from EmCare even with sales pre-merger AMR, we're seeing improvements at Rural Metro. So I think we are seeing things moving forward, Evolution improvement. So I think we do feel good about that. Obviously, we feel even better about, as a combined business, that what we have to offer will be enhanced. And I think that's what we've been talking about. And we think that Chris and Claire will talk about that later today as well. So I think we still feel very good about not only 2017 but even beyond that.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. It's worth a shot. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Hambly of Stephens. Your line is open.","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the new contracts, are there any of those new contracts that include more than the ED and hospitalist lines of service?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Well, there are, but a majority of our starts continue to be ED and hospitalist, but there are other anesthesia and other services. Surgery is one that, again, while still small has been getting a lot of attention and we're seeing a lot of request for some of our surgical services. I don't know, Bill, if you want to add?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","We're also seeing a renewed interest in radiology.","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","And our surgery program is really taking off, but surgery and radiology seem to be taking a lot of interest in the last quarter or so.","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Are those bundled with the ED, hospitalist, or are they separate contracts?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Bundled.","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Bundled, okay. And then, Randy...","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","The surgery is not bundled, but radiology is.","(52:23)","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, Randy, I thought you mentioned on the pricing increase that you were seeing increased subsidies with hospitalist. I'm not sure if I heard that correctly. But if so, is that unusual, or is that something you've seen going on for a while.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","No. We have had \u2013 the hospitalist specialty for us is not unusual for that to be subsidized. Just because you are seeing more growth there, it needs more resources. And sometimes the mix at the hospitals because you're dealing with unassigned patients is not as favorable. So it's not unusual on that, but where we have had in many cases higher volume growth for a hospitalist service line that requires additional provider compensation, we've been successful in getting additional subsidies to cover that specialty, which does have higher growth rates than compared to the other services. So it's not \u2013 but it's been positive and that can be a challenging specialty from a resource standpoint and cost. And so that's been positive.","Dana Hambly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That make sense. Thanks very much","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one quick one. Late last year, you highlighted Project Horizon as a key driver to help push up EmCare margins. Can you provide an update on that initiative? What's been ruled out, and what is left, and how is your view on that \u2013 or, and your view on how that will help your EBITDA profile of that business going forward?","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Project Horizon was really geared towards engineering the operations at EmCare. And a tremendous amount of work was done over the last three quarters. The value of that is it's really level set the criteria for integration between EmCare and Sheridan, and many of the aspects that were identified as opportunities for efficiency and effectiveness of care delivering are being adopted in the integration initiative that we're going through between Sheridan and EmCare. So much of what we've found during our study is being translated through the integration process.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","And Nick, we do think it will positively impact margins, but we've not been specific. And we're still early in that process, again, still a lot of opportunity, but too early to kind of put out anything specific in terms of an actual range of change in margin.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. No question at this point. I'll hand the call back to Bill Sanger and Randy Owen for any closing remarks.","William A. Sanger - Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and actual results may vary materially.

Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Envision's second quarter earnings call. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.34, adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, and topline revenue of $1.64 billion grew by 21.2%. Envision's results for the quarter reflect the solid performance at EmCare and our legacy AMR operations. These were offset by challenges in certain Rural\/Metro where we need to hire more staff and invest in more training than originally anticipated in order to meet service response time commitments to our customers.","We also experienced a lag in the recognition of cost savings at our Envision health plan contract in Florida. I'll walk through each of these issues and Randy will also discuss their impact on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year.","At EmCare, even with softer Q2 volumes, as experienced by the sector, we continue to see sequential improvements in our KPIs and overall operating performance. When excluding Evolution Health's results, EmCare's margins are consistent with last year's second quarter and continue to improve.","As we expected, the impact of contract terminations on revenue growth was lower than in the first quarter, and the impact of prior period terminations should continue to decline throughout the remainder of this year. Our organic and acquisition pipeline continues to remain at historical levels.","At our legacy AMR operations, we continue to generate good results with margins at about 13% for the second quarter. We were able to successfully flex our staffing at legacy AMR during the quarter in response to lower same-market volume growth. We were not able to achieve the same level of efficiency in all markets that were part of the Rural\/Metro acquisition.","At Rural\/Metro, similar to Q1, margins were lower as a result of investments we made in certain markets in order to meet service response time commitments. These investments included additional workforce deployments, training and capital upgrades. Although these investments had an impact on our quarter, our actions have established a solid footing with our communities and our contracting agencies that have been concerned with the operating performance levels under prior ownership.","At Rural\/Metro, we have also accelerated mitigation efforts in underperforming markets, including renegotiations of contractual operating specifications. In addition, we are transitioning some markets, including selling certain assets and closing business units that don't meet our financial or strategic criteria.","While we had some initial delay in the integration of Rural\/Metro, more recently, we have accelerated our timetable. To-date, we have stabilized certain markets, began standardizing many of our processes including conversion of the billing and revenue cycles to our system and combining operations in many of our overlapping markets.","We fully expect these efforts combined with our market integration activity will result in improved operating and financial performance for Rural\/Metro during the second half of this year. It is important to remember that a few key markets account for the majority of Rural\/Metro's revenue and EBITDA; most of these markets are performing to expectations.","Moving on to Evolution Health; we continue to generate strong revenue growth from several sources including health plan contracts and our relationship with Ascension Health which is performing to plan.","However, the EBITDA contribution from Florida health plan is below our expected financial performance through the first half of the year. This is largely a function of a lag between our demonstrated improvements in clinical utilization and outcomes and the actual utilization \u2013 actuary realization of those savings.","Through the first half 2016 we recorded medical claim cost based on historical experience with that population. At the same time, we are experiencing a reduction in medical reutilization and claims cost. As these claims fully mature over the next few months and we are able to validate them actuarially, we expect to realize the savings.","Lastly at Evolution, we are also in final negotiations with a large health plan in the western part of U.S. to manage high-risk patients. This agreement will be on a fee-for-service basis with gain sharing. We are also in discussions with several health systems to manage distinct post acute care population including transportation. Our experience with the Florida health plan has generated intense interest amongst numerous payers; we are excited about our ability to continue to grow this business.","At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Randy for the specifics relative to our financial results for the quarter and our updated 2016 outlook. Randy?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon everyone. I'll quickly walk you through our financial results for the second quarter as well as our revised outlook for 2016. In the second quarter revenue of Envision was $1.64 billion which grew by 21.2% from the prior-year. Income from operations was $88.8 million or 5.4% of revenue. Income from operations declined from the prior year due to higher depreciation and amortization expense and transaction and restructuring costs primarily related to acquisitions in the last year.","Net income was $28.4 million in the quarter compared to $52.4 million in Q2 last year. It was impacted by changes in operating income as well as higher interest expense related to fourth quarter 2015 borrowings to fund acquisitions. Fully diluted GAAP EPS was $0.15 compared GAAP EPS of $0.27 for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.34 compared to $0.37 for Q2 of 2015.","Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million was 5.7% higher year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5% was 150 basis points lower than the prior-year period primarily due to the impact of Rural\/Metro acquisition and Evolution's health plan contract in Florida. EmCare's total revenue was $1.05 billion, an increase of 13.1%, which is comprised of 7.2% growth related to our hospital-based physician services and 102.6% increase for our post acute services through Evolution Health. Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months contributed 8.5% to revenue growth while organic growth was 4.6%. Organic revenue growth in the quarter consisted entirely of same store growth. Revenue from net new contracts was flat year-over-year.","Same-store revenue growth was 5.3% when calculated on a comparable same contract base to last year. Rate grew by 4.4%, including a 2.3% increase from hospital-based services, a 2.1% impact from Evolution Health, and volume grew by 0.9%. Same-store volume growth at EmCare's largest service line, emergency services, was 1.4%, which was lower than our initial expectations but consistent with sector trends in the quarter.","Same-store volume growth was a little higher for hospitals and radiology service lines and a little lower on anesthesia services. When excluding the impact of Evolution Health, same-store revenue per visit on hospital-based services increased, as I mentioned, by 2.3%. This was driven by improvements in anesthesia yields from changes to the revenue cycle process that we've discussed on prior calls. The rate for emergency services was comparable to the rate in Q2 2015.","Payer mix on existing contracts has not changed significantly. Overall, Medicare and Medicaid mix has increased slightly and commercial has decreased slightly, but primarily due to the impact of contract mix changes and the impact of acquisitions on the overall mix. Net new business growth was flat in the quarter. Evolution Health added 4.6% in net new contract growth from the expansion of our Ascension joint venture and the new Florida health plan contract offset by a reduction in EmCare net new hospital-based contracts.","EmCare's revenue from net new hospital-based contracts declined by 3% from the conversion of the Baylor contract to an MSA agreement in Q1 of 2016 as we discussed in our first quarter call. Net new contracts declined by 1.6%, which consisted of new contracts adding 7.3% in growth offset by terminations of 8.9%. As we discussed last quarter, the higher level of terminations was driven by our focused effort to exit underperforming contracts in 2015.","The Q2 termination impact of 8.9% was lower than the 10.3% impact in Q1. And as we progress throughout the year, we expect negative revenue impact from terminations will be reduced, returning to positive net new sales growth by the end of this year. New contract adds will also enhance overall margins compared to contracts that we terminate. EmCare's income from operations was $66.3 million, or 6.3% of revenue, in comparison to $77.9 million or 8.4% of revenue. Income from operations was impacted by lower operating income contribution from Evolution Health and restructuring costs related to EmCare's Project Horizon program for process improvements initiated in late 2015.","Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $103.8 million, or 9.9% of segment revenue, and includes an EBITDA loss of $1.3 million at our Evolution post-acute services business. When excluding Evolution Health, EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was $105.1 million, or 11.3% of revenue. Compensation as a percent of net revenue increased slightly over the prior year quarter, primarily due to coverage increases and higher volumes at hospitals contracts and revenue-based compensation plans at certain ED contracts. Insurance as a percent of net revenue was lower due to favorable trends in current year claims and a $4.1 million favorable prior year development impact, which compares to a $0.6 million unfavorable impact in Q2 of 2015.","Evolution Health generated second quarter revenue of $116.2 million, which is up 102.6% from the prior year. And as I noted, we had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.3 million for the quarter, driven by new health plan contract that we started in Florida late last year.","While we've seen increasingly positive clinical trends including lower readmission rates and lower ED visits from the population we manage, we've not had enough time from an actuarial perspective to record any changes to claim payment trends resulting from our clinical efforts. We anticipate being able to better reflect the impact of our clinical efforts later this year as we have more maturity on claim payments.","AMR's revenue grew by 38.9% to $590.4 million, and revenue growth was driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions completed in the last year, principally Rural\/Metro, which was 34.7%. Organic revenue grew by 4.2%. Revenue growth from net new contracts was 1.6% for the quarter. Same-market growth was 2.6% and entirely attributable to volume increases, as the rate was unchanged from the prior year period.","AMR payer mix did not change significantly compared to Q2 of 2015. We saw a slight decrease in Medicare and a slight increase in Medicaid mix, primarily as a result of different payer mix for Rural\/Metro markets. Income from operations was $22.5 million, or 3.8% of revenue and this compares with $36.4 million or 8.6% of revenue.","Operating margins were driven by lower adjusted EBITDA margins as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense and transaction costs, primarily attributable to the integration of Rural\/Metro. AMR's adjusted EBITDA of $68.2 million grew by 18.4% and the margin was 11.5%.","A 200 basis point margin decline year-over-year is due to the impact of Rural\/Metro, which had a 6.4% margin in the quarter. AMR's legacy business was solid at 13.1% when excluding the impact of Rural\/Metro. AMR's results for the quarter were impacted by softer volumes and additional costs in certain Rural\/Metro markets, which Bill discussed.","We believe this is a timing issue and that our mitigation and integration efforts will lead to improved financial performance in the latter part of 2016 and we expect to achieve ultimate realization of target contributions from Rural\/Metro during 2017.","For the second quarter of 2016, cash flow from operations was $69.6 million. We had two non-recurring payments in this year's period, and those totaled about $26 million, related to a one-time payment for restructuring charges and payment of an acquisition-related accrual. When excluding those payments, cash flow from operations was $95.6 million. The DSOs for Envision declined by one day sequentially and by four days year-to-date.","Adjusted free cash flow was $62.9 million in the second quarter and free cash flow was impacted by an increase in CapEx of $22.1 million. The increase in CapEx was from anticipated investments in Rural\/Metro markets and other new AMR contracts, including several new contracts with start dates in the third quarter. At June 30 we had cash on hand of $212.7 million, total debt was $3.1 billion and net debt was $2.9 billion.","In our press release this afternoon we updated our outlook for 2016. At this time, we expect to earn adjusted EBITDA of $715 million to $730 million for the year. Our previous outlook for adjusted EBITDA was $725 million to $750 million. This adjustment incorporates our expectations for the timing of operating improvements at Rural\/Metro and the realization of claims expense for Evolution Health.","Given these factors, we assume that adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter will be in a range of approximately 25% to 26% of our adjusted 2016 outlook. We do anticipate sequential improvement in our adjusted EBITDA from Q3 to Q4 2016. We've historically seen significant improvement between Q3 and Q4 each year, but expect a larger improvement in 2016 as a significant part of the Rural\/Metro mitigation and integration efforts started in Q2 and occur in Q3, and we also anticipate having more mature claims data later in the year on the Florida health plan contract.","On a per share basis, we now expect 2016 adjusted EPS to be $1.42 to $1.47, from $1.46 to $1.54. Bill?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Randy. Before we open the call for questions, I want to provide a brief update on the merger of Envision Healthcare and AMSURG Corporation, which was announced in mid-June. We expect to file the preliminary joint proxy statement and prospectus related to the merger with the SEC tomorrow. This will be filed on a new registrant named New Amethyst Corporation for the purposes of the merger. Upon the completion of the merger of New Amethyst, it will be renamed to Envision Healthcare Corporation.","The filing will be available on the investor page of our website investor.evhc.net after it is file. Our enthusiasm for the potential of this proposed deal continues to grow. We feel more certain than ever that the strategic rationale for this transaction is unparalleled. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to deliver comprehensive facility-based healthcare services across multitude of physician service lines.","In addition, medical transportation, ambulatory surgery, and post-acute offerings will provide us with the ability to manage care across a broad continuum creating value for patients, health systems, payers and communities. We've structured this merger in a way that creates a large growth company within the health service sector, one that is expected to have balance sheet flexibility and strong cash flow to execute a growth strategy that would generate value for patients and shareholders of both organizations.","As important, the expected cross-selling opportunities for Sheridan and EmCare are aligned with a growing interest among health systems to develop true partnerships with physician service organizations that can help them more effectively beat the clinical and financial measures that drive outcomes in reimbursement. This is becoming more relevant with the inevitable implementation of MACRA and other value-based reimbursement models.","We believe this opportunity alone creates an organic growth profile for the combined organization that is incrementally higher than the current growth profile of the standalone organizations. We will continue to provide updates during the next several months as this transaction is presented to our shareholders.","In closing, in the past, I've made a point on these calls to acknowledge the efforts of our 50,000-plus members on the Envision team for their contributions to patient care in the communities across this country. Therefore, as (20:19) we have an ambitious strategy that we believe will shape the new healthcare delivery system of the future. I continue to be grateful to the valued and talented workforce for their pursuit of quality patient care.","And with that, operator, I'd like to open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. One moment please for the first question. Our first question is from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. We were just wondering, is there any change in your M&A philosophy heading into the AMSURG merger? And also what has your clients' initial reaction been to the deal?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we do have a pipeline that is in normal course of business that we believe we'll continue to execute. We don't anticipate a lot of acquisition between now and the end of the year. We do have a strong organic pipeline that we'll be executing on. We have had preliminary discussions and we have not heard any negative comments from any of our customers. Frankly, they've been quite positive.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then has there been any BPCI reconciliation yet or any key indicators there you can share? And what does the timing look like there?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's really quite early. And, Nick, we actually walked into this program very cautiously and did not take a lot of the opportunity that could have been out there. As such, we are pretty comfortable that we won't see any negative results of participating. We may see some positive results by the end of this year, but they won't be very large. Yes. Operator?","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of Montreal Merrill Lynch (sic) [Bank of America Merrill Lynch] (22:48). Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to \u2013 the EmCare results in the quarter, it sounds \u2013 I mean, obviously, you had some nice improvements sequentially from a margin perspective, but just want to make sure that as far as the guidance adjustments, there really was no, I guess, EmCare \u2013 so EmCare came in, (23:08) in line with how you were thinking about the progression off of kind of the rebuild of Q3.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. No. Well, Kevin, it's Randy. No, look, EmCare has been performing well and on track and we expect that to continue to be on track. The changes we made on the outlook were really related to, again, sort of the timing impact on Rural\/Metro. And on the Florida Blue contract for Evolution. So it really was limited to those two items.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, as far as AMR goes, I guess it wasn't 100% clear to me. You seem to have, I guess, two issues, one, was a little bit soft volume and difficulty staffing to that. I guess is there something structurally different about your ability to flex with your own medical (23:56) contracts versus EmCare, why was it more difficult to do it there (24:01)?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Kevin, let me give it a shot and clear that up for you. So, look, volumes were softer in the quarter really at both EmCare and AMR. And again, like, we've seen, I think, in a number of other companies that have reported here.","So if you look at the AMR, what we call, legacy sort of operations, we were able to handle that effectively and were able to adjust our staffing, flex with the changes in volumes. And again, as I mentioned, the margins for AMR in the quarter, exclude Rural\/Metro, were 13.1%. So a very solid margin story there on AMR.","The issue, again, as we pointed to was really Rural\/Metro which, as we got into that we had to \u2013 there were more pressures in certain markets than we initially anticipated, more staffing pressures and pressures around response time, and so we needed to increase the cost. You saw some of that in Q1, the margins were around 7%. And so, we still had to \u2013 so while volumes were softer, because of the pressures we had on response times, we did not flex as much as we did on AMR in some of those markets to ensure that we met sort of the customer commitment.","So \u2013 but we still think, long-term, obviously, as we integrate the market, get them on to our systems, and a lot of that is happening this year, in the next few months, we will be able to get more efficiencies out of that and still meet the full commitments to the customers. So did that help Kevin?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, the question is, is it contractual or is it operational is the issue?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Well \u2013 no, it's some of both. So one is contractual, right? There were some other contractual arrangements that we had to deal with as we got into that. But also there was a shortage of staffing. So we spent a lot of time and effort hiring new medics. We had a lot of training costs, some in the first quarter and in the second quarter. So we did have additional costs to ensure that we have that.","Now, that we have more of a stable workforce and as we get them on to sort of our deployment platforms, we can get some of the efficiencies that we anticipated in those markets. And again, it wasn't across the whole book of business, right? It was really concentrated in probably half dozen markets that were the most challenging for us.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. So you can fix this without contractual changes or is this going to be fixed by rolling out your infrastructure?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there are some, there are some that we're trying to work with communities to make some adjustments to the way some of the contractual accounts are (26:44) so that we can meet their needs and also operate more effectively. So there is some of that, but a lot of that we can do ourselves.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from A. J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Hi, everybody. Just to make sure I understand the aspect on Rural\/Metro. So it sounds like they have committed to response times that at least the way they were configured it was hard for them to meet. Are those response times that they've committed to generally similar to the response times that you guys do in legacy AMR contracts. And I think you said maybe that you are looking at a couple of markets or some markets that you might actually exit or maybe it's just the restructuring you're talking about. I'm just trying to understand how easy that is to address and how significant part of the problem that was?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Sure. A. J., this is Randy again. So, look, the response times in the communities are consistent with response times at AMR and the industry. They're not dramatically \u2013 there may be nuances that are different but they \u2013 but they were in a difficult spot in terms of not always being compliant and there were concerns in the communities about compliance from the prior operations. And so we made sure that when we went in that we stabilize that. And that took some additional cost and effort and we had to recruit quite a few medics that they were short on and took a period of time to do that and training and over time etcetera.","So it did impact that. That's why A. J. we think primarily this is a timing difference. As we stabilize that, and as we integrate those markets, we can then be more efficient. But the requirements are, I would say, sort of industry comparable measures.","We are, as a part of this mitigation effort and integration effort, looking at certain markets that we may exit, and some of those we have done. So there are probably seven or eight smaller markets that we have looked at and some we've taken action on and may take action on and we're still looking at that.","But, as Bill noted, the important part of Rural \u2013 at least from our confidence in the long-term contribution of Rural is that, a majority of their revenue stream and earnings were from really key markets in States and those were not ones that were the big part of the challenge.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A. J., one of the things to keep in mind is that, when we talk about exiting markets, the exit will generally be accretive to EBITDA, and these are markets that are not really strategic to us as it relates to the overall Envision market-centric strategy.","I think another factor that's important to note is that, many of their 911s are just on the very edge of non-compliance, and one of our initiatives was to ensure that we met compliance at the standards at which the contract entity (29:54) was looking for. And so we did make an initial investment. That will pay off over time.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We believe that this will come back to us; and more importantly, allows us an opportunity to go back and negotiate some operating standards and specifications that will result in better profitability of those contracts.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. As my follow-up, I want to just ask you about the situation with Florida Blue. It sounds like there is an actuarial review and you have to be able to demonstrate to the actuary or through the actuarial process that you've realized certain savings threshold. Is that a third-party actuary or is it their actuary? And how often do they look at it? And is this sort of the first time they've looked at it? And that's taking some time or is it just \u2013 as you ramp up, it just hasn't hit yet what your savings are?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. A.J., again, this is Randy. So, look, we use \u2013 we have an internal actuary and we also use a third party. It's not Florida Blue's actuary, it's our own external actuary that we also use to help us with that. So, one, that's really done monthly. So every month we look at that and we look at what the claims trend has been.","Look, the reality is, is that when you look at claim payments and how long it takes to get those through \u2013 it takes several months maybe to get sort of the majority of that, and then you have others that will trail for several months further.","And so when you look at historical trends, you have \u2013 actuaries will have an IBNR that they have to maintain until you have enough maturity in claim lag to be able to \u2013 for sure, actuarially, be able to show those reductions. And so, a lot of the effort in the first two months or three months of the contract was really engaging patients and really getting them to contact us and to use us to affect some of that treatment.","And so, when we look at metrics, every month we have key metrics that we look at, we see improvements; and as I mentioned, readmissions, ER, other metrics around the population that we're managing. And it's just \u2013 it's taking a longer time actuarially to be able to show that and that's why we \u2013 unfortunately, it's not been as soon as we originally had hoped. But we think the metrics will prove themselves out. And as we go through the next few months you'll get more of that maturity that will allow us to make hopefully appropriate adjustments to reflect those improvements.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. A. J., keep in mind that when we started latter part of 2015, the first step in achieving the utilization patterns that we see today was go through a process of patient engagement. And that in itself took a couple months, three months to get up and running, to engage these patients and put together those plans for those patients.","So, even though we saw pretty quick results in terms of improving utilization and increasing overall outcomes, it's going to take several months for that to flow through the claims process. But we're confident about the plan, and more importantly, as I mentioned in my presentation, we believe there are other opportunities here yet to come forward.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on A.J.'s question, Randy. As we think about guidance, I mean, you kind of alluded to the fact that volumes were soft. So how should we think about your expectations, in terms of organic growth for both EmCare and AMR that you baked into the numbers? And should we think that you've fully taken out any assumptions for Evolution, revenue recognition related to Florida Blue, as we think about your guidance?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. Brian, we have \u2013 if you look at the \u2013 at our guidance, how we approach that is that we did not assume significant changes in volumes, okay? I mean, you do have seasonal changes, so you do see that sometimes between Q3 and Q4, that's a normal part of this business. So we will have adjusted that accordingly, but not assume that sort of same-store volumes all of a sudden would increase.","So that they would stay a little softer is, I think, what we're seeing in the current trends. We do have \u2013 what is baked into our guidance. And I mentioned \u2013 so Q4, you see more of a \u2013 a little more of a jump in the Q3 to Q4, because we do assume that \u2013 and based on the timing of the Rural efforts that are underway and that we're doing, that we'll see some improvement in the Rural profitability, probably more of that in Q4 than even in Q3. And on the Florida Blue contract, we do assume some improvement in that in Q4, okay? But not sort of a dramatic change that we think would be a big risk item.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then, Bill, as we think about contract wins, we're still lapping obviously the EmCare exits, but where are we in terms of resuming new contract wins on the EmCare side? And also, if you don't mind giving us an update on your previous guidance in term of Evolution's outlook and how much business they can win? Do you still feel good saying that we can double Evolution pretty much every year, given the Florida Blue experience and what you're seeing in your pipeline?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take those two questions. We're very confident that we will replicate, in this 2016, the number of new contracts that we sign that are very similar to our historical, we had anywhere between 80 contracts and 110 contracts. I think we'll come in around that 100 range this year of new contracts signed. We're about halfway through that. Keep in mind that many of the contracts that we have scheduled to sign, which are numerous in the latter part of this year, really don't have any real benefit until they get up and running in 2017. But we're very confident about hitting that 100 mark, 100 new contracts signed, with about half of them yet to come forward.","I'm still very confident and very bullish about the topline growth opportunities for Evolution Health. As we start these new contracts, because they're large and they take time to get patient engagement, it's going to take time to hit profitability targets, but I'm very bullish about topline growth. And as I said in the past, I think there is substantial double-digit growth for the next several years as it relates to Evolution.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks guys.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Tejus Ujjani on for Matt. On the EmCare side, can you comment on what type of multiples you're seeing in this space there, in terms of valuation multiples for targets? And then also, across emergency medicine physician practices, I guess how many targets, or what do you say \u2013 what do you think the real runway is there for growth, given you're not going to be buying small practices?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, there continues to be quite a few opportunities as it relates to M&A on all hospital-based services. We are seeing in that nine to 11 range, I think it's more in that mid-part 10 today. Our focus has always been to larger groups at 1 to 300 (37:45). I would say there is at least half a dozen that I am aware of that are out there that are looking for partnerships. I think this will accelerate as the Feds (37:58) come out the latter part of this week, but the rules relative to MACRA, when these physicians actually read what they have to do relative to integrating of data systems, being able to identify utilization and matches the quality, they're going to find themselves looking for partners that are positioned to do that.","And not unlike those who had the opportunity to listen to Chris Holden's call at AMSURG yesterday, they are moving very aggressively on systems necessary to be successful and value-based and we are also in that arena. And we moved quite a bit because we had to be prepared in order to participate with the Blue Cross contract and also with BCPI.","So we probably are far ahead of a lot of our folks that are in the industry. But we're very confident about our ability to identify and execute not only in the latter part of year, particularly in 2017 on hospital-based physician services.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is form Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Can you help maybe individually quantify the impact of the two issues, Rural and Evolution, on maybe the quarter end guidance just to help sort of quantify for each of those segments?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Ralph, it's Randy. Look, if you look at \u2013 I'll start with Evolution Health. So, look, we won't get into specific contract numbers on this. But, look, I think, if you look at it from a guidance perspective and you look at it before, I think, we've talked about that, we believe that Evolution Health would be closer to a mid-single-digit sort of EBITDA margin business.","I think that this year you're probably going to be more in the low-single digits, okay, just because of the timing issue and challenges around that recognition of what we're starting to see here. So I think that is delayed a bit on that.","So on the Rural\/Metro business, if you look at initially \u2013 I think we talked before in our initial guidance for the year, we thought Rural\/Metro run rate was close to probably the upper 50%s from an EBITDA standpoint and we did about half of the synergies, probably could put us closer to, say, $70 million from a contribution perspective, maybe closer to, a little over $80 million in total.","This year, I would say, we're probably on pace for probably more of mid-50%s run rate. Maybe upper 50%s run rate including synergies. So we are \u2013 given challenges we had in the first half of the year with some improvement, I think we're on that run rate.","Now, again, we've done a lot of analysis and our operating teams have done a lot of work around the mitigation and integration efforts. And so we do think long-term. Again, Rural\/Metro will be what we originally thought it would be, but it's taking longer. So there \u2013 it's the timing and it's probably at least six months, probably longer in terms of seeing some of that than we probably first thought.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just trying to again understand and flush out the Evolution Health delay, because it sounds like \u2013 you're saying you generated the savings and you have sort of a third-party actuary that, I guess, has already conveyed that you've generated the savings or are you waiting for Florida Blue to have their actuary? And I'm just trying to understand the economics of how it all works.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(41:40) want to make sure I confused it. So what we are seeing \u2013 so, one, again, we're doing it based on our internal and our external actuarial estimates based on claim payments and as we see it. What we're seeing and we are seeing metrics. So we are clearly seeing metrics, especially in the last few months and we've seen some reduction in claim payments, on improved utilization, more effective utilization, lowering costs, okay? So these are clear metrics and we're starting to see some of that from a claim payment standpoint.","From an actuarial perspective, okay, until you have a much higher maturity and a much higher percentage of claim payments that have come in, you have to retain an IBNR for obviously total expected claims. And at this point, there hasn't been enough time where that number is still \u2013 there's still an INBR and it's still based on more historical claims and historical costs.","And so it's just \u2013 look, it's taking us longer. We did not probably anticipate how long it would take to really have that enough of a lag to see that change from an actuarial perspective. So that's what we're \u2013 that's where we're right now.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. But just wanted to be clear, is this third-party actuary somebody that's sort of Florida Blue and you guys have brought on to basically run the numbers and ultimately when there is enough clarity or visibility, they're going to determine sort of the payment back to you?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, it goes through. It's our external actuary, sure we have an internal actuary. And it's our external actuary that we use for our accounting purposes to determine what \u2013 obviously what the claims expense trend is and what the IBNR is. So, look, Florida Blue will have their own actuary, I'm sure as well, but it's really our actuary that is doing it and looking at claim payments and when those \u2013 when the IBNR sort of can be reduced based on those trends.","Again, we're starting to see that; we're seeing it from a metric; we're starting to see it from a payment standpoint. And that's why we believe as we get to later in the year, we'll see that.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. Keep in mind that as it relates, there are three actuarial eyes on this project if you will. Blue Cross has their own actuary that they \u2013 obviously their whole department looks at utilization; we have our own. And then we choose a third-party to validate the information that the Blues give to us. The Blues provide us what actual claims they're paying and then we determine the IBNR based on what information they provide us. And that is validated by our internal actuaries and a third-party actuary that we use that has done this for decades.","So even though, we are all agreeing that we're seeing decreases in utilization and improved outcomes, there is going to be a lag period before we can recognize that, because that's when IBNR will be \u2013 will start to come down and a bit closer to what's actually occurring in the actual month activities.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. So Florida (45:09) kicked off I guess on July 1, if I'm not mistaken. So just curious what your original \u2013 initial experiences with that have been. I think you guys in the past have said it might even be, let's say, positive but are you seeing anything come from that in the first month or two months here?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, it's good for providers, it's good for physicians. We're seeing some benefit. Mostly the benefit is the discussions we're having with health plans are much more collegial and much more determined on coming to resolution versus sitting on the opposite sides of the table and arguing about rates; there is a process now to get to the end game. And this is something that we feel very good about we think ultimately will benefit our providers.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just thinking about your revenue and payer breakdown of (46:05) commercial continues to be trending down modestly both year-over-year and sequentially. Maybe just talk about some of the factors playing out there. Thank you.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Look, some of it \u2013 I mean, again, we see some small changes. Again, some of that, if you look at the last year or so was really \u2013 acquisitions do affect that in terms of mix differences. For example, AMR, you have a mix difference on the Rural markets; they're very big in Arizona and they have a higher Medicaid mix. And, of course, Medicaid is a pretty good payer in Arizona. And so it does affect the overall metrics, just as EmCare has in some of the acquisitions.","So when we've looked at it, when you look at individual contracts, you don't see a tremendous amount of change in the mix. Some of that, again, when you look at those overall metrics, is affected by \u2013 so when you add a Florida Blue now to the overall revenue which comes through in fees or higher subsidies, it affects sort of the overall percentages in some of the other payers. So \u2013 but I would say we don't see anything material in terms of a change in sort of that mix that gives us any concern.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. You may ask your question.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you spare a minute just talking about the improvement in anesthesia yield in the quarter? I think you said that this relates to last year's contract issue. Maybe, I'm mistaken. But was this something that's more one-time or recurring in nature?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Last year if you recall we had \u2013 and it was really in the early -started in the early part of 2015 where we had some outsourced billing and had some challenges around that. And so we had changed \u2013 throughout the year we were changing our billing process to other parties. And so we had reduced our revenue rate for anesthesia because of the challenges from that third-party billing company.","And so \u2013 as we said, last year, we always thought that once we got to an appropriate billing provider \u2013 the reimbursement rates were still solid, there hadn't been any change in the macro and we expected to see better yields. And that's what that reference is. So we are seeing improved yields and back to levels that we expected to see last year. So it's really not a one-time, it's more of a run rate. We expect to see better yield on anesthesia because we've addressed that issue that happened back in the early 2015.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So just to be clear this wasn't doing a look back against your collection rates and what you were accruing and saying we were actually collecting X more than we were accruing, we need to...","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","No, no, no. Yeah. No, not at all. No it's actually seeing higher cash, right? An improved cash, improved yield on trips (49:09).","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So really just like your experience now matches (49:15).","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. That's right. That's exactly right.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one other question around the contract termination rate. What was that in the quarter and how do you think that tracks for the second half?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","So if you look at contract terminations, they were 10.3% in the first quarter. Okay? And 8 \u2013 what I'd say, 8. \u2013 I'll find it here. It was just about 8.9% in Q2. So it declined 8.9%. We do think this will continue to go down \u2013 and actually will go down more in the latter part of the year as we lap some of those terminations that really started in Q3 of last year.","So we really do expect to see, one, with Bill's point about the pipeline. Probably if you look at the contract starts that Bill referenced, which we think should be around 100 starts. Again, more than half of that, almost 60% of that's probably in the second half of the year. So when you see that acceleration of contract starts and lapping those others, we actually think, by the end of the year, we would get to sort of a positive net new contract contribution, probably later in the year.","And then, 2017, we should go back to a more normal historical positive contribution from net new sales. It also affects our margins, as you might expect. Once contracts mature \u2013 so a lot of the new contracts will be lower margins initially, so won't be a big contribution to earnings, but obviously a bigger impact to 2017. And new contract margins are always higher than obviously contracts that have been terminated, typically.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Is that what you needed?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Sir, you may ask your question.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the question. Considering your experience now with the Florida contract, Bill you talked about negotiations with a West Coast payer. How is that contract going to be different? And has your experiences in Florida changed the way you look at new contract opportunities for Evolution?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. The Florida contract was our first contract where we basically carved out a set of services that we manage, included the ED, medical transportation, inpatient care and post-acute care; the inpatient care being limited to medical.","What we found is that we were \u2013 we probably too quickly decided to take some risk that would now \u2013 basically we'll be seeing the benefit in the future. Going into the new contracts, now we've got experience and we've learned quite a bit actually, quite a bit. We are going to initially start off as a fee-for-service arrangement and move into gain sharing. Once the population is large enough and we have the experience with that particular plan, then we'll consider some type of carve outs, some type of bundled payment. But we're going to begin all new contracts with a fee-for-service gain sharing approach.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","And how would that change in terms of the drag on margins associated, as those contracts ramp up?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, what would happen is, unlike what we've seen in Florida where we did have that drag, where it took us a while to begin to experience the changes in claims, and we're at risk of some degree for that; we would get fee-for-service, we'd be paid for the activity that we are doing as we began to see changes in utilization.","So they would pass fee-for-service for our services, and any changes in utilization, changes in contract or claims cost, we would share that with the health plan. Ultimately, what would happen is, part of our fee-for-service would be taken out of that, and what would be left over, based on the reduction of overall medical claims, would be shared.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","And Richard, there would be \u2013 so you wouldn't have a lag from the fee-for-service standpoint, you'd have positive margins from a fee-for-service perspective. If you looked at then upside from a gain sharing, you would have a lag, right, just in terms of, once you saw the effects and all that stuff. So it would be different, in that I think you would have better initial margins and then, obviously, we would expect upside. But there would be a lag on that.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A couple of questions. Just going back to Rural\/Metro for a moment, I'm not sure I totally understood, just on the volumes being a little lower than expected. Is that in the IFT volumes, or would there be some reason why that'd be on the 911 volumes?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Gary, it was a little bit \u2013 there was some in both, but it was more on the IFT side, okay, of that, in those markets. And I think, look, some of that was in terms of their expectations and looking at history and looking at those markets, and we've just seen where that was a little softer.","We saw some of that in Q1, but some of that was offset by a more intense sort of flu season in the last couple months of Q1. So that sort of offset some of that. So there was some 911 less than we thought, and whether that was a planning issue, more of that was in the IFT.","And so what we've done is, we've worked \u2013 part of this is working very hard to make sure that the communities \u2013 we're responsive to the communities' needs and that we are providing a better service level and better response. Obviously, we believe that also then helps us with gaining additional business and being able to attract other non-emergency business in those communities.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. A couple of your competitors have mentioned some of the exchange plans in Florida lately rather arbitrarily paying some lower rates on ER professional fees. Have you guys seen anything measurable to that effect?","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Nothing. Gary, it's Randy. Look, nothing big that's sort of been brought to our attention. Look, from time to time, we do have plans that will change payments and lower payments, and then that typically then starts a process here of negotiation. But exchanges are pretty small percentage of our mix, and nothing really came to our attention on that. I'll do some checking on that, but there's nothing that's significant. Otherwise it would have come to our attention.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Total Evolution, I think, you said was $1.3 million EBITDA loss. Did you give us total Evolution revenue? Maybe I missed that.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Yeah. I did. It was \u2013 hold on, Gary, it was $116 million.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","For the quarter.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you don't want to give us on the Florida contract, even just the revenue number on that at this point?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm trying to think that through (57:25) It was roughly...","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","Generally, we don't give out specifics of our contracts.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","But for this first...","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, revenue we talk about, that we thought Florida Blue was going to be about 100 \u2013 a little over $100 million of revenue a year. So it's probably \u2013 it's roughly $30 million of revenue out of that. The bigger part is really the Ascension joint venture which has really continued to grow and increase.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Last question. When you talk about some of the services on the Florida Blue contract, and obviously, this is the first one where you're taking risk in this sort of fashion. You talked about some of the services. I guess, to the extent you've been in the market, it would seem like you'd have a really good line of sight on per capita, emergency department, medical transport, utilization, if you've got hospitalists in the market. It seems like you'd have a really good line of sight on where inpatient medical and post-acute trends are.","I think there's a lot of logic around hospitalists having a role in abating the costs on the post-acute side. But could you talk about those other services: ED, medical transport, inpatient medical. Outside of being in a good position to know where the underlying per capita costs are, what are some of the strategies on those services to do some trend-bending, if you will?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. This is Bill, Gary. It's all about patient engagement, the higher engagement you have particularly with the high utilizers. This population is no different than the rest of Managed Care population or health plan population. And that they all appreciate (59:07) the 20% of the population consumes 80% of resources. Our focus of the 60,000 patients is really on about 2,700 patients that consume 70-some-odd-percent of the resources.","First thing we do is we entertain patient engagements, where we'll actually visit the patient and explain to them their condition and how they best can manage their condition with our help. There \u2013 the clich\u00e9 of just telling the patient they have to do better doesn't work. We actually engage these patients several times a week. We are \u2013 before they go to the ER, before they call an ambulance, before they go to the hospital, they call us first and runs through our medical command center of which we utilize telehealth, telemedicine, and we have physicians, pharmacists, nurses interact with the patient.","The majority of the time we're able to manage that patient via the medical command center. Where we feel the patient needs an intervention we have boots on the ground that will basically visit that patient. So actually a trip to the ED, a trip to urgent care center, or a trip to the hospital is the last resort if we don't believe we can manage that patient in a home environment. That's how we're really able to engage and lower the utilization.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's really helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, this will be our last question and it's from Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a quick question on volumes and maybe some of the challenges in the market specifically on the EmCare side. So you talked about softer volumes and not really expecting a dramatic change in the current trends in the second half, so just wondering what some of the specific drivers of that softness are in your view, and maybe as it compares to historical trends? And then, maybe as a follow-up to that, as it relates to rate, it was certainly pretty strong in the second quarter. I wonder if you expect that to continue through the back half and maybe into 2017. Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Operating Officer","This is Randy. Well, first (01:01:16) look, I do think some of that will continue. As I mentioned earlier, anesthesia improvement was a driver there and then that's a recurring improvement, will lap the bigger change from 2015 obviously at some point here.","But we've said before that we think we're sort of in more of a low single-digit sort of rate environment, if you look at it from that perspective. And so that's kind of how we think about, at least in the near term rate.","I do think \u2013 obviously Q3 there was a significant change in the industry not just for us in terms of volumes when you look at Q3 last year. So volumes may look more comparable in terms of quarter-over-quarter when you get to Q3, because there were a lot of change in the same-store volumes compared to the first two quarters of 2015 when you got into the last half of the year. But our volumes were about 1%, same-store volumes were about 1%. Again, it's against a higher comp, but \u2013 look, I don't have anything specific. We've just generally seen a little softer volume. We see that from time to time. Some years it's a little heavier and sometimes it's a little lower. It's clearly on the low end of what we have seen historically.","So it wouldn't surprise me to see a higher number in Q3 only because last year there was a bigger change. But we sort of assume that when you look at volumes per day in our contracts that a lot of that will sort of continue at the current pace. You'll see some seasonality change as you get to the end of the year as we typically do, but I don't have anything specific around volume changes.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay.

You may begin.","Craig Wilson","Thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Envision Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call and introduce our speakers; Bill Sanger, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued today along with our remarks today are made as of today, August 6, 2014 and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold. Today\u2019s remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.evhc.net. All comparisons including our presentation today are for second quarter 2014 to second quarter 2013 unless otherwise noted.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Bill Sanger.","William A. Sanger","Thank you, Craig, and good afternoon to everyone. Q2 was another successful quarter for Envision Healthcare. Revenue was up 19.6%, adjusted EBITDA up 26.6% and adjusted EPS was $0.28. The overall majority of our growth continues to be organic, which we believe to be the result of our integrated service offerings across all business segments. 60% of our revenue growth was driven by net new contract wins, 25% from same store and 15% from acquisitions. ","EmCare\u2019s net new contract wins continued at a record pace and contributed 15.4% to the overall revenue growth of 21.2%. AMR delivered its strongest performance in many years with 16.7% revenue and 33.1% EBITDA growth. EmCare\u2019s second quarter revenue growth of 21.2% was primarily driven by 20.3% organic growth of which 50.4% was from net new contract wins, same-store contract growth increased substantially from Q1 and from prior year, partially driven by the benefits of healthcare reform.","New starts in the quarter are projected to drive approximately $85 million of annualized net new revenue. When combined with the starts of Q1, our first six months of new contract wins are expected to produce approximately 200 million of annualized new revenues.","Late in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Phoenix Physicians which is expected to add an estimate of $125 million in annualized revenues in approximately 800,000 patient encounters. This acquisition expands our presence in South Florida, adds new service offerings and further advances our market-centric strategy.","The acquisition also brought us two new service lines; pediatric and OB\/GYN hospitals which we see as an additional platform for growth. The acquisition provides us substantial opportunity to cross sell our integrated service offerings to these new hospital clients and likewise to cross sell new services to our current and our future hospital partners.","On the innovation front, EmCare continues to be a market leader. We recently added a new offering to our suite of technology solutions. This offering, which we refer to as DASH, Direct Admit System for Hospitals, and further extends our integrated model into the community physician\u2019s office.","This innovation utilizes proprietary software that improves coordination of care between our hospitalist and community physicians by streamlining the hospital direct admission process. Currently, there are a dozen hospitals and 650 community providers utilizing our system. We believe that as we expand this technology we will further solidify our existing relationships, facilitate our organic growth and provide a platform for further integration with AMR and Evolution Health.","At AMR, net revenue growth of 16.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth was 33.1%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by new contract wins and same market increases which was partially driven by the positive aspects of healthcare reform. We are benefiting from our large 911 contract wins in 2013 as well as wins in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to be successful with our IFT and managed transportation businesses. This is the result of improved sales approach in targeted markets, better our time performance for ambulance transports and new managed transportation agreement wins.","At AMR, we had a 150 basis point improvement in operating margins from leveraging our high revenue base, market rationalizations and our investments in technology. Our technology investments while not yet fully implemented have resulted in more effective crew scheduling and deployment. We\u2019re very encouraged by their exceptional results at AMR and believe our improved win rates, our market-centric strategy and acquisition pipeline will enhance our growth and further solidify us as the market leader.","On the Evolution front, we continue to push forward with health plans and health shift in collaboration. We have begun implementing services with Fundamental in the initial target markets. As a reminder, Evolution Health entered into a national agreement with Fundamental to provide post-acute care services throughout their organization. We have also entered into a post-acute pilot with hospital systems in Texas and California as well as a pilot in Nevada with a major health plan. We are confident these pilots will result in long-term relationships with health systems and health plans and provide a basis for further expansion of the program.","Recently Evolution Health was awarded six projects by CMS for their bundled payment care improvement initiative. Under these programs, Evolution Health will provide post-acute comprehensive care to certain Medicare patients beginning January 2015. We believe these programs will provide Evolution Health the opportunity to be a proactive participant in the formation of post-acute care bundling and risk adjusted reimbursement methodologies.","I would now like to comment on the outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the traction we are seeing with our net new contract wins, our robust organic and acquisition pipeline complemented by early benefits of healthcare reform, we are increasing our annual guidance of which Randy will provide more details.","Before I turn the call over to Randy, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 33,000 team members and affiliate clinicians for their constant commitment to our patients, our partner hospitals and fellow colleagues. Without the teams\u2019 tireless efforts, these extraordinary results would never be possible. Thank you.","Randy G. Owen","Thank you, Bill. As highlighted in the earnings release we just posted, our net revenue for the second quarter was 1.08 billion, a 19.6% increase driven by a 21.2% increase at EmCare and a 16.7% increase at AMR. As noted, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 134.2 million, an increase of 26.6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.5%, an increase of 70 basis points.","We reported a net loss for the quarter of 2 million compared to net income of 9.6 million in 2013. The reduction in net income was primarily attributable to a 66.4 million pre-tax charge related to the early debt extinguishment in June 2014 offset by lower interest expense from debt retirements in 2013. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 and GAAP diluted EPS was a negative $0.01.","EmCare net revenue was 690 million in the quarter and increased 21.2%. Of that increase, 73% came from net new contract wins, 23% came from same store and the remainder came from acquisitions. In addition to record setting net new contract wins, we saw a significant increase in our same-store growth driven by additional ED volumes.","On a same-store basis, the year-over-year revenue increased 5.5% from an increase in weighted patient encounters of 5.3%. For ED and hospitalist services, volume increases in Medicaid expansion states were 5.6% compared with volume increases in non-Medicaid expansion states of 4.1%.","Total EmCare self-pay volume mix dropped 200 basis points in the first half of the year from 20.1% at the end of last year to 18.1% in Q2, a further reduction in self-pay of 40 basis points from Q1. We believe this highlights the continuing payer mix shift and increased utilization of previously uninsured patients.","Within Medicaid expansion states, self-pay mix was 400 basis points lower in the second quarter '14 compared to year end 2013, and a further reduction in self-pay of 160 basis points from the first quarter. We saw a corresponding increase in Medicaid and Medicaid HMO mix. In EmCare, almost 50% of our volume is in Texas and Florida, which at this time have not expanded the Medicaid program.","The overall health reform impact is not as significant as it may be in the future if those states provide some expansion or make a change to their Medicaid program. The contract growth in the last year in non-expansion states like Texas and Florida, approximately 23% of our current volume is in Medicaid expansion states.","From a rate perspective, ED net revenue per visit increased 2.9% in the quarter due to the impact of changes in payer mix and rate increases. This was primarily offset by lower revenue per encounter in other service lines which included changes in one of our anesthesia MSA contracts, lower Medicare census at Evolution Health and the startup of the UHS joint venture.","Total revenue related to health reform, payer mix changes and parity was 9.7 million in the quarter. This included parity revenue of 7.3 million. Year-to-date, revenue from changes and parity was approximately $18 million.","EmCare adjusted EBITDA increased 23.4% to 87.1 million with an EBITDA margin improvement of 20 basis points to 12.6%. This includes 1.5 million in acquisition costs primarily for the recent Phoenix Physicians acquisition in June. This margin difference is largely due to improvements in our operating, insurance and general administrative costs offset by increased compensation costs as a percent of net revenue.","While margins improved, our compensation costs were higher as a percent of net revenue due to an 80 basis point increase in start-up costs from a 200% increase in revenue from new contract wins over the last year. Start-up costs in Q2 were 20 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. We have seen success in lowering our start-up costs and expect to see this continue on a per contract basis over time. ","To put these into perspective, expenses that we incur to start up a new contract represent approximately a half turn of EBITDA for each contract starts, which we believe is an effective investment for obtaining new contracts. On a same contract basis, the increase in volume and the rate have led to an improvement in margins of 230 basis points year-over-year.","AMR net revenue was 385.3 million, an increase of 16.7%. Of that increase, organic revenue was 57% from contract wins in the same market increases and 43% came from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by a 5% increase in net new contract wins and a 4.6% increase in existing market revenue.","In existing markets, our weighted volume increased by 3.6% and revenue per transport increased by 1%. Same market volume increases in Medicaid expansion states were 4.4% and 1.5% in non-expansion states. The increase in revenue per trip was primarily driven by an improvement in payer mix as a result of lower self-pay and higher Medicaid mix in Medicaid expansion states.","Total AMR self-pay volume mix dropped 250 basis points in the first half of the year from 19.3% at year end to 16.8% in the second quarter of 2014, an additional 30 basis point reduction in self-pay from the first quarter. The reduction in self-pay and Medicaid expansion states was approximately 400 basis points with a slightly higher increase in Medicaid and Medicaid HMO mix. The net impact of mix changes in existing markets contributed approximately 3.8 million in additional revenue in the quarter and 6 million year-to-date.","AMR adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 33.1% to 47.1 million. The increase is attributable to a combination of revenue growth and improved efficiencies as highlighted by Bill. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 150 basis points to 12.2%. Compensation and benefits as a percent of net revenue was lower by 250 basis points primarily related to operating efficiencies and the impact of the TMS acquisition as managed transportation expenses are primarily included in operating expense.","When combined together, comp and benefits and operating expenses declined 180 basis points over the second quarter of 2013. Insurance expense was higher as a percent of net revenue due to a 1.2 million in unfavorable prior year insurance development compared to a favorable adjustment of 0.3 million in Q2 of '13.","Cash flow provided by operating activities improved significantly due to improved earnings, reduction in EmCare DSO and lower interest payments. Operating cash flow was 63.7 million in the quarter compared to a 12.7 million outflow last year for a net improvement of 76.4 million.","Accounts receivable increased 22.8 million in the quarter compared to 13.8 million in last year due to the impact of accelerated contract growth. The net cash impact of growth was improved due to a three-day decrease in EmCare DSO in the quarter. During the quarter we saw significant decrease in Medicare enrollment related collection delays on order balances and recent contract starts. July cash was also very positive and we continue to expect a reduction in EmCare DSO throughout the year.","Net cash used in investment activities was 184.6 million compared to 23 million last year and primarily driven by acquisitions of 163.5 million in the quarter. Net cash provided by financing activities was 92.5 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 7.4 million. This net change was primarily due to the bond refinancing in June 2014. Adjusted free cash flow improved by 62.3 million and was 43.5 million in the quarter compared to a cash outflow of 18.8 million last year. ","From our strong results in the first half of the year, our continued growth prospects and benefits from healthcare reform, we are revising our 2014 annual guidance. We expect 2014 adjusted EPS to be a $1.15 to a $1.20, up from our previous guidance of $1.10 to $1.15 and 2014 adjusted EBITDA to be 553 million to 558 million up from our previous guidance of 538 million to 545 million.","Our guidance assumes that healthcare reform benefits continue but we\u2019ve not assumed that volumes we saw in the quarter will continue at the same level or mix will change significantly as we\u2019re unable to predict those trends at this time. Our previous guidance assumes some level of acquisition activity in 2014 and the net impact of recently completed acquisitions is included in our guidance with a larger benefit expected in 2015. Bill?","William A. Sanger","Thank you, Randy. Operator, we\u2019d now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). First question; Andrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just talking a little bit more on the reform benefit here, I\u2019m just doing some back of the envelope math. It sounds like if you were running about 20% uninsured volume on an expansion basis, down 400 basis points if that\u2019s correct, so you\u2019re assuming about a 25% decline. Obviously, a still strong number but a little bit lower than what we\u2019ve been saying from maybe some of the hospitals. Can you maybe talk about the trends you\u2019re seeing in those expansion states? And also incorporate in that anything you\u2019re seeing on the exchange side of things?","William A. Sanger","Andrew, it\u2019s hard to compare it specifically with what the hospital is showing. Obviously we have been seeing each month a continuing change in that mix. So as I mentioned, the change in sales price mix in Q2 was even more than what we saw in the initial quarter. Look, I would expect that would continue. Some of that is dependent on utilization and in some cases people understanding what coverage they have and utilizing those services. On the exchange side, we have some data. I think it\u2019s limited at this time. We have been seeing some improved volumes. So, for example, in May based on what we could track, we had about 0.5% of our volume that we saw was from exchanges. That\u2019s increased to 1% in June. So while we\u2019ve not made any major assumptions here, we are seeing some increasing trends in the non-expansion states as well.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just maybe following up on that, on the volume side in general, is there any way to narrow and identify what increased volumes maybe attributed to Medicaid specifically and more specifically any guess on how many of them were previously uninsured utilizing more, entering the system more versus just a mix shift or overall just greater utilization? Thanks.","William A. Sanger","Well, I think Andrew it\u2019s hard to maybe as specific as what you\u2019re asking. Clearly if you look at the significant mix shift 400 basis points here and expansion states moving to Medicaid, we believe obviously that the increase in volume is \u2013 health reform is clearly a factor in that increase in volume and we saw more of that increase continuing throughout the second quarter. So, as I said in the talking points, we\u2019ve not really assumed the same level of volume in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve assumed basically about half of the volumes that we saw in the quarter. We\u2019ve used that in terms of our kind of \u2013 coming up with our guidance.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Operator","Next question; Ryan Daniels, William Blair, your line is open.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Yes, guys, thanks for taking the question. Bill, maybe one for you on Evolution. Given the success you\u2019re seeing there with foundation, the new CMS award, and then the new pilots. I\u2019m curious if you could talk a little bit about one, the capacity you have to manage a greater influx of patients. And then number two, if you expand that, will that be something you look to do internally through hiring or is that maybe an area of focus for M&A going forward?","William A. Sanger","Ryan, it will be a combination of M&A and target markets as well as growth internally. There are distinct markets in which we have identified through our relationships with these pilot systems as well as with various health plans. We\u2019ve targeted certain acquisitions in those markets, but we have a very excellent capacity of growing organically for the number of providers we have in these various marketplaces. So you\u2019ll see a combination of both.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay. Perfect. Maybe two reform-related questions and then I\u2019ll hop off. First, you mentioned that a lot of your volumes in EmCare in particular are in non-expansion states like Texas and Florida at present. I\u2019m curious if you have any thoughts on the potential for those two actually see this Medicaid expansion after the election cycle, number one?","William A. Sanger","Let\u2019s answer the first one. We don\u2019t have any first-hand knowledge. We have heard particularly in Florida rumor of discussions occurring relative to the state 2015 looking at some type of Medicaid expansion. I can\u2019t give you specifics of that but I do know that there are a group of Republican states that are giving a serious consideration relative to expanding the Medicaid program.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay. Perfect. And then the second one just on Medicaid parity. There has been a handful of states now that are pushing to move that into 2015. I\u2019m curious; twofold, number one, if you think ED would be included in that and number two, if you\u2019ve done any work to see how much exposure you have to those potential states that are extending it? Thanks, guys.","William A. Sanger","Ryan, we don\u2019t have a lot of data at the moment in terms of what that can mean in those states. And look, I don\u2019t know if that would include ED services. Obviously, we I think with others in the industry through associations are obviously very active in trying to communicate the fact that there\u2019s such a shortage of physicians. People can\u2019t get access unless they utilize those services which is why you\u2019re seeing some of these volume increases. So, I don\u2019t know that we have anything definitive on that.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay. Thanks, again, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Ralph Jacoby, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to maybe delve into the same-store stats on the EmCare side a little bit. The 5.3% volume obviously a strong showing. Within ED it was 4.2 sort of suggesting much higher volume in non-ED. And then similar on the other side, pricing up 0.2 overall with ED up 2.9 suggesting sort of pricing in the non-ED was sort of much lower. So just trying to understand those moving parts and reconcile the volume and the pricing?","Randel G. Owen","Yes. Ralph, let me just kind of go through a couple of those points again because there was a lot of stats that I went through here. When you look at \u2013 overall we had the 5.3% increase in volume, okay, on a same-store basis. When you look at ED and hospitals and that\u2019s really where we obviously anticipated more of those volume changes related to reform, we actually saw higher volume increases in the Medicaid expansion states. That was 5.6%. But we also saw strong volume in the non-Medicaid expansion states. That\u2019s the 4.1%. So we saw strong volumes really across the country in all of our contracts. From a rate perspective, you\u2019re right. We had about 3% on the ED. I mentioned a couple of items that were driving some of the lower yield on some of the other services. Some of that again was a change. We had one of our MSA contracts where the revenue on that is lower this year than it was last year. I think there\u2019s no volume on that. It really goes straight to rate. On the Evolution Health side which obviously is a part of EmCare, there has been more of a focus on looking at sort of managed care and commercial patients as we start thinking about that model. And so we didn\u2019t have as many of the Medicare census which on just a revenue basis is a higher number. And in the third thing I mentioned in the UHS joint venture, remember we just started that and we did start that initially with existing contracts that we had. And so we did go through in lower subsidies in some of those contracts which impacted some of that yield and for example hospitalist and anesthesia. Obviously long term, we\u2019re very excited about the joint venture and new contracts that will be coming. So we feel very good about that.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. And then just back to sort of the reform question and I may have missed this or misunderstood. Did you say the total sort or revenue related to reform and parity was 9.7 million in the quarter and that the parity revenue was 7.3?","William A. Sanger","That\u2019s correct. 18 million year-to-date in total.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then so in the quarter that\u2019s 2.4 million from ACA to the revenue line.","William A. Sanger","Yes.","Randel G. Owen","And from EmCare, it\u2019s a little over one. We didn\u2019t see as much I think as others did in the first quarter. We saw some more. Most of that really was obviously in the second quarter when you look at the year-to-date numbers. And given EmCare\u2019s 23% of our volumes in the Medicaid states, we expected a lower number. We\u2019ll see how that goes with the expansion side as we\u2019re just starting to see data of additional utilization in some of those states as well.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","What\u2019s the pass-through or what are you keeping sort of down to the EBITDA line of that revenue versus to the physicians?","William A. Sanger","Ralph, it does vary obviously depending on markets and initial markets. I think we\u2019ve always said that overall on a mature basis, we would expect to retain probably 50%, 60% of that. Some of that we\u2019ll share with our joint venture partners obviously and some of that goes with physicians and sharing with our partners through some subsidy changes as well as the joint venture arrangement. So that\u2019s what I would consider.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then last one, if I could. Just the non-controlling interest line, it looked like it was sort of zeroed out this quarter. Why is that or maybe how do we think about that line item going forward?","Randel G. Owen","Ralph, we\u2019ve talked about that a little bit before is that when you look at the level of activity, the level of start-ups and the level activity in the joint venture \u2013 UHS obviously just started up, so we don\u2019t expect to have any significant profit sharing here especially early on. And even with ACA there\u2019s still a lot of new activity and so with start-up costs they\u2019ll start out as lower margins and tend to balance that out. So I think by the end of the year we could see some number in there. My best estimate at this point it\u2019s hard to say. It could be a few million, but those tend to \u2013 would tend to see that probably later in the year as contracts and starts tend to mature.","Ralph Jacoby - Credit Suisse","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank, your line is open.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. It\u2019s Darren Lehrich from Deutsche. So I wanted to start out with a question here just on the AMR IFT trend, they definitely are looking a lot better. I guess I just want to hear from you, Randy, the numbers again on just same-store related transports and what you\u2019re seeing there? And then I guess just more strategically, Bill, can you just share with us what you think you\u2019re doing any different that\u2019s seeing some of these AMR volume trends start to really improve here?","William A. Sanger","Sure. While Randy is pulling out those numbers, Darren, I\u2019ll\u2026","Randel G. Owen","Well, I\u2019ve got that, Bill, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to you. So, Darren, our total volume on a same market basis was up 3.6%. The other point I have is if you look at it in Medicaid expansion states, our volumes were actually 4.4%, so even higher, but we still saw positive volumes in non-expansion states. That\u2019s was 1.5% and so overall it\u2019s 3.6%. Really growth in both the 911 and in the IFT and I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill to kind of talk about some of those differentials.","William A. Sanger","Yes, as I highlighted we\u2019ve taken a different approach towards the IP market which is very consumer oriented. We\u2019ve substantially through changes in our deployment improved our on-site performance, which is a critical component of IFT contracting. In addition, we\u2019ve changed the scale and scope of our sales team. So I think a combination of those factors has really been beneficial for us in terms of signing some system contracts which has really been the driver for us towards our IFT growth.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just going back to the uninsured numbers. I think you gave us mixed figures so we can probably calculate, but just to confirm. You saw about a 10% reduction overall in uninsured ED visits. Is that the right way to think about it, Randy? And can you just talk a little bit about trending through the quarter, whether that level improved as you went through the quarter?","Randel G. Owen","Yes. I think if you look at overall \u2013 I guess there\u2019s kind of two pieces for that, Darren. So if you look at that in the first half of the year, we\u2019ve gone from \u2013 for all of EmCare, from 20% down to 18%. Let\u2019s call it 10% or 200 basis points. The real difference and then obviously in the first quarter when we measured, it was about 160 basis points change and then that grew to 200. So we are continuing to see some continued movement in the Medicaid side. I think as people kind of realize what they had and utilize kind of those services. The bigger impact when you look at EmCare is really on the Medicaid expansion states. So given that it\u2019s just 23% of our volume today, it\u2019s not as significant when you look at the total. But when you look at those expansion states, I think it\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen or heard from others is that we had a 400 basis point reduction in the Medicaid expansion states. Again, most of that went straight Medicaid or Medicaid HMO. So we\u2019ve definitely seen a much larger reduction in those Medicaid expansion states.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","William A. Sanger","Yes, you bet.","Operator","Next question; Frank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets, your line is open.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon. I was hoping you can provide some commentary on anything you\u2019re seeing in the acuity level of these patients presenting in the ED either in expansion states or non-expansion, whether it\u2019s Medicaid or exchange?","Randel G. Owen","Frank, I don\u2019t have any hard stats here but look in general our acuity levels are a little lower I think as you would anticipate. I think a lot of these as we saw previously even back to Massachusetts and whatnot is that a lot of these are not real true emergencies but utilizing them for primary care because they can\u2019t get access to a physician. So we have seen some lower acuity and obviously that affects the yields some. But I haven\u2019t seen anything for it was materially different.","William A. Sanger","Frank, generally speaking if you look at the Medicaid population compared to the rest of the patients we see, it is a lower acuity because of use of primary care and just because of the expansion, we happen to see an increase in acuity due to the expansion at all.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then I was hoping for maybe just a little bit of color on how you see the future contracts coming up opportunities on the AMR side and do you see any larger deal opportunities on the EmCare side like you did with the Phoenix transaction? Thanks.","William A. Sanger","Sure. Let\u2019s take AMR. First, we\u2019ve continued to grow our IP business through some of the differentiating strategies that I just shared with a question that Darren just asked. As relates to some of the larger 911s, we have signed several smaller 911 contracts and we\u2019re still awaiting two major contracts that we talked about for a while. And I\u2019ll just digress here a moment because I just think it\u2019s important you understand the dynamics of the 911 marketplace. In Buffalo where metro is the incumbent and recently got a 90-day extension as the community and particularly they look at whether or not the change is appropriate at this time. We continue to be confident that there are many agreements out there under our competitors that will go out to bid and will be successful in the future. San Diego, which has been delayed for almost a year now, is really up at the state level. The state of California has essentially taken a very aggressive position in looking at the RFPs particularly those that are being released by cities versus counties and they\u2019re reviewing all city RFPs. So we expect that to take a little time. Along the same lines, we do feel very encouraged that those will come out and we\u2019ll be successful in the future. We\u2019ve also applied for Certificate of Need in the state of Arizona which we believe we\u2019ll hear very soon. The state of Arizona was a very restrictive state and with some of the challenges with our competitors in that state, some of the providers and some of the insurers of assets that go into the state to insure that the 911 transport is intact and that communities will be left in a solid position. As it relates to EmCare, one of our real differentiating factors with EmCare has been our ability to sign national agreements. We have continued to expand our relationship with HCA. There are other systems in the RFP process. We\u2019re part of responding to those RFPs and relatively confident, Frank, that we\u2019ll be successful on those contracts on a go-forward basis.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","And maybe on the acquisition side of EmCare.","William A. Sanger","On EmCare, obviously you announced a sizable acquisition for us. I will say there are several acquisitions that are out there in the marketplace of at least the size of the Phoenix Physicians and we believe that those acquisitions would best be suited under a relationship with EmCare and we\u2019ll continue working through those acquisitions.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Next question; Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies, your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations.","William A. Sanger","Hi, Brian. Thanks.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Bill, just wanted to follow up to those comments you made to Frank\u2019s question. So as we think about the contracting pipeline for EmCare and do you mind just giving us some color on what sizes you\u2019re seeing and then what types of agreements these are? Are these still the ER hospitalist or are these more diversified bundle agreements and are they national in scale or are they more regional?","William A. Sanger","Probably about 34% of our contracts that are in the pipeline are related to cross selling or related to system agreements. We\u2019ve been very successful in signing multiple contracts whether it\u2019s for hospitalist ED or for our new emerging service line which is a combination of surgery, anesthesia and hospitalist. We do sign the single contracts but they\u2019re becoming less and less prevalent and particularly as you look at our pipeline. The majority of those are for multiple bundled services.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Okay. And then Randy, as we think about the guidance, you raised the guidance slightly here for the year. What sort of reform expectations have you baked in for the back half of this year and to the guidance adjustment?","Randel G. Owen","We haven\u2019t I guess given specific numbers here. I guess what I would say is that one, we don\u2019t expect any big change in parity. If you remember initially we had 17 million to 20 million already included in our initial guidance. So we\u2019re seeing numbers that are a little above that but not significantly more. I think from a guidance standpoint, obviously I think \u2013 I believe there\u2019s some conservatism there. Obviously we saw significant volumes in the quarter and we\u2019ve not made the assumption that that\u2019s going to continue at the same rate. It may but that\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to predict at this time. Look, we think there was a pretty solid increase in guidance given kind of where we are in the range and I do think that there is some opportunity to see some additional health reform benefits throughout the year and I think we\u2019ll need a little bit more time on that, especially in some of the exchange or non-expansion states.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Got it. And then last question for me. As we think about the ACA joint venture and the UHS joint venture, I know you said UHS is in very early stages but how penetrated would you say we are now in the HCA book at this point?","William A. Sanger","Probably about 50% on a single service and about 30% on multiple services, so we believe there\u2019s a fair amount of runway left.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","Got it. Thanks guys.","William A. Sanger","Thanks.","Operator","Next question from A.J. Rice, UBS. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Hi. Thanks. First off, I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a lot of opportunities you\u2019re pursuing on the Evolution Health side. I know when we exited the year last year you were running about 110 million annualized run rate. Is it materially different now? And if these opportunities come to fruition, might it be materially different next year? Any sense of where that\u2019s at that you can provide?","William A. Sanger","Yes, it\u2019s too early to provide guidance relative to just Evolution Health and there\u2019s a lot of material change at this point in time. These multiple pilots that we have throughout the country are really a test of our performance. We\u2019re very, very confident based on the patients we\u2019ve seen so far that these would translate into pretty significant contracts over the next 12 months.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay. And then maybe just flush out a little bit further if we could what, Bill, you described as the pediatric or OB\/GYN hospitalist opportunity. Are you focused mainly on the type of (indiscernible) management type of opportunity or we\u2019re seeing some others in the broadly defined space go after or are you looking at something more broad than that?","William A. Sanger","No. We really at this point in time have not really focused on the (indiscernible). When we talk about OB\/GYN and pediatrics, it\u2019s primarily related to the hospitalist non-intensive care space.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Any sense about how big that opportunity will be or what the competitive landscape is if you could share maybe?","William A. Sanger","Yes, I think the competitive landscape is very segmented. It\u2019s too early to say what we believe the expansion opportunity of those two sub specialties of hospitalist will be, but we have been asked historically by many of our clients particularly as it relates to pediatric hospitalist.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","William A. Sanger","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Next question from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. Obviously you guys raised guidance or at least the high end of your range as far as the quarter goes and I think when you provided guidance you had basically just kind of an estimate of what you would look like. So is it right to assume that really coming above the high end of the range is largely the June month came in better or are there any other factors that led to the upside in the quarter?","William A. Sanger","Kevin, I think that\u2019s fair. I mean obviously we saw improving performance throughout the quarter. I think I mentioned even from a volume perspective we continue to see that. So I think that\u2019s fair.","Randel G. Owen","I think we\u2019re also trending improvements in our cost structure particularly at AMR and we continue to see that on a go-forward basis and we believe we\u2019ll continue to see margin improvement at both of the operating divisions.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. When you think about the guidance, it sounds like you\u2019re being conservative I guess. I never felt companies were being conservative on their guidance, but as far as the volumes go, is there a reason to seeing that the volumes really won\u2019t persist at these levels? Any better sense and kind of why the volumes were so weak over the last two quarters and why this was the quarter where it snapped back?","William A. Sanger","Kevin, I guess a couple of things. One, it\u2019s hard to predict and going up there on a limb to assume that things are going to continue at the same rate. So I think that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re seeing a lot of people be conservative until you have more history, right, to your point. Q1 as we all know was challenging for us and for everyone especially on a comp basis given weather and last year\u2019s flu and all that stuff. And it does seem as though it\u2019s taking a little longer when you look at additional volumes at least on the Medicaid side we saw more of that and kind of to your point volumes sort of improving a little bit every month and saw a lot more of that in Q2. And I think we all just want to see a longer period of time before you\u2019re going to commit to that kind of a volume level.","Randel G. Owen","Yes, keep in mind like the rest of the industry these volume trends really only over the last couple three months at most and for us to really call that a trend, we\u2019d like to see at least another quarter. We are somewhat encouraged by the volume increases but cautious to get too aggressive at this point in time.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So this is \u2013 the volume increases obviously it\u2019s better in reform states but it was still pretty strong in the non-reform states. So that has at least signaled that potentially this was something broader based to make sense.","William A. Sanger","Kevin, again, I\u2019ve heard others and I think we\u2019re in the same boat. We felt like it would take longer to get a feel for the exchange side of things just given the late enrollments and all that kind of stuff and what we saw in the Medicaid side. So, I think we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that volumes were really solid across the whole country including those non-expansions and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re probably maybe more telling in the next quarter when you look at sort of those volumes.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I guess, it makes sense to me to say that the ER volumes might be higher in reform states, but I was little surprised that the ambulance volumes were higher. Is there a reason why that would happen? Was it more inter-facility transports that was driving that or I mean I just try to struggle for why ambulance service would go up in an expansion state?","William A. Sanger","It was really both. But keep in mind the IFT is really a function of admission within hospitals. And so with higher admissions, more transports. As more Medicaid patients came into the hospitals, we\u2019re transporting those to different locations. So it\u2019s a combination of both. I think the 911 increases were frankly just a result of the reason and in IFT we may have seen a result of the expansions.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","Gary Taylor, Citi, your line is open.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","William A. Sanger","Hi, Gary.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","A couple of questions. One, Randy, when you broke out the parity and ACA revenue impact in the 2Q and you said 2.4 million for ACA, what exactly are you measuring there? Is that just healthcare exchange revenue?","Randel G. Owen","It\u2019s really Medicaid. When you look at it, it\u2019s really looking and saying what did we see in terms of the reduction in self-pay compared to the increase in Medicaid in terms of volumes and mix and really sort of applying that kind of rate differential is basically what that is.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","So basically it\u2019s a pickup in that Medicaid revenue versus self-pay. I guess the presumption that all of the self-pay movement is attributable to expansion I guess.","Randel G. Owen","Again, we literally just \u2013 we know what we did on the self-pay and obviously looking at that reduction in self-pay and we know what we did obviously on the Medicaid side. So it really is again sort of comparing those two and sort of that rate differential.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","But for that full 200 basis point decline in self-pay, you mentioned that.","Randel G. Owen","Yes.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. And then you commented when you looked at just EmCare and the revenue per visit and you commented on a few things, the UHS JV, the Medicaid census at Evolution. The first time you went through it, I thought you mentioned change and anesthesia and I thought you said MSA contract and I was thinking MSO contract, but\u2026","Randel G. Owen","I guess you can use MSO. If you recall, we\u2019ve had for a period of time a contract with Pinnacle Anesthesia on the MSO side that we had purchased a number of years ago. The group was bought by a third party and so there was sort of a restructuring of that agreement. It\u2019s still in place over the initial term with some restructuring of that and this year they\u2019re just in this period, a lower sort of revenue base on that. But that\u2019s really what I\u2019m referencing there.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay, so it\u2019s kind of a mix thing.","Randel G. Owen","Yes. And there\u2019s no volume on that. It just goes straight to rate basically.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Right, and so now it\u2019s gone, got it. And then Bill, I just wanted to ask you kind of theoretically when you look at EmCare, you guys have been signing new contracts, you\u2019ve been willing to take subsidy out and I guess kind of the market perception is that you\u2019re willing to trade EBITDA margin percentage for gross EBITDA dollars and obviously the market has rewarded you for making that trade. How do you think that impacts EmCare margins longer term? If we look over the last 10 years or so, we\u2019ve seen those margins march 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%, 13% but over the next few years as you continue to kind of cross sell multiple services, is the margin really topped out? Does it come down? Is it still a gross dollar profit play versus margin play or do you think it can be both still?","William A. Sanger","If you look at our margins, they\u2019ve been pretty stable this point in time and frankly the margins that we see through our joint venture in a greater model are consistent with the overall margins. What you\u2019re seeing is a little bit of a compression from our 13% down to 12.8% that really has to do with we\u2019re starting up so many contracts. And as we start these contracts, we\u2019re not buying the group and so we have to reenroll. We have to add new physicians. Some physicians leave and so we\u2019re very confident that we will not see erosion frankly as we stabilize these relationships, I expect EmCare\u2019s margins over time to continue to increase and to get back in that 13% range.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. And then finally, is there any rough guess on what these sort of non-same store contract comprise in terms of how much they\u2019re weighing on the consolidated margins?","William A. Sanger","Gary, I don\u2019t have \u2013 I guess off the top of my head anything in total in terms of you look at that. I know your question is in terms of new contracts what the blended margin is on sort of the new contracts. I\u2019ll tell you and just as a reference point it\u2019s not unusual for us to see \u2013 for example let\u2019s say a mature contract margin is more in that sort of mid teens range to where you may start in the low single digits depending on the hospital having new physicians you have to recruit. But with buyouts and everything you could have that go to a low to mid single digit and it could take six to 12 months to get to that mature margins again depending on the dynamics of that contract. And so that\u2019s what we tried to highlight here was that \u2013 and while we had an increase in that, it\u2019s really just a function of we added so many new contracts. And so we\u2019ve tried to think about it and frame it up as saying when you look at that investment, it\u2019s about a half turn if you think of it in a multiple perspective. So obviously we\u2019re very willing and comfortable doing that. We think that\u2019s a pretty cheap investment to get new contracts.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","William A. Sanger","Thanks.","Operator","Next question from Josh Raskin, Barclays. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Hi. Thanks. I was wondering if I could just start, do you have \u2013 I know they\u2019ll be in the 10-Q but it\u2019s always helpful, the volume, the payer mix for the volumes?","Randel G. Owen","Josh, I don\u2019t have it in front of me in terms of \u2013 you mean in terms of all the different payer classes you mean in terms of maybe the volumes. Yes, I don\u2019t have it. In general what I would tell you is that really about AMR and EmCare if you look especially at the Medicaid expansion states, most of that change, the lowering of self-pay really went straight to Medicaid\/Medicaid HMO. There were some minor changes \u2013 for example, Medicare nothing material. There were some slight increases on the commercial \u2013 again nothing really significant, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot when you go through there. More of it is moving at this point into sort of Medicaid or Medicaid HMO.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. It just sounds like the first quarter for example that self-pay percentage actually didn\u2019t move just because of the mechanics of the number, so just felt we could \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll follow up offline or wait for the Q. And then second question just Medicaid pending, can you remind me what your procedures are around how you\u2019re classifying individuals that show up with no insurance as Medicaid pending. Did you learn anything from the first quarter, i.e., were you being more conservative or more aggressive? Have you figured out sort of where that equilibrium is?","William A. Sanger","Well, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll say there\u2019s any sort of big lessons learnt. I think we talked about \u2013 when we see a patient, if they don\u2019t have Medicaid I\u2019d say at this point we reflect them initially as uninsured. And then obviously once we know whether we have qualified them or the hospital does or whatever and if they are qualified for Medicaid or if there was an exchange or something different, then we would obviously change that financial class once we build the different payer, albeit Medicaid or whatever. So that process I don\u2019t think is that different where in some cases it can happen fairly quick but sometimes it can take, I don\u2019t know, 30 days or whatever. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big change in that process. But it is common to have what we call transfers, if you will, from a payer mix standpoint as you go through it. We did see more transfers in the first half of this year. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a big difference between Q1 and Q2 especially on the Medicaid side just because I think it was \u2013 maybe there\u2019s a little more confusion and people are applying or getting applied Medicaid and probably what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Right. That\u2019s what I was asking. So when you say there were more transfers in payer mix around Medicaid, that means that as you looked back at the first quarter, it turns out individuals you had previously classified as uninsured were now Medicaid or was it the other way around?","William A. Sanger","No, Medicaid. I mean again that always happens. So for example if somebody came in today and did not have a Medicaid card or was not a part of that program, we would initially reflect them as uninsured. And then obviously if were to qualify them or then bill Medicaid whether it\u2019s a week later or a month later, then obviously that would have been changed to a Medicaid and you\u2019d reflect it at that point in time. So that\u2019s always been the case but I would say there has been more volume just because of the change in reform in there.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Right, got you. Okay. And then just last question on the Phoenix acquisition. I know it was only I think a couple weeks in the second quarter. But do you guys have an estimate as to the EBITDA contribution in the second half or should we think of the margins as something lower than EmCare overall or just maybe any parameters for that?","William A. Sanger","Josh, I guess we haven\u2019t put out specific numbers on that. I would say that we expect \u2013 I think that margins today would be a little lower than the EmCare blended margin. From our standpoint, part of that process in the acquisition was a real opportunity around additional services and selling other revenue and there was also some cost synergies and that\u2019s going to take a little while and that\u2019s why we commented that really next year not only you have the full year benefit but I think in this next six months, you\u2019ll be able to work through some of those cost synergies as well as try to enhance some of the revenue opportunities.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. So if I threw in 5 million bucks in the second half, I\u2019d be in the ballpark. Is that fair?","William A. Sanger","That\u2019s probably rational.","Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question; Whit Mayo, Robert Baird, your line is open.","Matthew Gilmore - Robert W. Baird","Hi, thanks. This is actually Matthew Gilmore in for Whit today. Just a few quick ones. First as a follow-up to Ryan\u2019s question from earlier, as you think about the Medicaid expansion beyond this year, and I know you mentioned Florida. There are a couple other states that are also kind on the bubble like Pennsylvania, Indiana and Virginia. So can you just sort of help size up what the exposure is to those states in particular?","William A. Sanger","Well, we have a fair amount of business in Indiana as well as Pennsylvania. I could not tell you exactly what percentage of our business is in there, but I would say that between those two states alone, we probably have 60 contracts and like as I said earlier, there are several Republican states that are really giving serious thought to it. I think Indiana is probably ahead of the curve and many states are really looking at that Indiana program that\u2019s going to be put forth by the governor and should probably serve as a model for any Republican state expansion.","Matthew Gilmore - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks. And then on \u2013 just sort of curious what your view is of the freestanding ED industry. I know that subsector has kind of gotten a lot of attention recently. But just curious, how you see this? Is it a growth opportunity in terms of ER staffing or a potential competition? And any kind of general thoughts would be helpful. Thanks.","William A. Sanger","Sure. I think if you look at freestanding EDs, I have a personal viewpoint on that and I\u2019ll share that with you. There\u2019s right now about 400 to 500 freestanding EDs. About 20% of those frankly are in Houston and about 25% of those are in the state of Texas. Our biggest challenge with freestanding EDs is really competition for (indiscernible) physicians. We really haven\u2019t seen a drop in volume. As you all know, the freestanding EDs do not see a lot of patients and a lot of those are patients that generally would go to an urgent care center because the general population is very confused as to what is the different between a freestanding ED in a strip mall and an urgent care center in a strip mall. And they use them interchangeably. So I do think we\u2019ll see further expansion. I do believe that the majority of expansion we see in the future will be affiliated with hospitals. If you follow the industry, you know there\u2019s a fair amount of legislative action at the state level afoot that try to ensure that these freestanding EDs have the scope and scale of services that their EDs provide at the hospital setting. So I do think you will see more in the future but at this point in time we don\u2019t see them as a major threat to ED volume.","Matthew Gilmore - Robert W. Baird","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I have no further questions.","William A. Sanger","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your support of the company and trust. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the call for today. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time."],"8900":["Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.

Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining this discussion of our 2014 fourth-quarter and full-year results. We are very pleased to report another year of double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We have been successful delivering this performance year after year as a result of our balanced approach to revenue growth, our unique development of new opportunities, and our ability to identify and achieve operating efficiencies.","Our top-line growth continues to be driven by winning new business through our value proposition, supplemented by targeted acquisitions. On the acquisition front, we are seeing more opportunities and anticipate that acquisitions will drive a higher rate of growth for our company than in the past year. For the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 17.6%, while adjusted EBITDA was up 13.6%, resulting in a 160 basis margin expansion year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up by 36.1% at EmCare and at AMR, it grew by 29.2%. For all of our operating segments, revenue growth in 2014 was 18% and was the principal driver of adjusted EBITDA growth which, at $556.2 million, was up 24.8% over 2013.","Revenue growth from net new contracts in 2014 represented more than half of our growth for the year. As I mentioned in past calls, we believe that organic growth is fundamental to our long-term strategy. We also believe that it establishes a compelling value proposition. As encouraging, going into 2015, our organic and acquisition pipeline is at historical high levels.","In fact, on the acquisition front, so far this year, we've announced three large transactions, which combined, have anticipated annual revenues of approximately $435 million. This includes two iconic physician practices and one of the largest physician staffing companies in the country. Two of these transactions have closed, and a third is expected to close shortly. On an annualized basis, we expect the two practices will add more than 1.9 million patient encounters. This is equal to about 13% of EmCare's weighted encounters for all of 2014.","I'd like to take a few minutes now to describe the importance of these acquisitions. You may recall from prior discussions that we believe taking a market-centric approach better positions us to build our market share and market space for our continuum of care services.","Two targeted regions in our plan include Arizona and certain Northeastern U.S. markets. The acquisition of Emergency Medical Associates and Scottsdale Emergency Associates has provided us the opportunity to leverage this relationship of the practices in the markets as well as with other similar groups.","EMA, our new Northeastern partner, brings 580 physicians in 47 facilities, delivering ED, hospitalist and urgent care center services. EMA has been an innovator in both clinical and technology applications to improve patient care, which we believe will further enhance our existing care delivery models. We expect to complete this transaction in the next few days.","SEA, our new Arizona partners in the Scottsdale, Maricopa County area, are considered to be one of the premier independent physician groups in the nation. Its reputation as leaders in physician engagement strategies will significantly benefit our physician retention and recruitment efforts.","We are confident that these transactions position Envision to expand our hospital-based medical transportation and post-acute care services. For example, even though we've just completed the transaction with SEA, our teams are already working together to provide continuum of care services in that region. As important, these two practices, which are leaders amongst the large independent groups, believe that our vision and our business model are best positioned to shape the evolving healthcare landscape.","We also recently announced that we are now one of the largest providers of temporary physician staffing through the acquisition of VISTA Staffing, which we completed earlier this month. This is a great strategic acquisition for several reasons. First, as the fourth-largest physician staffing company, VISTA brings tremendous depth of experience, resources and relationships. VISTA contracts with many hospitals and health systems, much like EmCare, and this provides the opportunity to introduce Envision services to new health system relationships that they've developed as well as vice versa.","There are several other significant benefits of the acquisition as well. I previously mentioned that the majority of costs associated with new contracts starts at temporary staffing. With VISTA, we'll have access to more providers, which will help us to accelerate the launch of new contracts. We also will be able to provide physicians with greater career opportunities to improve our recruitment and retention. Finally, we can benefit from VISTA's vast experience in processes to become more efficient users of contract providers.","On the AMR front, the company continues its positive trajectory with Q4 revenue improvement of 12% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 29.2%. For all of 2014, AMR's net revenue grew by 13.6% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 27.1%. In addition, we've seen improved margins as a result of our technology investments that are yielding ongoing operating efficiencies. We also had 100% renewal on our 911 contracts in 2014, and we are still awaiting on final results on several RFPs.","We recently shared that our application for a certificate of need in the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area was approved. I am pleased to report to you that as of yesterday, we are now providing medical transportation services in that area. This new geographic service area for AMR, combined with our acquisition of SEA, strongly supports our market-centric strategy. In addition to our organic growth, the acquisition pipeline for AMR is robust and we anticipate 2015 will be a acquisitive year.","Moving to Evolution Health, by many means, 2014 marked a year of great accomplishments based on market traction, contract execution and positioning for the future. It was a year of building that provided the framework that enabled us to enter into relationships with major health plans, health systems, and group practices. These included national post-acute care agreements with Ascension Health and Universal Health Services. We also entered in agreements with Aetna for transitional care services and a post-acute care risk-based contract with HealthSpring in the Dallas area.","Some of you may recall that our initial target was a Medicare Advantage population, and although today we are largely fee-for-service, investments in data analytics and infrastructure have positioned us to offer our services to a broader base of patients as well as to participate in value-based reimbursement arrangements.","These investments have also positioned the company under the CMS Bundled Payment for Care Improvement initiative to be one of a limited number of conveners and episode initiator in both models two and three. We are encouraged with our ongoing discussions with providers and payors and believe 2015 will see significant growth in profitability in our post-acute care service line.","Now before turning the call over to Randy, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 34,000 associates for the dedication in making a difference in the lives of the patients we serve. Randy?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill said, we reported another quarter of strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and we continue to see margin expansion in both our operating segments. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.16 billion, an increase of 17.6%.","Revenue growth was driven largely from organic sources as net new contracts and strong same-store revenues for both our EmCare and AMR segments continued to contribute to a majority of the growth. We also continued to generate growth from acquisitions and expect expanded growth from acquisitions in 2015.","As we stated in today's press release, our adjusted EBITDA now excludes transaction costs related to acquisition activities, which is consistent with how the sector treats these costs. We incurred $1.8 million of costs related to our acquisition activities in the fourth quarter, which have been excluded from adjusted EBITDA, and include some costs associated with transactions we announced recently.","Adjusted EBITDA of $156.6 million for the quarter grew by 33.6%, and our margins expanded by 160 basis points to 13.5% as we benefited from significant revenue growth, including the impacts of health reforms and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.36, and fully diluted GAAP EPS was $0.26.","Looking at results from our operating segments, EmCare's revenue of $759.8 million grew by 20.7% for the quarter. Organic revenue growth was 15.5% and includes contributions of 10.2% from net new contracts signed during the past 12 months and a growth of 5.3% from same-store contracts. The remaining 5.2% of growth came from acquisitions.","On a comparable same-store basis, EmCare's revenue growth was 5.9%, which included 5.9% growth from volume and no change in rates overall. Rates did vary slightly by service lines, with the combined increase in rates for our ED and hospitalist services of 2.9%, which was offset by lower anesthesia rates due to the change in a previously discussed anesthesia MSA contract in February 2014.","EmCare's payor mix continued to benefit from health reform. During the fourth quarter, the percentage of EmCare's self-pay volume decreased by 130 basis points overall on a sequential basis. For all of 2014, the decline in self-pay volumes was 440 basis points, with a corresponding increase primarily in the Medicaid managed care plans.","Self-pay volume in states that have expanded Medicaid programs declined by 830 basis points year-over-year, with a decline of 320 basis points from those states that have not expanded Medicaid at this point. Same-store volumes in the fourth quarter were actually higher in the non-expansion states due to higher seasonal flu volumes and the proportion of our services in Texas and Florida.","During the quarter, EmCare's total volume in Medicaid Expansion states did increase slightly from last quarter, and now it's at approximately 25% of total volume. We anticipate that percentage to increase to approximately 30% due to the implementation of State Medicaid reform in Pennsylvania and Indiana.","EmCare's revenue related to health reform in the quarter was $12 million with payor mix changes of about $3 million, while benefits from Medicaid parity contributed about $9 million. During 2014, health reform revenue was about $43 million, and this includes about $10 million from beneficial payor mix shift as well as benefits from parity revenue of about $33 million.","EmCare's adjusted EBITDA of $102.5 million increased 36.1% for the fourth quarter, and margin improved by 150 basis points to 13.5%, driven by lower compensation and benefits expense and lower insurance expense as a percent of revenue. In the quarter, we identified a control weakness in our chart accrual process with an immaterial net negative impact to EBITDA. The process is being remediated and will be noted in our 10-K.","Shifting our results, for AMR, revenue grew by 12% to $398 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 29.2%, as we continue to benefit from our process improvement initiatives. Most of the revenue growth was organic.","Revenue from existing markets increased by 6.6%, while net new contract wins contributed 1.7% growth or combined 8.3% growth from organic sources. Acquisition-related revenue growth contributed 3.7% to quarter-over-year growth.","Payor mix continued to improve at AMR as well. Self-pay declined by 340 basis points during 2014, and incorporates about a 40-basis-point improvement since the end of the third quarter. The mix shift had a $3.7-million benefit to AMR in the fourth quarter. And for all of 2014, it was $13.9 million.","The self-pay reduction was 420 basis points in states that expanded Medicaid and a 130 basis point decline in non-Expansion states. AMR's adjusted EBITDA was $54.1 million or 13.6% of revenue for the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points year-over-year. AMR continues to see improvement in compensation and benefits expense as a percent of net revenue, they improved by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, our operating expense as a percent of revenue were 240 basis points lower and that was driven by a result of several factors, including synergy benefits from acquisitions, operating efficiencies, and lower fuel costs.","Fuel costs in the fourth quarter on a transport-adjusted basis were approximately $1 million lower in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year. As a reminder, our annual fuel costs were approximately $45 million to $50 million. 35% of our fuel spend is for diesel and about 25% of our fuel is hedged at historical rates through 2015.","Envision's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was higher due to the sharing of tax benefits and tax losses of our joint ventures, which was offset by a benefit in our minority interest calculation. Ultimately, this does not affect our consolidated effective tax rate, which was 40.6% in 2014, when excluding this presentation impact. And we anticipate a similar rate in 2015.","Cash flow provided by operating activities improved significantly due to higher earnings, which included the benefit of lower cash interest payments. Cash flow from operations was $80 million in the quarter compared to $28.5 million last year. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $56.2 million compared to $4.6 million last year. For all of 2014, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $223.4 million, up considerably from $48.9 million in 2013.","Looking at our balance sheet, accounts receivable growth of 19% was generally in line with the growth of our business. We saw decreased \u2013 a DSO decrease year-over-year at EmCare. And while AMR DSO increased in the fourth quarter, for factors that we believe are temporary and are mostly related to a transition of some of our billing activities to a third party.","We had cash and equivalents of about $319 million and total debt outstanding was just over $2 billion at December 31. We've since completed two of the three previously announced large transactions and expect that EMA will close during the next several days, funding those through a combination of available cash and amount available under our revolving credit facility. We recently expanded that credit facility to $550 million from $450 million.","In addition, we're in the process of evaluating other financing options, including further revolver expansion and long-term financing. Finally, I want to reaffirm the guidance for 2015, which was issued January 13. We expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $653 million to $665 million during 2015, which implies EBITDA growth of between 17% and 20% over our 2014 results.","We also expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.42 to $1.50. Our assumptions are that we'll drive revenue growth from acquisitions as well as organic growth. Since the beginning of 2015, we have lost Medicaid parity revenue with an 80% margin. We expect to replace the EBITDA impact of loss parity with recent acquisitions at EmCare's traditional margins. This will result in an anticipated reduction in EmCare margins of approximately 80 basis points for 2015.","We also expect that first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be about 19% to 20% of our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance due to the normal payroll tax impact as well as the loss of parity on January 1 and the contributions of acquisitions that will be fully closed in the next few days.","Operator, at this point, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. I just want to see because I guess your guidance for adjusted EBITDA now excludes transaction costs, and wasn't sure if that meant that you were actually changing kind of the underlying view on adjusted EBITDA for 2015.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, Kevin, ultimately, they're not that significant in terms of what we had in the guidance in terms of expected transaction costs. So while it would have a slight positive impact, it's not significant enough to change sort of that guidance at this point.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So your original guidance didn't assume very much. Your new guidance kind of says, hey, there are so many deals. This is going to be a big number. So let's exclude it. Is that the way to think about it?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Look, we made a change, obviously, to be consistent with our peers, who also excluded that as well. So in our initial guidance, obviously, we had some level of acquisition growth, but did not have a material amount of sort of transaction costs. So I don't think it's a big impact at this point.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess, obviously, the EmCare margins have been pressured this year because of some of the new contract starts. Can you talk a little bit about how that margin ramp has happened. I see that you did a nice job sequentially on that, but it wasn't clear how much of that was kind of under the normal fluctuations that you might see from quarter to quarter on insurance costs versus a real improvement in the contract...","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think, there is \u2013 I mean, we believe there is, obviously, real improvement in margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we had better results from our comp and benefits as a percent of revenue. Obviously, revenue growth helped with that. We did see some better experience on the insurance side. So we had a number of areas that we saw improvement, from an operating standpoint.","So some of this \u2013 as you'll recall, margins do increase quarter-over-quarter, and so some of that is normal. And that's why we made the point a minute ago around \u2013 in the first quarter, remember, you start over with payroll taxes, which for us is about $15 million to $20 million more in Q1 than you spend in Q4.","And, obviously, the difference in the margin impact of parity and the margin of the new acquisitions will reduce overall margins next year as well. But rte underlying business is still improving.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","And, Kevin, this is Bill. Good afternoon. I think also, if you recall, our discussion about changing our approach to early starts or quick starts less than 90 days, we've seen that become more and more effective each quarter. We're seeing less and less startup costs on a percentage basis of new starts.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just last question, maybe kind of asked another way. But is there a view about what kind of same-store margins \u2013 it looks like you guys have been very acquisitive? You guys have been growing new contracts very quickly. Is there a view of like, between those two things, I assume, maybe deals coming in at a little bit lower margin as well, like what the delta is between the reported margin and kind of the added revenue?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","In terms of acquisitions of \u2013 you're talking about acquisitions or just new contracts?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I guess, both. I guess kind of think about what a same contract margin might look like versus a combination of new contract growth and acquisitions, assuming acquisitions come in at lower margin; maybe they don't.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, look, overall acquisitions are at a fairly similar margin, so we're not seeing where that has a big impact in the overall margins. Clearly, new contracts do. And we talked about that before where new contracts come in at a much lower margin. And then obviously, you expand as you see maturity in those contracts and those are fully recruited. So, historically, we didn't specifically call out that number. What we traditionally have and continue to see better margins when you look at same-store contracts, just the nature of those that are more mature.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Couple things here, I guess, first of all, it'd be great just to get an update, if we could, on evolution and just sort of at year end, just given all the activity, where you stand with that business, its run rate, and just the flexion (24;24) of the business and the contracts you're carrying into 2015 at this point? And alongside that question, I guess, how much investment will you be spending through the P&L in that business? Said differently, what kind of margin effect do you think it'll have?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Darren. This is Bill. Good afternoon. One of the opportunities that really presented in 2014 really had to do with the acceptance of our transitional care programs. We started with Aetna, and that program now has over 8,000 member lives. We expect that to continue each quarter. There is a pretty significant investment in both technology and also personnel. We also have, under Phase I, a relationship with Cigna HealthSpring. That's about 7500 members in Phase I. We expect that to go to about 20,000 by year-end. Keeping in mind that the investments in technology are pretty well completed relative to our medical command center and future investments really have to do with clinicians in the geographic area in which either the health plan or the hospital system or group practice begins the opportunity.","We also launched most recently a transitional care program through our relationship with UHS. We are talking with other health systems and we believe that probably before year end, we'll bring on two to three additional large health systems.","One of the areas that's getting a tremendous amount of interest from providers as well as health plans has to do with our unplanned or unscheduled care program. We believe that's going to get a lot of traction in 2015. Ascension, which is one of our largest contracts to-date, we actually began that February 1 of this year. We are now very effectively moving towards markets. You may have seen some of the recent statements by Ascension Health that they're pleased with progress to date and we anticipate over a three-year period to have, essentially, canvassed all of the hospital and hospital systems related with Ascension Health.","At this point in time, our emphasis is not only on health plans, we also are looking at the opportunities that are really presenting to us under the bundled payment program. We are both a convener and we believe we will also be an episode initiator; both model 2 and model 3. We are also talking with several states relative to the dual-eligible and believe that very shortly, we'll be chatting more about some of the transitional care programs for the dual-eligible.","So, all in all, it's a mouthful of initiatives, but we're very pleased. We do anticipate margins will be coming more closer to overall Envision operating margins. They have been somewhat depressed in the mid single-digits over the last year, primarily related to bringing on all the resources necessary. We're feeling very good about the next couple years in terms of growth opportunities.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Darren. Just to be specific and expand on Bill's point on the margin part of your question is, if you really look in the fourth quarter, Evolution, because again, we continue to invest and have significant changes in infrastructure around (28:00) the Ascension joint venture. It had an impact on the EmCare margins by about 40 basis points. So, that's sort of a way to look at that. Bill's correct, we do expect that to be, obviously, closer to our overall margins. But I think as we've said before, early on, those margins I think will still be lower as we work with Ascension to sort of put in different operations and processes and to increase those margins in those areas to more traditional margins.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's real helpful. And just when we think about the business unit itself, is it \u2013 does it give rise to segment reporting in 2015? Is that the right timeline?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","It could, Darren. I don't \u2013 obviously, we haven't \u2013 we don't know that as this point, but obviously as you continue to grow that with not only Ascension but some of these other initiatives, I think we obviously expect that to be a separate segment at this point. It's just not clear at what point we will break that out separately.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then my last question. I just want to clarify something, Randy. You talked a little bit about NCI and I guess there was a tax issue that impacted that number. I guess I'd be curious to know what the triggering event was for that in terms of the NCI just going forward. Do you have a way to help us think about what a normalized quarter-to-quarter number might be?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think Darren \u2013 again, I think this is a little bit unique here around just with the joint ventures and sort of the tax loss. So, it makes it look like on the surface the effective tax rate was a little higher than what you traditionally see, but again, it is offset by another aspect in minority interest. So, first on the overall kind of company consolidated tax rate, sort of that 40% \u2013 40.5% is a good number to use.","As we continue to grow and mature these contracts, I think we've said before that early in the year, we typically \u2013 again, we started with payroll taxes and adding contracts. You typically don't get to those thresholds where you'll have some sharing of those. So, we do anticipate that in the future. That tends to be probably more around the end of the year, and \u2013 but I don't anticipate, at least at this point, that being a huge number. I think in the past, we've talked about where it could be somewhere in the plus or minus $5 million range. Obviously, it wasn't that this year, but it's hard to say what that will be for 2015. But there will be some impact that will be back-end loaded as you exceed those thresholds, but I think it's not a significant number.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Darren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Maybe, with all the activity in the acquisitions, could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing from competition both on the emergency medicine and also on the anesthesia side?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, this is Bill Sanger, again. Good afternoon. Clearly, the acquisition market is heating up. We have not been as acquisitive with anesthesia as we have with focusing on more multi-specialty, larger hospital-based group practices. We do see multiples still for the larger groups in that 9 to 11 range in terms of trailing EBITDA.","As it relates to anesthesia, they have been creeping up lately. I think that most of our peers would share that those numbers are probably at least one turn greater. But more importantly is the number of larger groups that are now entertaining relationships with outsourcing companies such as us, Team Health, MEDNAX, etcetera. And I do believe that you'll see the industry as a whole being very acquisitive in 2015.","And it's worthy of mentioning that on AMR side, there still are quite a few acquisitions that we are looking at that are much more rational in terms of the multiple. As we've shared in the past, we're going to acquire these companies in that four times to six times range and write-off of that usually get a turn or turn and a half of synergy. So we'll continue to look at strong regional providers on the AMR side as well.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe, first, just a broader question. You've got a lot of moving parts as you move into 2015. When you think about the high and low end of your guidance range that you've offered, are there a couple areas that you would highlight as being the principal swing factors as to whether you end up at the high end or the low end of that guidance range?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, this is Randy. I'll start and then Bill may want to expand here. I think A.J., the one that most significantly could impact that would be acquisitions. Okay. As Bill said, there are a significant number of acquisitions out there that we're seeing, again, even more so on the EmCare side, but all across the business.","So if there was something that would impact that even on the higher end of that would be again executing on more acquisitions. And, clearly, the pipeline would support the notion that we could be more successful in acquisitions. Obviously, we've started off the year very well related to those acquisitions.","So, obviously, we anticipate that most of our growth, again, still or a large part of our growth will still be organic. I mean, we still are seeing significant demand for our services and being able to sell our services. And so we still anticipate a significant amount of growth from being able to sell new business.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. A.J., if I look at the headwinds and the tailwinds, I'll talk first about the tailwinds. Clearly, to emphasize Randy's comments, we do think the acquisition environment will be quite interesting in 2015. However, one of the things that can really move the needle are system relationships in one of the three segments. These are generally large contracts for multiple hospitals. So we are seeking in the discussions for all three segments for system contracts.","The headwinds could clearly, the changes in reimbursement. Although almost 90% of our relationships are renewable every year and so we got good visibility going into 2015 and even to 2016. So, as look at what could change on the top end, I think whether or not a health system comes forward in 2015 above what we have or one of the three operating segments and also how inquisitive we want to be and it's clearly one that will be market-centric and not just episodic in terms of where the group practice might be.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. And maybe a follow-up question specifically on the acquisitions. Obviously locum tenens is a business you had a, I guess, a toehold in is my sense of it. And this VISTA acquisition, obviously, makes you \u2013 significantly adds to it. I'm sure EmCare could keep VISTA busy all the time. Is it your intention mainly to see this as a facilitator for EmCare, or do you see it as sort of an additional leg on its own that over time will develop a lot of external business apart from EmCare?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is a very strong company in all segments of physician temporary staffing and has very strong clientele with freestanding hospitals, other providers, health systems. And we're going to continue to promote that relationship. Frankly, since we've announced the acquisition, we're having our hospital clients ask us, can you help us with primary care? Can you help us with other specialties that they're not directly providing services for?","So we're going to continue to grow that business. Now, clearly, we will be a client \u2013 internal client of VISTA and we utilize that opportunity to mitigate the cost of temporary staffing. But the primary purpose of getting into that side of the business, frankly, came from our clientele, our health systems asking us to get more involved with assisting and managing of various physicians outside the hospital-based (36:43) physician services.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Interesting. Thanks a lot.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks A.J.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. So last quarter, you discussed a new initiative to better link with community physicians. Can you just talk about \u2013 a little bit about how that's been received among various markets and then the early successes you had in the initiative? I know you had one PCT group in the Southeast that's serving as an alpha site, if you will.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I caught most -- everything you said, but I believe we're talking about the community physicians, the referring physicians to hospitals. One of the strategies we talked about at last quarter was that through Evolution Health, we're developing very strong relationship with large group practices, particularly primary care practices, where we can assist them in taking risk with health plans.","That has led into a more comprehensive relationship with these practices that extend into the hospital setting. We're still working through our first relationship, more importantly, however, is that we've had a lot of interest from other large group practices because within the context of a relationship with Evolution Health, EmCare, they're able to better manage the risks that they could take with large health plans.","So we do anticipate further announcements with larger group practices, you know, as we're able to both pre-hospital, post-hospital and hospital care through the provision of that relationship with primary care.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on 2015 outlook. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for new contract wins? I mean, do you still \u2013 have you tapped a big chunk of the pipeline, or do you see that type of momentum going forward?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","This is Randy, look, I think what we can say is, we haven't obviously, specifically broken out percentages of the growth. But I guess what I would say is we continue to see a very robust organic pipeline, as Bill said in his comments. And so we're not really seeing any real change in the momentum or the interest in what we've been able to show. So we still anticipate a very strong part of our growth continuing to be from selling new contracts.","Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray. Go ahead sir, your line is open.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Bill, I guess first off, maybe could you talk about the potential upside or opportunity with the bundling initiative and I guess how should we think about that in terms of revenue generation for 2015 and even into 2016?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would not take too much credence in 2015, because 2015, you know, it's really the start of the program. And it's getting \u2013 you know, the program in place, understanding which episodes of care that we're going to participate in. Now, that all being said, we can, I say control is probably not the right word, we've influenced several billion dollars of Medicare spending through the hospitals in which we provide care.","Now, we'll have to decide, in cooperation with our hospital partners, hospital-by-hospital, which are the episodes that we believe we can make the most significant difference in both terms of outcome and also improving costs. So it's hard for us to say. We know that the opportunity probably more is in the latter part of 2015 and going into 2016. I do believe that this whole initiative towards bundled payment may be one of the most transformational things that Medicare has done since, frankly, prospective payments.","And we're taking the right steps. We're one of the few conveners. And I think there's only 60 conveners in the nation, and we do believe that we have the statistical and analytical data to make the decisions with our partners as to which episodes we should be taking into the future, so we're very excited about this.","We're also cautious because it's a new program and we know it's going to morph over time. But I do believe that the numbers are substantial going into 2016 and 2017. And we'll see, you know, some improvement in 2015. We do know the experience of the bundled payments, for instance, like hips, have been very, very successful. They've been focused on procedures. Now it's been moved to medical care. There's a little bit more slack in how you care for patients when you don't have a procedure. So we'll see how that all shakes out, but we're very excited about the opportunity.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I guess two follow-ups. I guess, first off, you sound real excited about it saying it could be as big as the move to the prospective payment system. What gives you the confidence that it's going to be successful or that big given what happened with the Pioneer ACOs?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think this is completely different than ACOs. Number one, you have to engage the physicians. We have information by hospitals through CMS as to how our physicians treated different episodes of care. So we're starting off with the basis of understanding this is what it costs us in, say for example, congestive heart failure. It costs X dollars for you, meaning hospitalist group, at one particular hospital to treat congestive heart failure. And we're now going to take 2%, government is going to take 2% off the top and we're going to share with you some of the savings.","So we're starting off with understanding what we need to move and what we need to do in terms of physician behavior. When ACOs first came together, it truly was a partnership between hospitals, insurance companies and providers.","But in that approach, what they did is, essentially, say okay, we're going to have a group of patients. There was no real agenda as to what was going to drive it and where they were wanting to go.","I think the bundled payment program would be the precursor, and frankly, I think, ultimately, may very well challenge ACOs in terms of what role they play in reducing costs and improving outcomes.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And then I guess the other part of the question is, what else do you need to add or what would you like to add within your portfolio to strategically position the company in a better way to participate or do well in this model?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think one of the black holes for hospitals is the intensive care unit. And I do think the role of the intensivist is going to be very important in being successful with the bundled payment program, and so that's an area that we are looking at very seriously.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, great. And then I guess, Randy, just wanted to go back to the 2015 guidance. I don't know if you're willing to give the details, but obviously, organic growth has been pretty strong, 13% I think this quarter. What sort of organic growth have you embedded in your 2015 guidance?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, Kevin, look, we've not, obviously, provided that information, so I can't get into those details. What I would just tell you, generally, is that we continue to expect, strong organic growth.","I don't know that we or others have necessarily assumed that same-store volumes may be at the same rates because then you're facing a comp that's a little higher from this year. So I think we've moderated some on that area, but still feel pretty bullish around, obviously, the ability to get new contracts and then, obviously, included some level of acquisitions as well. So as Bill said, really, the momentum in the business in terms of the organic and the acquisition pipeline is still very strong, which is what gives us the confidence in the guidance that we put out.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then how about any guidance on cash flow or CapEx for 2015?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","No. We haven't traditionally, honestly, provided that guidance as well. Look, as we grow the business, we do anticipate being able to improve our cash flow. So we clearly expect a higher level of cash flow from growth in the business as well as continued reduction in DSO.","Our CapEx will be \u2013 I think our maintenance CapEx is fairly similar. I think as we grow, and most of that of course is on the AMR side. So, if you have other contract starts, you could see an increase there, but I would not anticipate a major change in CapEx at all.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And then last, any update on the RFPs for the AMR business? Just wondering if you could give us an update on what contracts you're looking at? Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Look, we have several RFPs we responded to, and as has been the case for the last several years, they always are taking long \u2013 I mean the communities taking longer to make their decisions, but we have several out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give a sense at all with the margin profile or the new deals that you've brought in or maybe even the annualized impact of EBITDA from those deals?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Ralph, I think what we generally talked about is, if you looked at those sort of on an aggregate basis, I would think of those as pretty similar to our overall EmCare margins. So that's what I would tell you at this point. Obviously they're a little different within each one, but, again, on an aggregate basis, they're very similar to where we are at EmCare.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And just to be \u2013 I guess, just to be clear, you guys talked about $435 million of annualized revenue. Would I put that type margin on that to get a fair number of sort of the contribution from EBITDA?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","You would on an annualized basis. Now, just remember on a realized, because there is \u2013 some of that's happening in February and we expect the last one to happen in the next few days, you'll get most of the year, but not the full year on the ones that we've announced.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then have you guys given or will you give what's embedded in the 2015 guidance for \u2013 in terms of incremental reform benefit? And then I guess along those lines, do you have an estimate of how much exchange volume you actually saw in 2014? And if possible, what percentage of those were in federal versus state exchanges?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Ralph, couple things on that. Look, we've not said that on the health reform. We talked in general that says, as reform did move throughout the year, you saw some more movement throughout the year, that we anticipated still an incremental benefit in 2015, which we did include in our guidance. I wouldn't say it's significant, just because, obviously, you have an annualized effect versus sort of a realized effect in 2014. So we did embed some of that assumption in our guidance.","We did not embed, necessarily, a significant continued change in sort of the Medicaid, for example, the self-pay to Medicaid. So while we're still seeing some of that, we didn't sort of project a big change in that, more of the annualized impact. On the exchange side, Ralph, it's always been very small for us. I think it was around 1% of our volume, very small. It's not really been a big impact for us. And so, again, we've not assumed any sort of real change on that front. I don't know the breakdown off the top of my head, Ralph, of whether it's federal or state from that standpoint.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, all right. No worries. And then just for the fourth quarter, how much do you think flu may have helped the quarter and maybe what impact did it have on sort of the optics of the pricing stat, did that sort of depress that stat as well?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, as you know, obviously, we did see higher flu volume across the country, and that does have a lower acuity, so it, clearly, had some impact on that. I don't know that we've done a calculation on exactly what that would be. But it is a little hard to break out. The one thing that's a little different that we saw this time from what we've seen before is, if you looked in the last couple \u2013 Q2 and Q3, we've actually seen same-store volumes higher in Medicaid Expansion states than in non-Expansion states. This time, it flipped. It was higher in the non-Expansion states. And, again, given Texas and Florida being half our business, that's probably driven more by the flu impact than just sort of the health reform mix. But clearly, there was a flu benefit.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. That's hopeful. And then just the last one. Would you mind just running through those fuel numbers again? I couldn't catch them all in terms of just the annualized spend that you guys have. And then maybe it would be helpful to just understand what you've assumed for 2015. Do you assume sort of a similar price to where it is now or do you assume sort of normal and is that some opportunity for some upside? Thanks.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Ralph, so just kind of restate again, we spend about $45 million to $50 million a year on the AMR side. If you look at, again, just because volumes have been going up, as we said on a transport-adjusted basis, we had about $1 million lower fuel costs in Q4 than we saw earlier in the year before the change in fuel prices.","So look, we did assume some change in fuel in our guidance. I think since we had developed our internal budgets and all that, we have seen some additional reductions in fuel costs. So I would say part of that is we assume. But we don't know where it will stay. Obviously, that will be very dependent on what happens going forward. So the only couple things that I mentioned on that front, Ralph was that not all of ours is sort of gasoline or unleaded like you see at the pump, 35% of our fuel is still diesel, which is still a higher price than you see, and then about 25% of our spend was hedged previously under an older rate. So with all of that, we'll still have 25% of that spend that's hedged through 2015. We are now looking at hedges again now given the lower pricing to try and lock in some of the lower pricing. But, clearly, if it stays where it is, we expect lower \u2013 continued benefit from that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks Ralph.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Go ahead sir, your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a good year. First question for me, Bill, you sound very excited, obviously, about the contracting pipeline. But as we look at the details of that, are these new contracts with existing relationships, you know, with the nationals that you signed? And also if you don't mind just giving us some update on whether these are extensions beyond the ED hospitalist bundle that you've signed in the past.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Generally, around 30% of our organic sales are into existing customer relationships. As you all obviously know, we've had a wonderful relationship with HCA and UHS and we've seen substantial growth. At the same time, frankly (52:32) our pipeline, our pipeline is much more being filled by the non-HCA, non-USH hospitals, and so it's a very diverse portfolio.","We do expect the relationship to be probably a little higher in terms of cross-selling this year because there are other opportunities that are presenting I think in other services. And as we look at what hospitals are really looking for in the future, it's you know that bundled service of not only ED and the hospitalist, but also our surgery program has been very effective working with anesthesia. We believe that program is going to get tremendous traction in 2015. You'll hear more about selling our surgery program in 2015 than you have in the past.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And then just as a follow-up to that, Bill, one of the comments in the press release is that the rate for the bundled ED hospitalists has gone up. What is the pricing dynamic there? What's driving that? And obviously, as you bring new contracts in, I'm guessing we're starting at a lower margin, but how should we think about the pricing on that bundle, and also the flipside of that is what service lines are seeing pricing pressure right now?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we haven't seen a lot of pricing pressure. Keep in mind that generally speaking, we receive our reimbursement from third-party payors, Medicare, Medicaid, pilot programs and health plans and managed care. What we are seeing, obviously, is the opportunity to work with hospitals to mitigate their subsidies on certain hospital-based services. And we're not seeing a lot of pressure because those subsidies have been relatively stable over time. So we're not seeing a lot of pressure to take more of the subsidy, if you will, than what we generally are comfortable with. So I would say, if you look at the margins of our combined integrated service lines, I would expect them to stay very similar to what they've been in the past.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And then, last question from me, Randy, just a clarification. How much incremental M&A is in the guidance?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, Brian, we had \u2013 again, we did not give out specific numbers for acquisitions. What we have said is that in our guidance, we did assume some level of acquisitions. And so, I think when you look at the ones that we've announced, okay, we had \u2013 I think we've talked before that, basically, the EMA and the SEA acquisitions we felt like would be really key to replacing sort of the parity on that and that VISTA as well. I would assume that that was included in our guidance only because we had some level of unknown acquisitions. But it is a substantial part of that. So that's really probably all I can say on that front.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin of Barclays. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Just want to sort of take a step back on the acquisitions as well and think about sort of the environment. You guys are suggesting that the valuations are higher than we've seen in the past, yet there seems to be more interest, and I think you alluded to the sellers being more willing to talk.","So, I'm just trying to put all that together, what makes you guys more interested in these big acquisitions at these prices, or is it just simply \u2013 this is probably what the price was for the bigger assets and just now they're more willing to talk to you guys? I'm just trying to...","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","What we're finding, Josh, this is Bill, is that the physicians are looking at where healthcare is going in the future. Notwithstanding, the opportunity set presenting to all providers with the Accountable Care Act, they're concerned about the long-term viability of the single-specialty, particularly as it relates to the hospital-based services.","And they're looking for ways in which they can become more involved with not just an episode of care with the patient, but managing the patients in various touch points, which we refer to the continuum of care.","So they can go out \u2013 frankly, some of these large groups are very large and they have the resources to do it. They can do it themselves and reinvent the wheel or they could affiliate with a company that has a vision of healthcare that is a little bit more apprehensive than just an episode.","Now, clearly, look, we provide multiple episodes of care. But what we've done is we've stepped back and basically identified where are the touch points that we want to be involved with the patient that will generate an opportunity for revenue enhancement and better outcomes.","And as we describe these opportunities to large groups \u2013 and frankly, it's not that we're not interested in smaller groups, but our interest is in large groups and geographic areas that we identified in our plan and we're going to be true to that approach towards acquisitions. They understand the story. They understand how we're executing. And they've seen we've got it. And I think that we have a value proposition to the docs that is very beneficial.","Now, multiples are the multiples. It's what the market will dictate. If multiples get too high, we have a very strong organic story, you know, we're double-digit organic growth without making the first acquisition, so if multiples get out of hand, it will probably reemphasize even more so our organic strategy. So we feel like a really good physician. Look we've identified multiple large groups that have a similar vision to healthcare in the future that we have, so we do sound bullish today because we are very bullish.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And obviously, I completely agree and understand the perspective of a bundled world or some sort of value-based reimbursement where it's more around holistic care. The one area I struggle though is ED, you know, sort of how is that theoretically going to be included in the bundle? And are you seeing the bigger groups are not necessarily be the ED groups with maybe anesthesiologists....","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, most of the large groups are ED groups. Let me explain to you how important emergency services are in EDs.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","When you think, over a hundred million individuals a year access emergency services. And more often than not, one of the first entries into healthcare is through an emergency provider. Having a program, for instance, our programs, we have ER diversions in about 14 cities throughout this country where someone calls 911 or they show up at an ER and sometimes they have to be admitted because there's no alternative other than admission because the home environment is not conducive to the care and home care is not what's really working for this patient. We've worked with various EDs, including ED's that are not part of our team, as an alternative to where we care for this patient, the medical home as we call it. So EDs are very important in managing the cost structure. Because once a patient gets into the hospital, the cost really begins to increase substantially for that health plan.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, perfect. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of Citi. Go ahead sir, your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple questions. Randy, I know Kevin asked about this. I just want to go back to it quickly, just on the move to exclude the transaction costs.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","I understand that others are doing that. Do you actually have an estimate of how much you think you'll exclude in 2015?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Well, Gary, it's probably a few million. I mean I don't know the exact number that we had in the plan, but again, remember even these transactions that we just recently announced, a big part of what we spend in those in terms of some of that cost we really saw in Q4, so some of that \u2013 there will be a little bit of that that comes into the 1st of the year, Gary. But I would say overall, because we didn't have outside of that a big \u2013 a significant assumption of acquisitions, it's probably a few million.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Not something that will be material.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Not a big number. Yeah, no.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then I wanted to go to Evolution Health for a moment. Bill, you had said it's kind of a mid-single-digit margin, and Randy, you had said that's about a 40 basis point drag on EmCare's margins in the quarter. So if my arithmetic is right, that would put it at maybe a $35 million revenue contribution in the fourth quarter and maybe $140 million annual run rate. Is that in the ballpark?","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","Yes. It was a little less than that, Gary, when you look at from a revenue perspective. Again, probably closer to $30 million, so not dramatically different.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Randel G. Owen - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer","And that's pretty obviously, some of the \u2013 we didn't include, all the Ascension set coming on happens after the 1st of the year.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Right. And then Bill, I wanted to kind of just go to you on that a little bit. I know 18 months ago, two years ago even, you really felt like Evolution was engaged in conversations with payors for hundreds of millions of dollars potentially of business and maybe that's still to come, but it certainly maybe has played out a little slower than we had anticipated. If that's right, why is that business or why is that shift happening slower than you might've thought a couple years ago?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And Gary, you're right. It is happening slower, but it is happening. And I will tell you, it's for three reasons. Number one, health plans in particular, which are our big clients, really those are where the large, to your point, the $100 million plus contracts come.","First of all, they want us to run pilot. They say, fine, here's several thousand patients, we'll see how well you do. Second of all, they want us to go at risk, which is fine. However, the data they provide us generally is not scrubbed. It takes multiple back-and-forth \u2013 multiple back-and-forth. Without mentioning the health plans by names, one particular health plan took us a year and a half to finally get the right data for us to understand exactly the patient base they wanted us to manage. So what is happening is, it's taken a longer time to get the right data, have the actuaries basically identify the risk reward. At the same time, I think it's more just sheer timing. I'm still very confident about these hundred million dollar plus contracts that are out there and, the results of \u2013 the pilots of 8,000 to 10,000 patients that we're seeing are dramatic. I mean, very dramatic. So I'm very bullish and will continue to be very bullish about the future of Evolution.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I just want to go to BPCI with just a couple follow-ups. Are you more \u2013 do you see more opportunity as a convener with a lot of data attempting to share in the savings that underlying providers, essentially non-EmCare providers are going to generate. Or do you see more opportunity for economics to Envision with your own docs as the episode initiators? Is it both, is it even, is it too early to tell?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I hesitate because it is early to tell. We are clearly going to be conveners for our own services. We do believe that our model is a good model. Our data analytics are very strong with a very good actuarial group. Now, whether or not others would like to use us as convener, we'll provide that option for them. There are a few companies out there that are fairly large, and that's all they do. And so, our intention initially is not so much to market our services as a convener, but to make them available for those who are interested in working with us.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And I guess my other follow-up question just on the concept in general is, there's been a fair amount of discussion about it lately, so many of your peers have talked about it. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think it's a two-year program and how do you think about \u2013 how do you think about the thought that CMS rolls this out, providers get to essentially cherry-pick episodes where they know their data looks good and they can save money, and then year three, CMS comes back and rebases you to a new cost baseline. I mean, does it \u2013 do you look at that and does that feel a risk over time to the program or?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, make no mistake about it. And we know that as you seek improvements, the next level is to seek better improvements. I do believe, to your point, that there will be cherry-picking. Folks will go after the areas, the episodes \u2013 I'm sorry, where they know they can make a difference.","And I fully expect Medicare to come back and rebase it. That's okay. I think they're testing this program and they're going to find that it's effective and they may very well morph over time in terms of how this program looks. The reality is there's such inefficiencies in the system as you well know that even if they do rebase, they'll have to be cautious not to overly emphasize the rebasing because they won't get participants.","But I do think the program will morph over time. As you know, the pilot is for a couple years. It could be written into law after one year if CMS determines that it's effective and can include, mandated certain episodes. So I do think there's a lot of unknowns in the programs. One known that I do feel confident about is understanding our data in order to identify which episodes are appropriate for EmCare and what are the protocols necessary to create better outcomes at lower costs.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Finally, did you say all your physicians are enrolled and that's where all your hospitals are, I didn't catch that?","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","We are a convener in all of our physicians that are the physician of record...","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Right.","William A. Sanger - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","...will be episode initiators.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Okay.

Our presenters today are Bill Sanger, Chairman, President and CEO; and Randy Owen, CFO and COO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially.","We encourage you to review the risk factors section in our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, to be filed in the coming weeks.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon, along with our remarks today are made as of today, April 30th, 2015, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and adjusted EPS.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. This afternoon, we reported results from operations in the first quarter of 2015 that included revenue growth of 23% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 16%.","We're pleased with our ability to consistently post double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This performance is derived from two major sources: First, our topline benefited from strong net new contract wins from same market growth. Second, acquisitions are playing an increasingly important role in our growth profile, as evidenced by the increased contribution to revenues this quarter.","We feel strongly that these financial results and the activities that are driving these results affirm that we have the right strategy for an evolving health services environment.","Across our operations, we are advancing our market-centric integrated strategy. Two markets that we're seeing impressive early results of integrated care across AMR, EmCare, and Evolution Health are Las Vegas and Central Texas.","Our coordination of care approach is adding tremendous value to patients, health plans, and facilities and serves as the model for other targeted markets. At EmCare, revenue grew by 28%, of which 13% came from acquisitions.","As a reminder, our acquisition strategy is very market-centric. We seek high quality providers to provide an integrated care model and it's the basis for pioneering the delivery of care.","As noted on Q4 call, two recent acquisitions that closed in the quarter included Emergency Medical Associates and Scottsdale Emergency Associates. Combined these practices have nearly 1,000 clinicians, with annual revenues of more than $300 million and 1.9 million patient visits.","We also closed VISTA Staffing, a physician staffing company. VISTA creates several growth opportunities, based on expanded relationships with health systems as well as assisting us in reducing costs of temporary staffing.","EmCare's adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.6%. As noted in our press release, when excluding the impact of Medicaid parity and a minority interest benefit last year, adjusted EBITDA would have increased by 22.6% at EmCare.","In the quarter, EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was impacted by lower profitability from certain anesthesia contracts, due to lower than expected of collected revenues, which Randy will discuss in just a few minutes.","At AMR, we had a great quarter. Revenue grew by 13.5% while adjusted EBITDA was up by 32.4%. We benefited from strong organic revenue growth of 11.5%, and experienced improved deployment.","The investments made at AMR's technology and our emphasis on continuous process improvement, have been instrumental in improving our human resources and asset allocation.","We've also been effective in promoting our services by leveraging our mobile integrated delivery capabilities. As an example, we were recently awarded six transport contracts at major multi-campus health systems.","We also started three new contracts with regional health plans, and we're seeing positive results of our Oregon-managed transportation contract, which started earlier this year. These are highly contested RFPs and our integrated care delivery services were key elements in awarding us these contracts.","Our presence in the acute and post-acute setting has had a very positive impact on AMR's performance. For example, now we use community paramedics and hospital-based transitional care programs in to conduct post-discharge assessments for Evolution Health.","At Evolution Health, revenues increased by 43% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by the Phase I implementation of the Ascension Health joint venture. This spring, we will complete the implementation of the five markets of Phase I, move onto the next phase, which will add up to 18 markets over the next two years. We're also in discussions with other health systems for similar types of arrangements.","As it relates to Evolution Health's negotiations with payers, we're moving from pilot programs to expanded implementations, including final negotiations with a large payer in Florida, to manage the post-acute care of 60,000 Medicare Advantage patients. We anticipate starting this program in the third quarter of 2015.","At this time, I want to update you on our participation in the bundled payment for care improvement program. Earlier this month, we submitted our specific selections for episodes beginning July 1. Evolution Health will participate as an awarding convener in and as an episode initiator under model three.","And a number of our EmCare hospital practices will participate as model two episode initiators. We have also preserved the ability to expand participation for additional episodes that begin in October.","Our initial participation will have 48 tax IDs or TINs, with the first 17 practices going live July 1. Each practice location will participate in a variety of episodes, ranging from a low of three to a high of 20.","We're taking a thoughtful and strategic approach to participating in this program, as we develop infrastructure to support the care design and expand our integrated post-acute model with Evolution, EmCare, and AMR.","While there's clearly a lot of interest in this program, and we will continue to be measured in our discussing of financial metrics related to the bundled payments, given that the benefits will not be known until late 2015, will probably not be realized until early 2016.","In closing, we believe our results are indicative of the market receptivity of our care coordinated integrated service offerings and our proven ability to improve patient outcomes and experiences, while lowering costs.","Now, before I turn the call over to Randy, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 35,000 clinicians and support staff for their efforts in making a difference in the lives of the patients we serve. Randy?","Randel Owen","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon. As we highlighted in our press released this afternoon, Envision generated revenue of $1.24 billion for the first quarter, which was up by 22.7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $128.9 million grew by 16.3%, and our EBITDA margin was 10.4%. Net income of $33.4 million grew by 34.4% and adjusted EPS was $0.26, increased by 30%.","Our revenue growth accelerated in the quarter from strong organic volumes and net new contracts and a greater contribution coming from acquisitions, particularly following the three previously announced transactions completed in the first quarter. We'll see the weighting of acquisition-driven growth increase next quarter, when we'll have a full quarter contribution from these acquisitions in our results.","Our results reflect strong revenue growth from both of our segments. EmCare revenue grew by 28%, which includes revenue growth of 43% in our Evolution business. Revenue growth at AMR was 13.5%.","In our EmCare segment, net revenue was $825.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 28%. This includes $38.8 million of revenue from Evolution Health. The EmCare segment growth was comprised of 13.3% from acquisitions and 14.7% from organic sources, both same-store revenue growth, and net new business.","Included in EmCare's net new revenue growth is a contribution of 1.4%, related to the initial implementation of the Evolution Health joint venture with Ascension Health.","Our acquisition-related revenue growth came from the three acquisitions that closed during the quarter, coupled with the Phoenix Physician Group acquisition completed in the summer of last year.","Revenue from EmCare net new contract wins accounted for $56.3 million of revenue growth, or 8.7%. Approximately 40% of the contracts started since last year were from cross-selling opportunities, primarily the expansion of our hospitalist practices that have been integrated with ED services.","On a same-store basis, our revenue grew by 5%. Overall volume grew by 6.3%, including a higher same-store ED volume of 7.5%. Overall rate declined by 1.3%, which is primarily attributable to the loss of $7 million of Medicaid parity revenue, which was discontinued on January 1st, 2015.","While we had a rate growth of approximately 1.5% from our emergency department services, there was a corresponding decrease in the rate for other service lines, primarily anesthesia. EmCare's self-pay payer mix declined by approximately 90 basis points in the first quarter, when compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","EmCare's adjusted EBITDA was $77.1 million, an increase of 7.6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.3% is lower year-over-year, primarily due to a few factors. First, last year's adjusted EBITDA included a net benefit of approximately $5.5 million from Medicaid parity.","Second, we had a minority interest benefit of $3.3 million last year that related to a final calculation of 2013 metrics achievements in our HCA joint venture. These two items had a combined 120 basis point impact on margin quarter-over-quarter. When excluding these two items, adjusted EBITDA growth would've been 22.6%.","Evolution Health contributed $3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, compared to $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. Despite the increase in net revenue, Evolution Health EBITDA declined because of infrastructure investments that we've made to grow this business, and start-up costs and relatively lower margin contracts included in the initial phase of the Ascension joint venture. As we've previously noted, we anticipate that margins from these contracts will improve throughout the year.","EmCare's EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $7 million, which was related to lower profitability in certain anesthesia contracts. Although our volumes and compensation were at expected levels, we experienced reduced collections as a result of billing and collection challenges by a third party for those contracts.","We're confident this will be rectified. We've stepped up collection efforts on those accounts, by bringing in additional resources, and we are consolidating our anesthesia billing and collection services on a common platform.","We're also employing additional contractual options and believe that in the coming months, all of our efforts will mitigate the impact of what we experienced in the first quarter.","At our AMR segment, revenue was $419.4 million and grew by 13.5%, while adjusted EBITDA of $51.8 million increased by 32.4%. This quarter continues a trend of improved operating important performance and efficiencies at AMR.","Revenue growth was principally from same market rate and volume growth of 9.1%, while net new contracts were up 2.4%, and acquisitions contributed about 2% to growth. On a same market basis, volume grew by 7.8%, while overall rate was up by 1.4%. Payer mix in the first quarter was relatively unchanged from the end of 2014.","Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points, of which we attribute about 140 basis points of improvement to higher volume, more efficient expense management, including the deployment of personnel from our ongoing initiatives, and lower fuel costs. The remaining 40 basis points of margin improvement can be attributed to better contract mix within our managed transportation services offering.","AMR's compensation and benefit cost grew by 5.7% for the quarter, while operating expenses grew by 25.3%. The higher rate of operating expense growth is due to an increase in our managed transportation services, with the majority of costs are for third-party services, and a transition of our billing services to a third-party, both of which are now included in operating expenses. Our fuel costs for the quarter were about $2 million lower than Q1 of 2014.","In this afternoon's press release, we also announced that AMR has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ambulance operations located in the Northeast. These operations are expected to generate annual revenue of approximately $25 million, and the transaction is incorporated in our outlook as part of AMR's acquisition target for 2014. The transaction is expected to be completed by the third quarter.","Our cash flow from operating activities continues to improve year-over-year. We generated $45.3 million from operations this quarter, up 50%. We invested $498.3 million to complete three acquisitions during the quarter, using a combination of cash and borrowings under our asset-based lending facility.","Adjusted free cash flow was $37.1 million for the quarter, which compares to $40.8 million in the first quarter of 2014, due to a timing difference in insurance collateral funding and capital expenditures.","At March 31st, we had approximately $2.3 billion in total debt outstanding, which is up from $2 billion at year-end, due to acquisition. We currently have about $200 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility.","Operator, at this time, we'll open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Mr. Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Randy, very quickly, first on the tax rate. How should we think about your tax rate going forward? It looks pretty high during the quarter.","Randel Owen","We expect our overall tax rate really to be at about 40.5% for the full year sort of in that range.","Brian Tanquilut","Okay. Got it. And then, Bill, just a question on organic growth. How -- you've done a good job growing the organic growth of EmCare business, primary through new contract wins and cross-selling. So, how you look at the runway left within the existing relationships that you've signed? Also, as you look at the discussions that are ongoing with potential new hospital partners? ","William Sanger","Yes, Brian, if you look at our growth profile last quarter, about 40% of the EmCare growth was from cross-selling to existing customer base. That fact notwithstanding, as we have said in the past, our pipeline every quarter proceeds to get larger and larger.","So, we anticipate a profile that we've seen in the last couple of quarters will continue the rest of this year, and so we are pretty confident about sustaining that organic growth rate at both companies.","Brian Tanquilut","Got it. And last question for me. In terms of the ramp, as you roll out these new contracts, at what point does the margin degradation that we see from the new contracts flatten out and bounce back? Just trying to balance, Randy, new contracts coming in, older contracts starting to mature, and ramp-up in margins. How should we think about that dynamic?","William Sanger","Well, Brian, a couple of things. Remember, if you look at margin year-over-year, a lot of that, again, was driven from the items we mentioned in the release and the loss of parity. And I think that's similar to a lot of companies in our sector.","When you look at contracts specifically, especially on the EmCare side, it can take six to 12 months to get to a more mature margin. So, while you do have those contracts coming online and getting to a normal profile in that period of time, obviously we're still adding new contracts which start out at a lower margin, including those, as we start up the Ascension joint venture, which I think we talked before around, we anticipated those starting out at lower margins and improving throughout the year.","Brian Tanquilut","All right. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from A. J. Rice from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Hello everyone. A couple of questions, if I might ask. First maybe on the ambulance side of the business, AMR, obviously a nice acquisition coming down the path. Can you just comment on what you're seeing more broadly, in terms of the pipeline there?","And has there been any change? I know that's where you were still seeing some pretty attractive pricing. Has that been consistent? And then maybe also comment on prospects for big contracts to be let out this year on that side of the business?","William Sanger","Good afternoon, A. J. This is Bill. We continue to see and feel very encouraged about the ability to execute on several acquisitions on the AMR side this year. The reality is 911 contracts are very difficult to unseat, as you well know. We don't see any very large contracts come out this year.","San Diego, as you know, has been talked about for the last several years, and they keep continuing to renew that contract. So, I think as it relates to large 911s, I don't expect to see many this year.","There are a couple that are being tested, that we're hopeful that would come into our direction. I will say that we look forward to a continued strong organic growth, supplemented by several good-sized tuck-ins on AMR side.","A. J. Rice","Okay.","Randel Owen","A. J., this is Randy, and just a follow-up on that. Pricing is still very stable, A. J., in that sort of six times to seven times EBITDA multiple. There's not a lot of competition or roll-up going on there.","So, those are, again, pretty accretive, and as Bill noted, probably more tuck-in acquisitions. There are a number that we're obviously still looking at and working on at this time.","I agree with Bill, while there's probably not a lot of really large 911s. We're being successful in contacting with health systems and are seeing even some smaller 911s coming out. For example, Arizona, we've had really good success here, as we started service recently, once we got that CO win.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then, maybe my follow-up question would be on Evolution Health, obviously, a very interesting evolving area and you're a trailblazer are there. I guess when we think about like the potential to do the deal with the Medicare Advantage provider down in Florida, what does that payment structure look like? Are you getting a per-member per-month payment, or is it some kind of incentive deal? How is the payment program evolving for Evolution Health? ","William Sanger","A. J., this is Bill. We're still in final negotiations as to what arrangement that we're going to agree on. We will probably end up in a bundled payment with a risk quarter, or a PMPM with a risk quarter.","A. J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","William Sanger","Thanks A. J.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Sir your line is open.","Joshua Raskin","Good evening. First question just on guidance. Any changes to previous guidance or any underlying metrics we should think about?","Randel Owen","No, not at this time, Josh.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. I guess and within the segments, is it fair to say AMR are probably running a little higher and EmCare maybe a little lower? Is that fair?","Randel Owen","I don't know about for the year. Obviously, starting out, I think you see a little bit of that, but I don't know that I would say that for the year. Obviously, AMR continues to do really well. And I think, as Bill indicated, we felt good about EmCare prospects and that. So, I don't know that I would say there's any significant change between the two businesses that we're seeing.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. And second question, on the anesthesiology, I think you said it was a $7 million impact on the collections? It just seemed like a relatively large number. Can you help us size what are total anesthesia revenues or how we should think about that in the grand scheme of things?","Randel Owen","Look, it's not -- when you look at anesthesia revenues, we haven't, Josh, given that out specifically. Anesthesia is, I think, a little over 10% of our revenue stream. That's a rough range. I don't have it right in front of me, Josh. So--","Joshua Raskin","Is that EmCare or?","Randel Owen","I'm sorry?","Joshua Raskin","Is that EmCare or is that of --?","Randel Owen","Yeah, I know -- when you look at EmCare, yes. When you look at EmCare. We did have a challenge, we've had a challenge, we decided to be conservative and lower our collection estimates, based on more recent data that we are seeing.","So, as I said, I think we feel like we're on top of that and have made some changes that can enhance that, and there is other levers to pull as well on those contracts. I think we feel good about being able to right-size that with that issue that we encountered.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. And last one, following up on A. J.'s question around that 60,000 Florida MA plan. I know -- and I understood the comments from Bill, that it has not been determined. If it is a PMPM or something like that, what services exactly -- like how would that work? What exactly are you responsible? And is there even a broad range? Is this $50 of the premium or $100 of the PMPM? I'm just curious about the range of services.","Randel Owen","Well, the range of services, Josh, are really related to once a patient is discharged, working with a physician during the discharge, in creating the transitional care program. These are patients that will require post-transitional care most of them.","And it will be primarily be limited to unplanned care, any post-acute homebound care, any readmission risk we will not take. So, it will be provision of certain services in the home and the provision of managing and developing the transitional care program.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. I guess I understand that. So, you'll be responsible for any of the discharges for any of the home-care services. Would you had to rent a network of other providers? Or is that done through Evolution?","Randel Owen","No, this will all be done through Evolution.","Joshua Raskin","Okay, got it. All right. Thanks.","Randel Owen","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Matthew Borsch","Yeah, I guess sticking with Evolution for a second. I know late last year, or maybe it was early this year, you guys had talked about conversations with the states on opportunities to serve the dual eligible population. I'm just curious if you can give us any update on that front?","William Sanger","Sure. We have been working, primarily with two states and have been very active with one state. As you know, the state has to designate, first, the particular health plan in which the patient would be identified and then we are working these particular health plans in this state and negotiating the scope of services.","The process is taking quite a bit of time with this particular state. It was supposed to start July of last year with the dual-eligible that was delayed until October, which has now has been delayed until May of this year. We're very confident about our ability to meet the needs of those dual eligible and negotiate favorable rates with the health plans that are contracting directly with the states.","Our preference, frankly, Josh, is to work directly with the states, and provide the state, as a preferred vendor relationship, that they will go to the health plans that are going to be managing these lives and say that we're the preferred vendor for the post-acute management of these patients.","We believe we can get there. It's going to take some time, but we're very confident that the combination of our ability to manage unplanned care, which is very important with this population, combined with our 24-hour, seven-day a week medical command center with clinicians will be the differentiating factor that states will look at as unique and really focused on managing that cost structure.","Matthew Borsch","Are you fighting an uphill battle, though, on that front and to the extent there is a trend of carving in now it seems to be in vogue, maybe correct me if you see it differently?","William Sanger","No, we really don't. The biggest challenge we see, frankly, has to do with the state finalizing their decision as to which health plans they're going to, if you will, carve up to dual eligible.","And then, we have to negotiate with those health plans. This is why we wanted to work more closely with the states, be in a preferred vendor relationship and state-sponsored, so that when a particular health plan is awarded a certain number of lives, consistent with that award is, we have a relationship with Evolution Health, which would be part of the post-acute care management of these patients. That's our preferred strategy, it's one that we have spent a lot of time on, and one we are pretty confident we are going to get.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Your line is open sir.","Ryan Daniels","Yeah, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Let me ask a question one on the M&A front. I know Randy you mentioned you have about $200 million left on your revolver. Obviously, some cash on the balance sheet, but as bigger deals arise, are you thinking about back going back to the market for additional capacity?","And number two, what's the leverage ratio you would be comfortable with going forward?","Randel Owen","Ryan, look, you clearly would, depending on the size of transactions, if you needed funding, obviously you would go to market to obtain that funding. Now, obviously, on smaller transactions, you don't and with cash flow coming in throughout the year, you can deal with those. But on larger ones you clearly would. Obviously, the good thing is, the market is pretty wide open, right. So we don\u2019t have any concern about being able to get liquidity to close transactions that we deem to be a part of Envision. So I'm not concerned about that at all. ","If you look at from a total leverage standpoint, Ryan, I think we've always said that we could go up to, maybe, close to five times or so leverage, because we consistently deleverage fairly quickly. So I think that sort of a range, 4.5 to 5 times is something we could be very comfortable with.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. Perfect. If we think about Evolution another question there, as that becomes a larger part of the business, is there anything other than the start-up costs that we should think about, about the profitability cadence throughout a year, meaning maybe there's at-risk fees? I don't know if that's the case, but that pushes some of the profits to be back-end weighted, et cetera. Just anything we need to think about for the model?","William Sanger","I think early on in the next couple or three years, as we look at risk models, whether it be PMPM or full-capitated risk, we are going to be very cautious that we have risk quarters that can protect us on the downside, obviously, also limit some of our offside. And we are willing to give away little bit of that upside to cut for downside until we have enough actuarial data to go at full risk.","So we are pretty confident that we are going to continuously just increase our profitability and our margins on retirement. I'm very confident that these discussions that we are having, typically with the health plans are going to be pretty substantial over the next several months.","Randel Owen","And then, Ryan, just more -- I guess, if you look at in the near term, I think, we've talked before to everyone that, Ascension joint venture that we anticipated that sort of margins in some of those markets that are part of the initial phase really were lower margins initially and it would take year or whatever to get those -- up to more traditional kind of margins. So I think you could see that cadence again, where it starts out a little lower, and then over time, as Bill said, we would anticipate that increasing.","Hello? Is everyone there?","Operator","Yes, sir, ready for the next question?","Randel Owen","Yes, we are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open, sir.","Kevin Ellich","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I've got two questions, one on the ambulance AMR business and one on BPCI. I guess, starting off with AMR, how should we think about the fixed transport contracts and the regional health plans that you talked about? How much should that add, and how much could we be looking at on a go-forward basis?","Randel Owen","You know, I don\u2019t have that in front of me on those contracts, sorry about that. But, look, I think if you look at the way I was thinking about that is, for you continue to see AMR having really good double-digit revenue growth sort of in that low double-digit range, I think, we would expect to see that. You continue to see that double-digit growth with these included as well as other contracts that we are working on and other things that we could get. ","So I think it helps sustain a really strong organic growth rate that we've seen here in the last year or two.","William Sanger","You know, what we really like about -- many things we like about AMR, but it\u2019s a very leverageable business. You look at just the performance of last quarter, 14 and change topline and 32% bottom-line, it\u2019s a very leverageable business. And our focus -- particularly in market been able to leverage that without adding much infrastructure is really important and as you hear about more of these regional contracts coming out with our systems, they\u2019re going to pretty high margin businesses for us.","Kevin Ellich","Okay, that was actually going to be a quick follow-up there, but that's helpful, Bill. Thanks. Switching over to BPCI, you provided some great detail and information. Wondering for the Model 2 participation, just wanted to clarify, you said 48 tax IDs. Who are you going to use as the convener for Model 2, and how much risk are you taking on?","And then the other part to that question is, just wondering, without post-acute clinicians, do you think that puts you at a disadvantage in managing the costs?","William Sanger","Well, let me first answer that first question. Model 2, which is our hospitalist program, we have obviously have 48 TINs that we have applied for. We do have the opportunity to manage the post-acute. We can scale up evolution in most of -- any other market in which believe there is critical mass and we can earn profitability. So we are pretty confident about our ability to manage the post-acute under Model 2.","Keep in mind in Model 3, Evolution Health is both a convener and an episode initiator. As it relates to who we use as a convener for Model 2, we are using Remedy. We struck a very, very favorable relationship with them. Frankly, we could have extended by definition CMS would allow us to extend our convener status to Model 2.","But we felt that Remedy had a lot of data that would have taken us a fairly long time to put together. So we struck a pretty favorable deal with them and we feel that will be very effective under this program, both in Model 2 and Model 3. ","Kevin Ellich","Great. Thank you.","William Sanger","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to go back to anesthesiology, and maybe understand what the issue is. Is it lack of collection from payers, or is it from individuals?","William Sanger","No, it\u2019s more on the commercial side, Ralph, when you look at that. And, look, we just not been pleased with sort of the performance that we've had out of the third-party that we've been utilizing. So really that's what we are addressing. ","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And what is the hang up, is it just not going after and not collecting? Or are there issues around in network, out of network and trying to get a framework of what the issue is, and then your comfort level around changing it, and whether or not it has to get worse before gets better, I guess, at this point?","Randel Owen","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we've been, obviously, analyzing lot of data and looking at that. It\u2019s really more just around we believe the processes and the efforts just have not produced what they say they would produce, and so we've obviously now with that looking at other resources -- other external resources to really come in and help bolster that process and that collection effort. ","And then -- so obviously, we think we will see better realization out of the additional efforts that we've done and also there are -- if for some reasons we don\u2019t hit our ultimate goals, there are other levers we can pull around contractual relationships that we think get these contracts back to proper profitability. ","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And then just on that point, is it the newly acquired, or is it just across the book that you are having some of the challenges?","Randel Owen","Look, it\u2019s not across the book, it\u2019s the selected number of contracts and these are not new contracts. These are contracts that we've had probably -- really in at last year.","William Sanger","These are contracts that are helped by specific billing entities for us.","Randel Owen","Yeah. Yeah. ","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, all right. That's fair. And then, the operating expense line looked like it popped a little bit. I guess, what's the driver there, and is this a new run rate?","Randel Owen","Are you on EmCare or AMR, or both?","Ralph Giacobbe","I'm just talking on total\u2026","Randel Owen","Ralph, part of this is, I would think of from a modeling standpoint, I would sort of use what you see in Q1 is more how you would look at the geography of expense. So for example, on AMR, we said, that with the growth of managed transportation which is really using network providers which we consider operating expense, and using a third-party billing service that we've done for AMR is now an external cost. Those now get glued to operating expense as opposed to internal comp and benefits.","Same thing on EmCare, when you look at the acquisition, there is a slightly different sort of geography of expense between comp and benefits and operating expense. So I would really look at what you see in Q1 in terms of the percent of those components and use that as you sort of model out. ","Ralph Giacobbe","I got you. Just basically a little bit out of comp and benefits expense, a little more in operating expense, and that's the way we should think about it going forward?","Randel Owen","Yeah, that how it goes. ","Ralph Giacobbe","All right. That's helpful. And just the last thing, are you quantifying any of the BPCI spend in general? And then maybe framing, if you could, how much of that or how much opportunity there is to you, ultimately, off of that spend?","William Sanger","Well, we've quantified this, but keep in mind these are very rough numbers. When you look at total universe of our Medicare patients and that our hospitalists treat, is about between $800 million and $900 million. So that's a total universe. ","What we are going after is a fraction of that initially. And so we don\u2019t want to really throw out numbers and what we quantified in terms of what we believe profitability will be in late 2015 or 2016. There is a lot of more work to do. But if you look at what our hospitalists program enjoys today, it\u2019s around between 100 million of Medicare spend that we manage.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks. Just going back to the anesthesiology thing. I assume that this is not a Q1 revenue collection issue, that this is kind of a catch-up over the last several quarters? Is that the way to think about it?","Randel Owen","Well, Kevin, we do plan it to be little more conservative. Probably a little bit of that that relates to the last few months, maybe even before Q1. But then looking at the data, we did decide to obviously lower our expected collection rate based on what we've seen over the last number of months.","So this probably is some of that that's not truly based on units generated in the first quarter, but most of that was looking at our expected realization based on data that we've seen at those contracts. ","Kevin Fischbeck","So when you say that there is remediation, are you talking about on a go-forward basis reducing the run rate purely, or do you mean collecting the 7 on top of reducing? Maybe some portion of that?","Randel Owen","No, What I'm saying is, is you look at -- saying that we've reduced sot of the collection rate that we are recognizing for a revenue standpoint, being able to say, if we are able to get those additional collections that would allow us to then, obviously, increase that realization rate. So that\u2019s one thing. If you just look at it from the collection standpoint.","There are other levers around contractual relationships with hospitals in those services, that depending on how that shakes out, that you might look at with hospitals, whether it involves subsidy or other and the stamping changes around what that revenue stream maybe at those contracts. Most of the other things you would look at depending on sort of that success in what you think you are future run rate is from a revenue standpoint.","Kevin Fischbeck","Yes, I guess coming into the year, you didn't assume that you had this issue. Look at this issue, you see it, you reaffirm guidance. I mean, in your guidance, are you assuming that the $7 million ends up being for the year, $2 million, or you do you assume it ends up being $15 million because you bring it down after time goes on? Just trying to understand how you think about this on an ongoing basis?","Randel Owen","Well, I think, look, there is not a specific number that I would say that if you would look at in the future. I would expect it to be more than 7 just because it doesn\u2019t get fixed in one day. Right? But I don\u2019t expect that to be a hugely material sort of impact to the overall business.","So we do think we can through again different means rectify that in the next few months on those contracts.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, so this is a drag that you foresee this year, but as the year goes on, you collect more and more of it. I assume that you think that ultimately by year end you will be back at the run rate that you thought coming into the year? There's not really a flow-through into next year the way there is this year?","Randel Owen","I think that's a fair way to look at. I think we fully -- we would life-size those contracts with whatever levers we have to do this year. ","Kevin Fischbeck","And then, switching gears to the bundled payment, the way I always thought about these was like the way that we think about a new managed care Medicaid contract or something like that, where there is an investment period before the thing even goes live, that drags down margins.","Then there is going to be at least a 6-month probably to 12-month period where it just takes time to ramp up the volume, to put the medical management initiatives in place, and it's not really until year two, where you would expect it to be really profitable. Again, maybe somewhat of a drag in between then and year two. Is that the right way to think about it? ","I know you talked about 2016, but it sounds like you're saying 2015 is not going to be an issue. So just trying to figure out is that the right way to think about it, 6 to 12 months after implementation before you should expect a contribution, and maybe a little bit of upfront costs, or is there a different timeline around this?","Randel Owen","Well, I think -- you know, that's probably conservative. Most of the protocols, most of the clinical data systems, most of the imperial data has already been developed. Whether that be now the Health Remedy or Evolution Health. These protocols have already been developed. And so it\u2019s not like a lot of work that needs to occur. ","The work that really needs to occur is to work closely with the physicians to monitor utilization and monitor behavior. That really requires more intervention on a one-to-one basis. I don\u2019t see that long of a leg. I don\u2019t believe we were really going to see any real benefit in 2015. We may see some benefit as an industry. But I believe that the real benefit we'll see in 2016. I don\u2019t think it will full year to achieve benefits.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then my last -- I guess, it\u2019s going to be final question, probably a couple of questions in here, is just on the volume number. Because the volume number is on both businesses on a same-store basis were very good, I think better than we've seen from either business in some time.","And trying to understand it, from your view, because it sounds like payer mix improved on EmCare, so maybe reforms adding a little bit there, but it doesn't sound like you think it impacted AMR. So what's really, you think, driving this number? And I think you made a comment earlier that you thought the organic growth was sustainable in both businesses, but that volume number looks pretty high to be sustained, so I wanted to understand that.","William Sanger","Kevin we're not necessarily saying that same-store volume growth needs to sustain at that level. So don\u2019t -- I mean, we are just looking at -- and you look at sort of total revenue growth and whether acquisitions, net new contracts, as well as same-store. So we\u2019d never assume that you\u2019re going to continue to have that kind of volume.","And I think as you've seen the hospitals volumes have been very strong in the quarter, right? So, obviously, heavy flu season, different things, I will agree with you. I don\u2019t know that health reform you saw anything that dramatically change that in the first quarter just from what we've seen in terms of sequentially from the previous quarter.","I think lot of that what we've seen was around flu and sort of other factors that a lot of people saw in the first quarter. ","Randel Owen","Yeah, I think -- Ken, and just to clarify my statements, we don't control same-store growth unfortunately. What we do control is net new contract growth and acquisition growth. And we feel very confident that our net new contract growth in all segments, as well as our acquisitions will continue at the rate that we are seeing now.","Obviously, we did a $0.5 billion acquisition in January, we\u2019re not going to do that every month. But we are going to be really more inquisitive in 2015.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mr. Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.","Andrew Schenker","Thanks. Maybe just to start off on guidance, here. We were always expecting the first quarter to be a little weaker, as you had suggested, as percentage of total revenues, around 19% to 20% because of the payroll tax and the ramping of the acquisitions.","I mean, how should we think about the seasonality of the back half, the next three quarters? Maybe just big pictures here, once the three acquisitions are fully ramped in this quarter, should we be thinking they're fairly similar, or is there other parts or variations in seasonality we should be thinking about?","Randel Owen","No, it does. Andrew, while -- obviously, we have given out and don\u2019t do quarterly, kind of, guidance. When you look at that, remember, so for us this year, for example, even if at EmCare our payroll taxes are almost 18 million higher in the first quarter than they were in the first quarter of 2014. All right? So you have that dynamic.","And so usually that you still have that in the second quarter, not at the same rate, but obviously you start getting past that. And then when you get to the third quarter and fourth quarter, then obviously you see where your payroll taxes are much, much lower in those quarters, really more driven by new starts. Most doctors will have exceeded those cycle limits by, sort of, mid-year. ","So, on that front that's how we think about that. So I do think quarters do sort of increment, I don\u2019t know if I would say ratably, but that wouldn\u2019t be a bad assumption in terms of how you think about that building to sort the annual kind of guidance there. A lot of that is obviously we will see benefit in the second quarter around the acquisitions, where you have the full quarter impact of that. But more of the back half is driven from again sort of continuing growth on the organic side. ","Andrew Schenker","I am just thinking of that -- sorry to follow-up on that one, real quick one. Just thinking about the payroll tax, I mean, obviously that comes in every first quarter, but I guess it's a reflection of the fact that you guys are growing so fast. It's going to be always an increasing pressure point as long as you continue to set high levels of growth. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?","Randel Owen","Yeah. I mean, if you are signing new contracts and then in that case you will have a new legal entity and your FICA taxes are starting over on those new contract starts. Obviously, on the book of business that you have then physicians are typically going to hit that limit some time within the second quarter traditionally.","But you will some of that on the new growth component. That is part of part of sort of that lower margin component when you look at some of those new starts is that payroll fees. But, generally, again, you will see some in Q2 not as much as in Q1 and then obviously Q3 and Q4 is in a much lower number. ","Andrew Schenker","Sure. And on reform real quick, obviously excluding the Medicaid parity, should we be thinking about maybe $4 million benefit on the EmCare side and then maybe $3.5 million to $4 million on the AMR side in the quarter? Is that about right?","Randel Owen","That's fair. It wasn\u2019t dramatically different from what we saw in the fourth quarter. Those sound right. ","Andrew Schenker","And just following up real quick on the last question there. The impact, obviously you highlighted the decline in Medicaid parity as driving the rates down, but could flu have played into that as well creating some pressure? I mean, how is acuity, excluding the parity impact?","Randel Owen","You know, acuity was I think especially early in the quarter was a little lower consistent with what you would think of in terms of higher flu volumes. I think we have seen that more recently pick up some just some of that, you know, and typically seasonality stuff obviously, flu being the primary one of that sort of surprise. ","Andrew Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Your line is open, sir. ","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to go back to reform for a second. Any update just on exchange volumes, have you seen any movement there? And maybe if you could talk specifically about some of the larger states like Texas and Florida, given the enrollment figures look pretty good in those two markets, whether or not you are seeing more volume there than some of your other states?","Randel Owen","Yeah, Whit, we have really -- I don\u2019t know that we have any great data in Q1 around exchange related volumes. We have typically, as we've said before, not seen a lot of that. And, of course, the quarter with a lot of the flu volumes being strong, I don\u2019t know that I would say we have great data to say there was a big jump from exchange standpoint.","So given that we have not seen, there was nothing that sort of stuck out that showed that there was a big step up in exchange pace especially those that may have been uninsured before and then became insured. So we didn\u2019t see any clear data on that piece. ","I don\u2019t know of anything and Bill may have any other comments around when you look at sort of those large states in terms of Texas and Florida there has been different rumbling in those states. But I don\u2019t know anything that we have seen that would tell you there is anything that imminent there. ","Whit Mayo","That's helpful. I guess I can't remember exactly what the disclosure was you gave around exchange volumes. Maybe it was still 1%, 1.5%...","Randel Owen","Yeah, it was less than -- it was like 1% to 1.5%. And so what we have this quarter was fairly similar. ","Whit Mayo","Okay. That's helpful. And just collection rates around the balance after self-pay piece for those products. Has there been any difference between your traditional commercial collection rates? Or you do it on a per contract basis anyway.","Randel Owen","Well, we do it on per contract, but also per payor mix basis by contract. So we get into pretty detail, you know, by payor type by contract. And so, I think there is a little bit of a change there when you get into obviously higher deductible plans and things where there is a higher self-pay component those become part of our self-pay mix, you know, that. So I think you do see and we try to reserve a little bit more on that front. But I wouldn\u2019t say that it was a material -- we have seen a material change, at least from what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. ","Whit Mayo","Okay. That's all I've got. Thanks.","Randel Owen","Hey, thanks, Whit.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Mr. Richard Close of Avondale Partners. Your line is open, sir. ","Richard Close","Yeah, thank you. Two quick questions here. Just curious, with respect to the outsource of the billing on the AMR side, what drove you guys to do that? How is that, I guess, how is that -- the results so far since you outsourced it?","Randel Owen","Look, I think if you look at that -- look a big part of that was the ability to again sort of lower our cost of billing is probably the largest driver, I would say, of that -- other component of that. It\u2019s gone pretty well. There is always transition issues when you do that. But I would that it\u2019s gone pretty well. And I think we feel good about that decision. And we will continue to see as that transition -- because some of that is still on a transition process. We would still anticipate being able to see a lower cost of billing as we go and complete that transition. ","Richard Close","And my last question would be on Vista. You didn't really talk about it here in this call. I wonder how that's progressing and when you might begin to see the benefit maybe in EmCare margins associated with new starts and the temp staffing side of that? ","William Sanger","This is Bill Sanger. Good afternoon. Keep in mind Richard, we didn't close until the latter part of February Vista. So we are just now ramping that relationship us as it relates to temporary staffing for EmCare. We are already beginning to see, you know, as we sit here today the benefits on particularly the hospitalist new starts. So we think over the course of the year we would have be very confident that the second objective of why we moved forward with Vista, and that was to help us with our own increased compensation related to temporary staffing will have a significant effect on the bottom line for us. ","Richard Close","Great. Thank you.","William Sanger","Thank you. ","Operator","At this time, we didn\u2019t have any other questions.","Craig Wilson","Bill, do you want -- anything else you want to say?","William Sanger","There are no other questions, operator, thank you, everyone, now for your interest and following our company. Thank you. ","Randel Owen","Thank you. ","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting today through August 18, 2017. The number for the replay is 719-457-0820, and the code is 4192503.","At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Kneeley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bob Kneeley","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Our presenters today are Chris Holden, CEO and President; and Claire Gulmi, CFO. Also available for the question-and-answer portion of our call are Bob Coward, President of Physician Services; Randy Owen, President of Ambulatory Services; and Kevin Eastridge, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. We encourage you to carefully review the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K filed earlier this year in addition to the risks and uncertainties described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we expect to file in the coming days.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday evening, along with our remarks on this call, are made as of today, August 8, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in the tables included with our press release issued yesterday afternoon, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor@evhc.net. We encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website regularly, which we use to communicate important information regarding Envision Healthcare to investors.","I'll now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Chris Holden. Chris?","Chris Holden","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We have a very full agenda on this morning's call. They cover the announced agreement to divest AMR, our discussion of second quarter operating results and progress on a number of strategic initiatives underway to achieve operating excellence and position our organization as the trusted partner for providers' health systems, patients and payers.","So let me begin with an update on the status of AMR. This morning, we announced our definitive agreement to divest AMR with the sale to KKR and merger with a KKR owned Air Medical transport company. The transaction results in a unique and strategic combination of air and ground transportation providing over 5 billion transports covering 46 states and the District of Columbia. The terms of the transaction are $2.4 billion in cash and is subject only to customary closing conditions. And we expect proceeds to net about $1.9 billion. Closing should occur during the fourth quarter, and we'll assess our capital allocation strategy once we get closer to the closing. This transaction is a significant step, in our vision, of building the new Envision around a set of physician centric clinical solutions to better serve our hospital system and payer clients.","I'm now going to pivot to a discussion of the results for the second quarter. Our second quarter operating results were solid, generally in line with our expectations for the period. EPS was at the top end of the guidance. EBITDA was in line. And importantly, our strong -- we had strong cash flow performance for the quarter.","Of significant note, for Physician Services, on a same-contract basis, our revenue growth was 3.2% overall. And that consisted of volume growth of 1.1% and rate growth of 2.1%. Of particular note, anesthesia volume was positive at 4% for the quarter. In contrast, emergency services volumes declined 0.9% versus prior year and have been flat for the first half of 2007. The rates added 6.4% to the ED same-contract growth in the quarter, fueled by several factors, including in part, our in-network contracting efforts.","Generally, our quarter -- Q1 revised forecast tested well for all service lines in Q2, with the exception of the outlook for ED volumes. And we now have the benefit of several additional data points from hospital providers and 2 full quarters of experience as a combined company to fine-tune our view for the back half of 2017. This issue and its impact on our financials is the exclusive driver of the adjustment to our forecast for the remainder of 2017, and Claire will provide additional color on this point in her remarks.","Additional highlights on our activities during the second quarter include the following. Acquisition activity was robust. We completed 6 physician group practice acquisitions and 2 ASC acquisitions in the quarter. We've now committed over $600 million in development capital this year-to-date and remain confident in our pipeline opportunities for the rest of the year.","We continue to apply a very disciplined strategic set of filters in how we deploy capital for M&A, particularly against this macroeconomic backdrop of utilization pressure that we've seen in the first 2 quarters of the year. So to that end, in April, we made a significant investment in our radiology platform with the acquisition of Imaging Advantage. And we will continue to focus capital in the radiology space, as we believe that we can add value to providers by consolidating this largely fragmented space and we can add value to health systems through the appropriate balance of professional services and technology.","Our strategic filter also includes a focus on building our market relevance in our key markets. In Georgia, we expanded with 2 emergency medicine groups in that state, which complements our recent expansion of anesthesia services in the Atlanta metro area. We also expanded our presence in the Midwest in the State of Wisconsin with the acquisition of Infinity, a multi-specialty group with an emphasis on emergency medicine. Infinity also enhances our strong relationships with Ascension Health, including markets where we provide home health and hospice care in the joint venture with that organization. We continue to expand our ambulatory surgery services through strategic relationships with leading health systems as well.","Now shifting to an update on our migration from out-of-network to in-network status for -- primarily for our emergency services. We believe that progress is moving on our time line and with the expected results. As you may recall, our stated objective is to move the majority of our out-of-network revenue to in-network status within the next 12 to 18 months with a revenue-neutral impact. Year-to-date, we've migrated about 20% of that out-of-network revenue to in-network status. And a significant portion of that early success was in the state of Florida. A significant percentage of the remaining balance is concentrated in a relatively small number of payers. And the impact of adding each contract can create very chunky improvements in our overall percentage. We are actively engaged in positive discussions with that small group, and we remain confident that all parties share collective desire to solve this systemic issue in the best interest of the patient.","As we report this financial update and the milestone of rationalizing our offering portfolio, it's also important to reflect on what we've accomplished in a very brief time. Since our transformational merger last December, we've expanded our partnerships with key health systems. Our results this quarter validate a key element of the transaction, which is the strength of our diversified service offering, which serves to differentiate us both in scale and scope. And we've made substantial progress in each of these following areas, including divesting Medical Transportation, terminating our population health services, consolidating our M&A and sales functions, moving in-network on a significant portion of our emergency medicine business and taking steps to improve our operational excellence across our physician-centric service lines.","We're achieving great accomplishments and despite a more challenging macro environment. And I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of our management team, our advisers and others who've worked so hard and will continue to work hard to build on the market-leading positions that we have for each of our clinical solutions.","And with that introduction, I'll now turn the comments over to Claire Gulmi.","Claire Gulmi","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris said, we're pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2017, which are in line with the guidance issued on our investor call in May. Our organization has made great strides in the past several quarters following completion of the Envision and AMSURG merger. We are on track to achieve our target cost synergies this year, and we're building our new contract pipeline related to revenue synergies, which are expected in the second half of 2018 and through 2019.","As I present this overview of our results for the second quarter, I want to remind you that our income statement discussion is for continuing operations only, while our balance sheet and cash flow discussion is consolidated including both continuing and discontinued operations. In addition, our segment results are impacted by the reallocation of corporate expenses as a result of our decision earlier this year to move Medical Transportation to discontinued ops. For the second quarter, the impact of this reallocation was a reduction of adjusted EBITDA of 6.5 million for Physician Services and 2 million for Ambulatory Services and an increase of $8.5 million for Medical Transportation. I will exclude this reallocation as I present our segment results.","Envision's net revenues from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017 was 1.95 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of 253.8 million is at the midpoint of the guide range of $247 million to $258 million. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 exceeded our range due to lower-than-forecasted interest expense, depreciation and share count. Net earnings per share for continuing operations was $0.42.","Now moving on to Physician Services. Consistent with last quarter, I'll be discussing results for Physician Services as if the merger of legacy AMSURG and Envision had occurred at the start of 2016. By combining historically reported results, it's easier to compare results for the second quarter to the prior year period. Physician Services net revenue was $1.63 billion for the second quarter of '17 and grew by 9.3% from $1.49 billion for the comparable 2016 period. Revenue growth continues to be impacted by the consolidation of a hospital joint venture in the third quarter of 2016 that contributed $42.3 million during the second quarter of 2017.","Revenue growth consisted of contributions from acquisitions of 10.6% and same-contract revenue growth of 2.5%. Revenue from new contracts continued to decline on a net basis largely as a result of a number of underperforming contracts that had been terminated during the third quarter of '16 by legacy Envision. Second quarter revenue from new contracts grew by 5.6%, while revenue associated with contract terminations declined by 7.1%, resulting in a net decline of 1.5% when excluding the population health contract termination. This statistic has improved sequentially, and we expect this will continue to recede over the next several quarters as we lap terminations from the latter part of '16.","On a same-contract basis, revenue growth was 3.2% overall, and that consisted of same-contract volume growth of 1.1% and rate growth of 2.1% during the quarter. While our segment consolidated same-contract growth was in line with our guidance, there was considerable movement in that key service line. Our emergency medicine volumes declined by 0.9% in the second quarter, while EM rate increased by 6.4%. Emergency Medicine rate benefited from integration efforts at large practices that had been acquired in '15 as well as a move to in-network status with several commercial payers in Florida.","Anesthesia went the other way. Volume was strong at 4%, while rate declined by 3.5%. Rate for anesthesia services was lower for several reasons, including a favorable payer settlement that impacted the prior period, a slight increase in the percentage of government payers and slightly lower acuity during the quarter. Commerce rate growth contributed positively to rates for the quarter. And finally, hospitalist volume continues to grow at a faster rate than emergency medicine. Hospitalist medicine is a lower-margin service line and high-volume growth, negatively impacts margin. We have a number of initiatives to improve hospitalist medicine operation and financial performance.","Our same-contract rate and volume data for the second quarter validates one of the rationales for our merger, which is the balance that comes from a diversified services offering. Adjusted EBITDA for Physician Services was $199.8 million when excluding the expense reallocation of $6.5 million, and this compares with $190.5 million for the prior year period. We continue to expect margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year. For our Ambulatory Services segment, revenue was $318.5 million, which was down 0.4% year-over-year, but up 0.8% sequentially.","Second quarter revenue was impacted by $4.7 million related to synergy consolidations that were included in the prior year period. Same center growth of 0.6% consisted of rate growth of 0.5% and 0.1% growth in same center volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $62.5 million excluding the impact of $2 million reallocation of corporate expenses attributable to the ASC segment. This compares to $61.7 million in the prior year. The discontinued ops revenues from AMR was $588.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.7 million when excluding the $8.5 million benefit from expense reallocation. And as we announced this morning, and Chris discussed, we expect to complete the divestiture of AMR this year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $464.6 million of cash at June 30, and this includes $23.3 million of cash attributable to AMR. Total debt was $6.329 billion at June 30. And net debt was $5.864 billion. Our net leverage ratio of 4.5x was up slightly from March 31 as we increased our debt to fund second quarter acquisitions and reduce the amount outstanding on our ABL.","We had very strong cash flow in the second quarter. Cash flow from operations, excluding non-controlling interests and transaction costs, was $236.6 million and that's up significantly on a sequential basis as first quarter cash flows are impacted by the timing of payroll taxes. In the quarter, we had $52 million of maintenance CapEx, including $25 million for AMR. And our acquisition spend for 2017 as of today is $620 million.","Finally, before opening the call for questions, I will make some comments about our guidance updates for 2017. We're adjusting our guidance slightly for the remainder of the year to reflect lower emergency medicine volume than we had forecast in May.","Our revised outlook for '17 includes the following: revenue of $7.75 billion to $8 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.35 to $3.45. We are affirming same-center growth for Ambulatory Services of 0% to 1% and same-contract growth for Physician Services of 3% to 4%. And for the third quarter, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to range from $266 million to $278 million and adjusted EPS of $0.87 to $0.93. We'll continue to deploy our cash and cash flow for M&A in both our Physician Services and ambulatory segments.","And at this time, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from A. J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice","Maybe first, 2 questions, first one on the Physician Services. So you're taking down the back half a little bit for a more modern outlook on emergency room volumes, but you're maintaining your same-store Physician Services target of 3% to 4%. I just wondered how does that adjustment with emergency room work its way through the numbers to end up with what looks like about a $22 million adjustment at the midpoint?","Claire Gulmi","The reason that we're not bringing down the range is because of the mix of services with anesthesia, hospitalists. We're seeing some increase in hospitalist volume that's offsetting the lower statistic on ED. And so that's really how it plays out that once you average all of those statistics, we're still in the 3% to 4% range.","A. J. Rice","But the ED volume is a little more profitable than the hospitalist. Is that why it ends up being an adjustment to EBITDA?","Claire Gulmi","That's exactly right.","A. J. Rice","And then, this is another sort of high-level one. If you think about the updated guidance, I think from third quarter, adjusted EBITDA to fourth -- second to third, then third to fourth, it's about a $20 million step-up each quarter sequentially. Some of that's probably some seasonal factors. Some of it is what's happening with acquisitions. I'm assuming some of it's the way synergies are being realized. There may be something else that I'm not thinking of. Can you give us some sense of why that kind of step-up looks reasonable from second to third, third to fourth and how you -- how we get comfortable with that?","Claire Gulmi","Sure. Well, the third quarter would be impacted by the acquisitions that we closed right at the end of the second quarter. We're also going to realize more cost synergies. And even for the third and fourth, we also see our new contract activity that we've really been aggressively pursuing in the first half of the year begin to have fruition from an EBITDA standpoint. Also, the fourth quarter is seasonally our -- should be our seasonally strongest quarter.","A. J. Rice","That's particularly in the surgery center business, I'm assuming?","Claire Gulmi","Surgery center and really I think in anesthesia and ED. We didn't see it last year as much as we had in the past, but we believe we have an easier comp, too in the fourth quarter, because we had a weak fourth quarter in '16.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tejus Ujjani.","Tejus Ujjani","Just want to go back briefly to Chris' opening remarks regarding the $1.9 billion of proceeds in revisiting capital allocation strategy when the deal closes. Is there any view that the proceeds will not be used to delever or any color you can share there?","Chris Holden","What we've said really from the February when we announced the strategic reviews that we would contemplate at about half and half, 50% of the proceeds, use it towards the pay down of debt and the remainder on our M&A strategy. At this point in time, we're maintaining that view. We have a quarter until we close really and continued time to-- continue to evaluate that. But that's -- we're going to -- we're maintaining our consistent view with -- on that approach at this point.","Tejus Ujjani","Okay. And I know you're asked this a lot and you briefly touched on it, but on your migration of the EM business from out-of-network to in-network on neutral basis, the general implication is it's rate decline offset by volume increase. But I mean, I assume most people in the ER are not calling their insurance to check if they're in-network, et cetera. They're probably just going to the nearest best hospital. So what's mechanically driving your ability to stay revenue-neutral there? Like, are you essentially solving for like a negotiated subsidy from the hospital client to make you whole? Or is this really a 2-way conversation with just the payers?","Chris Holden","There are several factors. First of all, I'm not sure we agree with what you've characterized as a generally accepted view on all of that. But I think we're in a very unique position, given the size and the scale of the organization, the fact that we brought existing contracts into the conversation, the fact that some of the balance billing legislation has also provided us a lot of transparency on what the rates should be and then the fact that I think we have just a very strong contracting infrastructure here and strong leadership, all of those factors have contributed to our ability to solve for a revenue-neutral solution. And I really think that, that's the short answer to your question.","Operator","And will take our next question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Nick Hiller","This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. Just could you provide an update on the Imaging Advantage deal and how you're integrating those assets specifically, some of the telemedicine and remote-read capabilities into the rest of your network?","Chris Holden","Sure. I'll hand that off to Bob Coward.","Robert Coward","Yes, so it's still in early stages, it's only about 3.5, four months since we closed. We've been primarily focusing on onboarding them into our system. And we'll begin the process of assessing how we deploy their remote network across all of our radiology portfolio. Really that's a very long-term process, not something that's easily transitioned overnight as you have to implement technology integrated with your clients and then establish the network and the physician network across that portfolio. So we see that as owned asset, certainly. And that's what we focus on is making sure that it performs as if it's owned asset out of the gate as we integrate it. And then strategically, over the next year, we'll understand and make decisions about how we think we think it can deploy in other areas of our radiology portfolio.","Nick Hiller","Okay. And then switching gears a little over to the contact terminations. Can you remind us what the impact would be for Q3 and Q4? And could the net impact there get to kind of a flat or positive contribution even by the fourth quarter?","Claire Gulmi","It'll still be negative in three. It may begin to even out in four. And certainly, by the first quarter, we would expect it to be positive.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck","I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a bit more color on the added network sizing. I know that you've talked about it from time-to-time at conferences and on the calls. But it would be great to just kind of maybe reset and see if you could give us some numbers about how much revenue maybe at the beginning of the year was kind of in that out-of-network bucket. I think the 20% is a good number to hear, but maybe also get a sense about where that number should be at the end of 2018 when you're kind of through this. I assume you not going to get that down to zero out-of-network revenue. So just something that can give us a little bit better sense as we kind of walk over the next 12 to 18 months and finish this process as to where we are would be helpful.","Chris Holden","Sure, Kevin. I think I've said publicly that it was -- and we've been, I think, the most comprehensive or inclusive in defining out-of-network. We've included rep networks and everything else. We've said, including all of that, it's about 1 billion. We've migrated about 20%, or a little north of that already. We expect that to move the majority of the 1 billion in-network over that remaining 12 to 18 month period that I outlined, and I think you're always going to have maybe 20% or 30% out-of-network. We've actually had some payers through this process in small pockets say -- tell us that they really don't want a contract. It's too small to worry about, and they're happy the way it is.","So like it or not, it is still one of the few tools that the physician universe has for driving dispute resolution with payers who are not reasonable on rates. So you're only going to have some of it, but it has never been a strategy of legacy AMSURG. It's not part of our surgery center business. It's never really been part of the anesthesia business unless there was a legacy share, unless there was a dispute. We've been proactively really since early in this merger trying to be consistent on all of our lines of business that our stated goal is to be in-network.","Kevin Fischbeck","I mean, I guess, I just want to clarify the 20% to 30% out-of-network, that's an ER number, right? You're saying that's well less than that as a percentage.","Chris Holden","That's right. Right. And I think our Physician Services revenues north of $6 billion, so that kind of gives you a context.","Kevin Fischbeck","And I guess, to your point about how -- this is kind of chunky as far as when we'll see this progress happen. Is it -- I mean, I was kind of a little bit surprised to hear that the rates actually were up as far as moving back in-network, which is great to hear. But I guess, is there a view that the easiest conversations happened already and as we get on farther, it's more difficult? Or is there any view about just this all takes time and you don't expect necessarily contract negotiations that happen in 12 months from now to be that much different than ones that are happening today?","Chris Holden","No, that's not really the view. I mean, I'm sure for those that are not privy to the inside baseball of how this process works, there are probably a lot of different theories about how it might be viewed. But the reality is the ones that we accomplished earlier were smaller. These other conversations are much larger and on a more national scale. And neither side is really pushing back. It's just complex to navigate that across a national platform as opposed to a state-level conversation. And also, as you know, we reengineered the population health management relationship with Blue Cross of Florida that led to an obvious resolution there. So that's -- it's really the complexity that drives it, not anything else.","Kevin Fischbeck","And then, I guess, this is the last question. I guess in the past, when we think about out-of-network, we generally think about a wide range of pricing between the contracted rate and what you might get from being out-of-network. I think in the past, you've talked about that number probably being a lot more narrow than we would normally think about it. Any color you can provide there about why that is and how to think about that?","Chris Holden","Well, I think there's been a dramatic change in the reimbursement in the last two to three years, driven in part by a planned design, payers shifting more responsibility on to the patients, all of those different factors, which has migrated the net, we call it, the collection per visit down to a certain level. And then you balance that against the fact that these state legislation initiatives, the balanced billing initiatives have for the first time provided some transparency to the payer on what their rate would look like and what they're going to be held accountable to. So you have the coalition of those two forces.","And then once we could compare that to what we currently had in our contracted rates, they all leveled out. So it really took some of the mystery out of the conversation, and again, I think leads to why everybody's committed to moving down this pathway. We all know, whether it's payers, large employers, health systems or physician provider organizations that out-of-network is a dis-satisfier, and we're all committed to correcting that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just want to stay on the pricing stat, particularly on the ED side, obviously, strong at the 6.4%. And you did mention sort of the in-network efforts, obviously. Anything else driving that, maybe acuity mix, just given sort of the softer volume there? And then maybe just more broadly, seeing anesthesia rate down and ED up, you certainly talked about a holistic approach to contracting and some rationale of why you expect out-of-network to in-network to kind of be net-neutral. Is that the dynamic at play here, where maybe pricing is up on the ED, but anesthesia is down, net effect is kind of that plus 2-ish percent on the pricing stat and that's how we should expect it on a go-forward basis?","Chris Holden","It's a good question. I want to be very clear. This is not a matter of trading one-off for the other. They're 2 very different phenomena that impacted the quarter. Claire covered it in her comments, but I think we're -- and it's worth revisiting what drove the rate in both anesthesia and in ED.","Claire Gulmi","Sure. And I think that the anesthesia rate was, obviously, driven lower by prior periods' favorable adjustment we had with the settlement of the payers. So it's kind of an anomaly. So we're not expecting -- that will not continue. And then we had slightly lower government payer and slightly lower acuity, and those can vary from quarter-to-quarter. I don't think we would expect that we would see negative rate on anesthesia for the remainder of the year. And in ED, we talked about it being driven by some prior year acquisitions where we're getting better yield on our services and by the going in-network with in Florida.","Ralph Giacobbe","And then maybe just a follow-up on any more color you can give on the payer mix on the anesthesia side? Well, how many basis points shifted? And then maybe just talk about that business more broadly. MEDNAX recently talked about retrenching a bit, specifically for M&A. I guess, just your general thoughts and intentions there.","Chris Holden","We were -- let me just start with the view of the business. We remain very bullish on anesthesia. Hats off to Bob Coward, and sheared, and Bob hasn't been there the entire time, but we've been providing anesthesia services for 60 years, and we feel like we're well positioned there and bring a degree of operational excellence that is really the standard-bearer today. And we would -- we look forward to continuing to grow that business. And I'll let Claire weigh in.","Claire Gulmi","We had about a 70 basis point movement from commercial to government payers and about 60 basis points in lower acuity for the quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","I know you touched on the effects of the out-of-network strategy on pricing. But I'm just curious, on that piece of business that converted, are you seeing any change in collections? And you called out strong cash flow in the quarter. Was there a drop in DSO or increasing cash collections as a result of that move to in-network? And then my second question is just on the acquisition outlook. You've made some comments earlier there, but do you expect the mix of those acquisitions to change in any way, maybe more towards some of the higher-margin anesthesia or radiology services?","Claire Gulmi","Just to address the DSOs, now like Chris talked about the acquisitions, but DSOs really were unchanged from the first quarter, 70 days on the Physician Services side and 33 on the ASC side.","Chris Holden","I think it's probably too early to call on that. It takes a while for the cash flow to work its way through. And once you go in-network, what we do expect that long term -- and Frank, what was the second part of your question?","Frank Morgan","Let me finish that one. Could you give us some kind of general framework of how much you would think collection rates would improve? I mean, would it be enough to move the needle? And then yes, the second question was just on your acquisition pipeline and outlook. It sounds like nothing's really changed much there in terms of the dollars you want to allocate. But in terms of just the mix of businesses you're looking to go towards maybe the higher margin or is it the same mix? That's it.","Chris Holden","I got you.","Claire Gulmi","Well, I think as far as the rate on the going in-network, I think we've been very consistent that we expect it to be revenue-neutral. There will be pluses and minuses as we go through this next year. But we expect it -- we had a positive impact in the second quarter. But again, we'll have pluses and minuses. So I would not forecast any great improvement.","Chris Holden","They were asking me also about whether days would go down.","Claire Gulmi","Yes, and I think because you're in-network, it should make it much easier to collect both from the payer and the patient. So I think over time, we would expect to see the DSOs in Physician Services to go down. I think we've got a pretty stellar record in the ASC side. So I hope that there'll be a change there.","Chris Holden","I think on the mix of M&A, I don't really foresee a change in that mix driven by any of these issues. It remains very opportunistic in terms of what's coming to market. I think the one takeaway is that we are bullish on the -- certainly, the big 3, radiology, ED and anesthesia are top of mind for us. And we really are agnostic as to any of those 3 coming to the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.","Benjamin Mayo","Chris, I'm just curious on the ED business. Volumes appear to be kind of gone everywhere based off of the reports from others. Payers are talking incrementally about strategies around this. There are changes in the prudent layperson rule that is probably a different conversation altogether. But I'm just curious on your thoughts around the growth prospects for ER business going forward. And I guess the question really is from a high level, how structural or cyclical do you think this trend is?","Chris Holden","That's a great question. That's something we did a lot of homework on going into the merger. And obviously, we remain bullish on the outlook for the space. I'll begin with the observation that there's -- there are really a limited number of primary care providers in this country, whether it's your family practitioner, internist, urgent care or ED. So as a country, we're limited on the portals for access. The care and emergency rooms are certainly a key part of the fabric of that part of the delivery system.","You saw in Massachusetts, when they implemented their health care reform, which was intended to drive primary care out of the emergency rooms, the utilization actually went up. I think we saw a little bit of that through the expansion of the ACA. I think some of the urgent care and freestanding EDs and other modalities are not new to the system. They've been expanding for quite some time, and ED volumes continue to go up. And I think we're always going to have a situation in this country where demand will outstrip supply for quite some time and will leave the EDs well positioned.","I do think that it calls for making sure we align with the market-leading health systems and partners. It will also become an exercise in share-taking here. And part of our thesis is, by providing the top-of-the-line physician component to support what the health systems are doing to create their brand will also drive growth long term. And you see that embedded in part of our strategy. So the long answer to your question, I think we're well positioned and that there will be growth there either organically or by taking share. I do think that we may continue to see a growth in the acuity through the emergency rooms too, which is an offset to whatever happens with the volume. So all that said, we feel very bullish on the outlook and the profile of the growth side of that business.","Benjamin Mayo","So you would just simply say we're just cycling through a soft patch right now. Is that the house view?","Chris Holden","I've said for a long time, we're coming through the backside of a very strong three year window where we insured another 20 plus million people. Parity tailed out. You had so many different extraordinary tailwinds. It just makes sense that you had to have some type of reset through that process, but that will normalize. I think that we'll come out the other side and we'll go back to maybe what we saw pre-2015, which as you recall, is sort of how we set our initial model when we did the merger.","Benjamin Mayo","Makes sense. And maybe just on anesthesia, I heard you cite government mix. Did you reference commercial mix? And maybe just any comments on exchange enrollment? I mean, you've got so much concentration in Florida. I don't think you're necessarily seeking enrollment down across your markets. Just any high-level thoughts.","Claire Gulmi","Sure. We did have positive results from commercial. Within that, though -- and we consider the exchange as commercial. We did have some decline, not in exchange volume, but a movement from a higher-paying exchange payer to a lower-paying exchange payer. We have a couple of payers that have left the Florida market. And so it did, it negatively impacted the overall commercial volume, but overall commercial rate was positive.","Benjamin Mayo","Yes -- no, I bought you. And maybe just one last one maybe for Chris just on the new contract growth in the quarter. Is there any way to parse out how much of that is coming from systems where you have a current relationship and just look at for any way to track your progress in cross-selling and how that's meeting your expectation?","Chris Holden","Yes, we're well ahead of pace on total contracts, and about 76% of that are with systems. We think we have an existing -- at least one existing service in their system.","Benjamin Mayo","How was that if that was back a year ago? What would that percentage be for your -- I guess, your legacy business? Or is that not now a statistic?","Chris Holden","Yes, I don't know that. That was even on the radar to track a year ago is the truth. And nor am I married to that particular statistic. I mean, we track it now, because we want to really prove to ourselves internally that we have the confidence and trust of our health system relationships. And I think it's showing that, but we also want to grow outside our existing relationships long term.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Chris, just wanted to ask you on the cross-sell, obviously, it was one of the thesis points for doing the deal. Do you mind just giving us some color on the traction you're getting when your health system partner from your current client in terms of getting the cross-sell done?","Chris Holden","As I just mentioned, about 76% of all of our new contracts and year-to-date have been with systems within we have an existing relationship with at least one service. So we really feel like that's an indicator for us, plus the fact that our new sales efforts are tracking according to plan. So we feel very good about that. It's still early. We're still very much engaged in what we view as an educational process with our health system partners, designed to really encourage them to think strategically about the Physician Services and the surgery center platform and how we can be proactive in working together instead of having to respond to crises. It's much less expensive and far less disruptive to be proactive and not responding to the crisis of the day. So that's really been the focus of the conversation. And we've gotten tremendous response to that.","Brian Tanquilut","And then in terms of -- you mentioned the new contract success so far year-to-date. Are there any things to call out in terms of new exits on the flip side of that? Or are we just waiting to anniversary the exits from the last year?","Claire Gulmi","We are primarily waiting to anniversary. I think we do. I think we have accelerated the new contract process, but it's primarily the anniversary-ing of the terminations.","Brian Tanquilut","And then last question from me. As we think about M&A, we've seen a couple of private equity deals in the ASC space, Bain Capital and KKR coming in. So what are your thoughts in terms of deal flow and ASPs and capital allocation in that space and also valuation for ASC at this point?","Chris Holden","Honestly, we're about as well positioned as we've ever been. Particularly on the M&A front, we really stand out as uniquely positioned against the backdrop of our competitors. Two are hospital owned. One is payer-owned. And one is recently involved in a significant private equity transaction, which is -- I'm sure is taking all their time on integration and also left them highly levered. So we look very unique compared to that set of choices. Our pipeline is double the size it was a year ago. I think we're very attractive to that large group of independent ASCs that are out there looking for a partner.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Most of my questions have been answered. I've just had 2 technical ones left. The first is when I look at the reported $253.8 million of EBITDA and look at the reconciliation to get to that number on Page 6, it does seem to not add back the $5.8 million loss on the disposition and deconsolidation. Or in other words, that debt loss seems to be included in the EBITDA. So if we excluded that, we'd be closer to $260 million. So was there something else that offset that you didn't want to call it a $260 million EBITDA number?","Kevin Eastridge","Sure. Gary, this is Kevin. I'll try to answer that for you. The gain and loss on the scope of the deconsolidation includes several transactions, both gains and losses and primarily losses on disposal of 3 centers. And those losses are recorded at the partnership level. So therefore, there's a component that on the face of the financials, that is a gross amount. But the minority interest holders share a portion of those losses. And that portion is down and reflected down in the NCI. So for consolidation purposes, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to add back the full amount of the gain win. A portion of that was shared by the minority interest holders. And it just so happened that for the most part, it wiped out the balance of that gain or loss.","Gary Taylor ","Okay, that makes sense. And then my second one is, when we look at the terminated revenue, 9.4% of headwind from terminated contracts excluding Evolution of population health. That's about $167 million, as I figure it, quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much EBITDA you're expecting as well? I presume, those are, obviously, lower margin. But are those breakeven? Are those losses? Are those positive low single-digit margins? Is there some EBITDA that -- headwind as well and not just revenue headwind?","Claire Gulmi","There's always a few contracts that you move, I mean, buried in there that has positive EBITDA margins. But the big bolus of contracts that were terminated in the fall of '16 had in total negative EBITDA or just slightly negative EBITDA. And of course, the big Evolution contract was negative too. So it's all accretive to us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom","I have 3 or 4 from here from my end. First question, you guys have retained some home health revenue from your Evolution purchase. Could you just -- I don't think I've ever heard you talk about that. But have you been able to get your arms around at least at all this grouper's model or did you give any thoughts to any strategic plans for that business you plan to hang on to it? Or is that something that will go with everything else?","Chris Holden","I'm going to turn it over to Randy. Go ahead.","Randel Owen","First, when you look at the changes in the home health reimbursement, we really don't think there'll be a big change. Obviously, there's a lot to happen here in terms of before anything becomes effective. But our business, which is largely about 2\/3 of it's really what the Ascension joint venture that's a part of the home health, a lot of it really does come from facility referral. It's really not therapy-intensive. So we really don't see any impact at this point from changes in the groupings, et cetera. So I think that's a fairly small and unknown impact at this point.","Chris Holden","We do like the business. Our goal is to continue to be in that. It's a -- I think it's a growing area, high demand. And it does have a nexus between our post-acute -- our hospitalist and post-acute continuum. So we will continue to explore that business.","John Ransom","Okay. Kind of moving on to a couple of other things. I think I've heard you say in the past that part of the emphasis to go in-network on ER is the fact that the reimbursement from the payers has gotten tougher over the past several years and you're having to collect more and more from the patients. So Chris, all kind of issues? Is there any way you could put any sort of number around that, like your average out-of-network payment as kind of like-for-like has dropped by x percent or y dollars? Is there any way to think about that?","Chris Holden","John, the only way I've been able to couch it is that, that rate is consistent with what we've been able to contract for them. The shared inside prior to the merger, it's just sort of -- I guess, it's all -- really best way to say, it's kind of normalized out to a fairly consistent rate.","John Ransom","And is your patient co-pay collection better on in-network or is it about the same?","Claire Gulmi","No. We would expect it to be better on in-network. Yes.","John Ransom","Yes, at a high level, I would think a $200 bill versus a $14,000 bill might -- would put them in a better mood to pay you. That's my...","Claire Gulmi","Well, it's also the portion that's due from the patient is smaller, even if the total bill is smaller, smaller from the patient.","John Ransom","Okay. Thirdly, I know your guidance was that you're running M&A at about an 8 multiple -- acquired multiple. You've spent over $600 million to date. As we think about modeling, is an 8 multiple a pretty good placeholder?","Chris Holden","It is.","John Ransom","And where do you try to get that multiple lever in 2 to 3 years?","Chris Holden","The effect of the multiple is 8 or less is really our goal.","John Ransom","But is that out of the gate or is that down the road after you work on it for a bit?","Chris Holden","That's a synergized multiple.","Claire Gulmi","Usually within the first year.","Chris Holden","It doesn't take too long.","John Ransom","Okay. And then demonstrating my grasp of Econ 101, I would assume that you've got more sellers and fewer buyers. Are you starting to see as a forward-looking indicator that maybe anesthesia groups aren't going to go for 147 times EBITDA. Is there any daylight on the multiples coming down?","Chris Holden","No, John, that's a great point. I have been shocked at the disconnect between activity and valuation levels in the public versus the private market. The private market is far more bullish than the public markets are on health care and the valuations for where these services are headed.","John Ransom","Yes, all right. And just last two from me. The hot topic, obviously, does your -- is the negative leverage in anesthesia, if mixed shift goes against you because of the big disconnect between government and private pay rates, any hypothetical scenario where it may go against you? Do you have levers to pull to manage the EBITDA hit? Or is it going to be disproportionate just because of high fixed cost and not many levers to pull?","Chris Holden","Let me turn it over to Bob. He's been doing it for 127 years, so we'll let him answer the question.","Robert Coward","Yes, I wouldn't want to misrepresent it and say that dollar-for-dollar, we can react to a rate degradation. But there is clearly within how we operate the service line a material amount of what we would call variable compensation with our providers. And that can increase or decrease based on the overall performance of a contract. So there is some risk sharing to the upside and the downside that we have with our providers. And then we also have to just manage through the cycle, this is the world we live in, going through cycles in health care, whether it's the macro environment on rate or the labor environment. And you just find a way to manage through it, working through what your per diem labor force is and use of per diem labor and tightening up utilization of providers and the management of ORs and trying to manage through that EBITDA from downs of the cycle.","Chris Holden","I think we have a couple of benefits. We do own our own staffing services company that help support that. We also have the benefit of some geographic synergies where we can share staff within the geographies where others may not be able to do that. And I do think that 60 years of doing it, you develop systems and procedures that do give you a little more flexibility. But I think as Bob said there, all of the services, there is a floor.","John Ransom","No. I mean, I know this is getting into something that's more complicated than what I'm making it. But in general, have you owned these practices long enough where the docs are sort of well into their kind of bonus qualifying. So if it goes against you a little bit, you're not just -- they're not all on fixed salary and you had known them long enough to qualify not past their earned bonus? Or is it just more structural in terms of that pool, kind of variable comp pool approach? That's probably the number one question I get, and I'll be darned if I know how to give somebody a simple answer to that.","Chris Holden","Well, I never really start out with a business thinking about the fact that I own the doctors. So I think really the company is built on relationships that have come through a whole variety of methods, through very robust intense, organic efforts to grow the company as well as acquisitive. And I think what we try to do is balance out across the portfolio. Like I said, there is some form of variable compensation that keeps these doctors engaged and aligned with the company. And through today, there will be millions of dollars that we pay out in 2017 to our providers across our different bonus plans that we have.","John Ransom","Okay. And then just lastly, Chris, going back to ER. Do you feel the emphasis down the road to own the lower cost points of care like a doc-in-a-box type company? Or do you think you can go at it with just the ER? And do you think freestanding ER is something that you need to step on the accelerator? Or do you think your current model will suffice?","Chris Holden","I'd have to speak to each one of those on a case-by-case basis. We've really only experimented with pilots and staffing freestanding ED or urgent care where the customer and the health system customer has asked us to participate there. I think big picture, we see so much opportunity in the core businesses, we're not really that motivated to expand beyond what we're currently doing today. It's just an incredibly large and fragmented universe in front of us, and that's where we're going to remain focused in the near term.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Holden for closing remarks.","Chris Holden","All right. Well, thank you, operator. I'm going to end by thanking all those involved, particularly in the AMR transaction that was announced today. It took literally hundreds and thousands of people to make that -- bring it to where we are today. Also I'd like to end by thanking my board for all of their support on shaping this strategy and moving the organization quickly on the path of transformation that we've accomplished in really a relatively short period of time.","With that, operator, I'll end my comments and thank everyone for joining us on the call today.","Operator","And this concludes today's call.

The number for the replay is 719-457-0820 and the code is 6208739.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Kneeley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.","Robert Kneeley - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, Cynthia, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Envision Healthcare's earnings conference call for the full year and quarter ended December 31, 2016. Our presenters today are Chris Holden, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Claire Gulmi, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on today's call are Bob Coward, President of our Physician Services Group; and Randy Owen, President of Ambulatory Services Group.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some information provided during this call may be included \u2013 it may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings, and actual results may vary materially. We encourage you to review the Risk Factors section of our filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed later this week.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued this afternoon, along with our remarks on this call, are made as of today, February 28, and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.","Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.

All comparisons included in our presentation today are for the 2016 period to the comparable period in 2015, unless otherwise noted.","I'll now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Chris Holden. Chris?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Bob. So as most of you know, this marks the first investor call for Envision Healthcare since completing the merger with AmSurg Corp. Our transformational merger was completed on December 1, 2016, and I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire team, and in particular our finance team under Claire Gulmi's leadership, for their outstanding work in preparing for this merger and for this conversation here today. We are all energized by the strength of this combination and the spirit of collaboration that defines our new organization.","There are three key topics I'd like to address on this call today, and they include, first, an update on the status of our integration; second, a high level assessment of Q4 operating results along with our outlook for 2017, and finally, after Claire's comments, an update on our strategic plan. Let me begin by providing a brief report on our integration effort.","Our board is now aligned and in sync with our forward-looking vision. We've communicated our refreshed mission, vision and values throughout the organization. Our formal organizational design is now in place, and the leadership is aligned. Compensation and benefits have been harmonized. Budgets and performance goals are now in place. The sales and development teams are consolidated and working in concert, and we are executing our synergy action plan and expect to meet the $35 million run rate targeted in 2017.","The bulk of the remaining integration work is focused on Physician Services, and Bob Coward, President of the Physician Services Group, is leading that integration process and has received strong support from physician leaders from all legacy service lines. So, I get questions on whether there have been any surprises in this merger, and I'd like to share a few of the remarkable positive observations.","The overall executive talent and leadership in this combined organization confirms my confidence in our ability to execute. The talent dovetailed nicely for both organizations and made us stronger than (6:44) of the parts. The sales team has gotten off to a fast start with our relationship selling efforts, and the merger has significantly accelerated our communication at the highest levels within major health systems.","Prior to the merger, about 68% of the contracts we won in legacy AMSURG Physician Services last year were through relationship sell, meaning we already had a relationship with that system or a hospital with at least one service line offering. Throughout the first part of this year, 91% of our contract wins for new Envision Physician Services are relationship sells, and we're ahead of pace for new contract wins through February. We've had very positive engagement with most of the leading managed care organizations. We are focused on moving the majority of our relationships to in-network status. We think this is a strategic priority for new Envision and we believe this to be a net positive shift in policy with significant strategic benefits.","The depth of our M&A pipeline of opportunities continues to be robust and compelling. We remain confident in the pipeline and our ability to put the free cash flow to work, and note that in Q4 we invested $42 million, and year-to-date we've closed over $70 million in transactions. And we reaffirm our strategic intent to deploy the bulk of our capital to expand our positions in key markets and key service lines, and the majority of the capital will be focused on Physician Services. The pipeline remains strong and we remain disciplined in sourcing and vetting the right opportunities.","On the more challenging front, closing the deal in December created a timing challenge in closing out 2016 and preparing for 2017. The short timeline to prepare the necessary SEC filings, budgets, guidance and the strategic review process, added a significant degree of complexity to our launch. Macro utilization trends were the obvious concern in Q4. They were much lower than anticipated, and Claire and I will cover that in more detail shortly.","And finally, the Rural\/Metro transaction does continue to lag projections, and while we think the strategic rationale for that deal is solid, it's been a struggle to achieve the projected run rate. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress of our integration.","So now I'm going to shift my comments to Q4 and the outlook for 2017. Please note the new Envision will be reporting results for three business segments; one, Physician Services, which does include Evolution Health; two, Patient Transportation; and three, Ambulatory Surgery.","Our press release includes the highlights for legacy AMSURG's Q4 and the full year 2016 as well. Results for the quarter are unusually noisy for several reasons. We have only one month of legacy Envision results in the quarter, and there are significant merger-related expenses and adjustments. As a result, benchmarking performance is difficult without a common point of reference. To solve for that issue, much of our comparative discussion will reference the model set forth in our proxy filed in June of 2016, which we will generally refer to here as the proxy model. Overall, Q4 results for annual adjusted EBITDA were approximately 5% below the proxy model.","The primary driver of the variance was softer than modeled same-contract volume. The volume softness was across all service lines. Q4 actual results reflected approximately a 200-basis point shortfall versus modeled expectations, and accounts for over 50% of the variance to model. Volumes are generally in line with budgeted expectations through mid-February. It's important to recognize volume sensitivity in the model. With projected combined revenue of almost $10 billion, a 1% shift in same-contract metrics can have an $80 million to $100 million annual impact.","So shifting now to the outlook for 2017, let me begin with a few important takeaways. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the revised outlook is very consistent with the proxy model and is in the mid-teens. The revised outlook for adjusted EBITDA is approximately 6% below the adjusted EBITDA highlighted in the proxy model. The various versus the proxy model is driven by two key factors. One, we're starting from a lower base in 2016 based on the actual results, or approximately $68 million below our proxy model. And we also modeled a slight downward adjustment to the same-contract growth assumptions. Same-contract growth assumptions for 2017 have been adjusted downward approximately 50 basis points compared to the proxy model.","The decision to modify our assumptions is simply an extrapolation of the soft utilization experienced in Q4, coupled with a sensitivity to very high comparable growth rates in the first half of 2017, particularly in Physician Services. Overall, we remain very bullish on the outlook for new Envision Healthcare, and have confidence that as a team, we can execute on our plan, and Claire will provide more color on the reconciliation for Q4 and the revised model for 2017.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Claire.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris discussed, our financial results for the fourth quarter include one month of legacy Envision results and include several one-time charges related to the merger. I will highlight our reported financial results and then discuss operational results for both legacy AMSURG and Envision in order to give a clearer picture of performance for the full year. In addition, I will compare 2016 operating results with our 2017 guidance through the projection included in the proxy statement we initially filed in June of 2016.","For the quarter, revenues for the quarter were $1.391 billion. We recorded an impairment charge of $221 million, primarily related to the sunsetting of the Sheridan brand name. We also recorded $56.6 million in transaction and integration costs, $40.3 million in debt extinguishment costs and $5.5 million in purchase accounting adjustments.","These one-time costs resulted in a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter of $137.8 million and a net loss per common share of $1.84. Our adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $92 million, and our adjusted net earnings per share was $1.15 on diluted shares of 80,000,099. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $208.7 million. Legacy Envision contributed $57 million for the one month that they were included in these results.","Our net operating cash flow, less distributions to non-controlling interests and before transaction costs, was $98.6 million. For the full year, our revenues were $3.696 billion. Our net loss attributable to common shareholders was $27.7 million, and our net loss per common share was $0.47. Adjusted net earnings were $266.7 million, and adjusted net earnings per share was $4.23. This adjusted net earnings per share included $0.07 of dilution due to the merger. Adjusted EBITDA was $631 million. Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $394 million for the year, as we completed 11 physician practice acquisitions and seven surgery center acquisitions. Maintenance CapEx was $97.5 million for the year.","Our net operating cash flow, less distributions to non-controlling interests and transaction costs, was $293 million. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $332 million and our total debt was $5.95 billion and our pro forma debt to EBITDA leverage was 4.3 times. Both the quarter and annual adjusted EPS results were favorably impacted $0.14 and $0.17, respectively, from a lower tax rate due to state tax planning strategies executed in the fourth quarter.","Now, I will discuss legacy AMSURG results for the quarter and for the year by segment. For the full year, legacy AMSURG's adjusted EBITDA was $574 million, which was $19 million below the EBITDA in our proxy. This variance was driven primarily by softer anesthesia volumes and revenue in Physician Services during the fourth quarter. For our Physician Services segment, net revenue for the quarter was $518 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 34.3%, same-contract revenue contributed 0.8%, and net new contracts contributed 1.9%.","Adjusted EBITDA was $87.5 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, and the EBITDA margin was 16.9%. Excluding the JV consolidation, which began in the third quarter of 2016, the EBITDA margin would have been 18.3%, which is 130 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. The adjusted EBITDA was $18 million below our original forecast for the fourth quarter.","Several items contributed to this variance. For the quarter, same-contract volumes were almost flat, at a 0.3% increase, and revenue per encounter increased 2%, substantially below the growth rate seen in prior quarters. This lower revenue growth contributed $13 million to the $18 million quarterly variance. Approximately $2 million was due to the impact of the hurricane in October, $7 million from softer surgical volumes primarily in Florida and $4 million from payor mix shift.","The remaining $5 million variance from forecast was due to higher expenses in our revenue cycle management department. We are migrating many of our 2015 and 2016 acquired practices onto our billing platform, which has increased our RCM expense as we work through this transition. In addition, this migration process has resulted in an increased DSO of approximately seven days in the quarter, impacting our cash flow for the quarter.","In our ASC segment, ASC revenues were $326.7 million. Revenue growth continues to be impacted by current and prior year deconsolidation and the impact of one less day in the quarter versus the prior year. Day-adjusted same-center revenues increased 3.4% during the quarter, procedures increased 0.6% and net revenue per procedure increased 2.8%. Adjusted EBITDA was $63.6 million and our EBITDA margin was 19.5%. This adjusted EBITDA was $1 million below our forecast due to slightly lower volumes than forecast in the fourth quarter.","Now, I'll discuss legacy Envision results. The results discussed will exclude merger costs and any opening balance sheet adjustment items. Our June proxy forecasted Envision EBITDA of $710 million for the year. Excluding the items I just mentioned, Envision EBITDA was $661 million, $49 million below the forecast due to the fourth quarter results. A summary of these variances from forecast by segment is as follows.","EmCare results were $21 million below forecast. $14 million of the variance was due to lower same-contract volumes, which were approximately 2% below forecast. Actual same-contract revenue for the quarter was 6.1%, 2.7% from volume and 3.4% from revenue per encounter. Emergency service volumes increased 1.5% for the quarter as we continued to see softer volume growth with hospitals volumes up 10.3% for the quarter. The remaining $7 million variance from forecast was driven by higher physician compensation and benefits in certain areas. Specifically, productivity bonuses were higher than planned at a number of sites with revenue-based comp plans as well as higher use of locum tenens at some sites.","AMR results were $18 million below forecast. Same-contract revenue was 3.7% for the quarter with volumes increasing 1.7% and revenue per encounter increasing 2%. Lower than forecasted volumes contributed $4 million to the operational variance with most of the volume miss at Rural\/Metro locations. $10 million of the variance was due to lower revenue per encounter, primarily due to increased contractual and bad debt allowances based on current cash collection trends. The remaining $4 million variance from forecast was from increased auto liability and health insurance expense based on recent claim trends.","Evolution results were $10 million below forecast. $6 million of this variance was from an increase in contractual and bad debt allowances, $2 million from lower than forecasted new business during the quarter and $2 million from higher claims in the Florida Blue Cross contract. In summary, our 2016 projected results for the combined company was $68 million below the forecast included in our June proxy statement.","Now, as we look through our guidance for 2017, I want to highlight the variance in today's adjusted EBITDA guidance to the forecast in the proxy. In the proxy, we forecasted a combined 2007 (sic) [2017] (21:09) EBITDA before synergies of $1.489 billion. I just discussed that our 2016 EBITDA results were $68 million below our forecast, giving us a lower base to grow from than was anticipated in the proxy. In addition, we are reducing our same-contract revenue guidance in the Physician Services division to reflect the softness in volumes that we saw in emergency services and anesthesia during the quarter and the lower same-contract revenue experienced at AMR. A 1% reduction in same-contract revenue across these service lines negatively impacts revenue by approximately $65 million.","Net new contract growth estimates for Physician Services for 2017 includes the impact of the relatively higher rate of contract terminations that occurred at EmCare in the prior year. This was largely a product of (22:09) the portfolio of underperforming contracts, although it does include some mature contracts that were performing to expectations. For all of 2016, these terminated contracts in total operated at a slight loss. This will be a drag to organic revenue growth of about 1% to 2%, but these contracts are not a major factor in the adjusted EBITDA projected for 2017 relative to our initial model.","Our EPS guidance for 2017 is impacted by the variances I just described and in addition, depreciation expense will be approximately $0.17 higher than our original expectations due in part to recent IT infrastructure investments in the Physician Services segment, as well as the impact of increased tangible (22:58) asset values as a result of purchase accounting. Also, our interest expense will be approximately $0.12 higher than original expectations due to the impact of the composition of our current capital structure as compared to our original forecast.","With these adjustments to the forecast in mind, today we are establishing full year 2017 and first quarter 2017 guidance as follows. This guidance will include \u2013 does include acquisition spend for the full year of $900 million. Annual revenues of $10.41 billion to $10.71 billion, same set of (23:35) revenue increase of 2% to 3% for Ambulatory Services, same-contract revenue growth of 3% to 4% for Physician Services and same-contract revenue for Medical Transportation of 2% to 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.365 billion to $1.415 billion, adjusted EPS in a range of $4.06 to $4.31, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $280 million to $291 million and adjusted EPS for the first quarter in a range of $0.75 to $0.81.","Now, I'd like to turn this back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, Claire. So, we've discussed integration, Q4 and the outlook for 2017. So, now let me shift the conversation to our final topic, an update on our strategic plan. As I shared publicly post closing, are committed to the board that the management team would guide them through an analysis of our business segments and the purpose of that exercise is to align our vision with shareholder value and determine the best and highest use of our human talent and financial capital.","So, here are the key takeaways from that board process. So, in our press release this afternoon, we are announcing we will explore strategic options and alternatives for AMR and the population health services offered under the offices (25:01) of Evolution Health. These options range from any number of alternative structures, including joint ventures, partnerships and even divestiture. We're not ruling out the possibility of continuing to operate these businesses under Envision.","We believe we have tremendous optionality and we plan to use the next few months to refine our choices. Ultimately, we expect to resolve the strategic positioning of these service lines by year end. The key message is the board and the management are in sync on this pathway.","We do expect to retain the physician-centric services associated with Evolution Health, including home health and hospice, given their importance to our partner relationships with health systems such as Ascension Health. We feel it's a valid use of management's time and energy to determine whether there is value in rationalizing the portfolio in a way that encourages focus, particularly on the physician-centric enterprises, enhances operational and customer alignment, even potentially reduces our leverage. The next stage of our process will allow us to vet this thesis and take action accordingly.","So, why explore options for AMR and the population health component of Evolution, specifically? So, let me start with AMR. First, let me say that the business model and the leadership at AMR are exceptional. We believe AMR is a great business with opportunities to grow and expand. The issue is really quite simple. It's whether combining patient transportation into a provider services company artificially dilutes shareholder value. There is an argument that it does, driven in part by the lack of comparables as well as the capital intensity of the business. Whether that's a fair thesis or not is something we'll continue to test as we explore alternatives.","For the population management component of Evolution Health, we remain convinced that managed care innovation must be a core competency for our organization and the work at Evolution Health is directionally correct. Much of what has been created there is very inspiring and creative. The issue is scale. We believe in order for this service to progress to the next level, it'd be best served to join forces with similar organizations to expand and grow. So our goal is to find a solution that allows us to continue the innovation and expand those capabilities and we are confident that such a solution is possible. Randy Owen, our President of Ambulatory Services Group, is leading a process to vet those options.","Our strategic review did reinforce our bullish view on Physician Services and Ambulatory Surgery Services. The value proposition for the Ambulatory Surgery Services is well established and I'm not going to spend much time reinforcing that here today. The ASC space is consolidating rapidly and we expect that trend to continue, and the recent combination of SCA and Optum further reinforces the strategic value thesis of that service line. As I have said publicly many times, the Physician Services space is embryonic in many ways, and although it is consolidating rapidly, it is still at a very early stage in this process. As it matures, the premium will go to those market leaders with true operational excellence and a customer-driven culture.","Honing our operational skills and customer focus are strategic imperatives here at Envision and I'm going to highlight a few elements of what I think that means. For us, it's about focusing on our managed care strategy. As I mentioned already, we expect to significantly shift our relationships to an in-network relationship. This has been an area of payor, provider and consumer tension for many recent years and I think all parties prefer to have stability, visibility and predictability in that relationship. And we think the timing is right for a mutually acceptable alignment, and we believe this can be achieved in a budget neutral or positive way.","Linked to that is our efforts around revenue cycle. We think that it's important to \u2013 as we gear up for this managed care strategy, we think it offers simplification and more predictability makes it much more efficient. It requires automation and management focus and our goal is to lower those DSOs and enhance the free cash flow.","We're also very focused on our efforts to control premium labor. We've consolidated and aligned our locum tenant services and recruiting services to better service our physician operations centers. We've increased the management accountability and we also work diligently through Bob's \u2013 Robert Coward's \u2013 leadership on the physician engagement strategy. We think the key to solving the premium labor issue is making Envision Physician Services the home of choice for the physician and for our physician partners.","And ultimately, it comes down to our focus on clinical quality and customer alignment. We've already said a lot about the relationship selling. We're also very focused on innovation, on standardizing our dashboards and business intelligence, preparing for macro readiness, and beginning to shift the organization proactively towards a deeper value model.","So, I know we're running a little short on time. I want to leave some time for questions. But in summary, I'd like to say that the integration is on track, our growth outlook for 2017 is strong, and we have great optionality as we consider our pathway from here.","So, with that, operator, we'll end our comments and open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. First question just on the ASCs, and I know there's a ton of moving parts here tonight, but the ASC business seems like it's showing relatively muted growth here, and I guess that's one of the bigger surprises to me. I understand the deconsolidations here and how that's a revenue headwind, as well as the EBITDA. But is there sort of a same-store EBITDA growth for the ASC segment? And maybe, what are some of the headwinds that you're seeing that might not be relevant to some of the competitors that have had relatively or much higher outlooks?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think we saw \u2013 part of it is, I think, we saw some slowness in Florida, where we have a significant concentration. But generally, we saw it in GI and in the multis. I would point out that we did have strong historical comps compete with in the quarter as well. Generally, long-term, we feel like the outlook that we baked into the general profile for the space and into 2017, which I think had a 1% or 2% volume growth, is very reasonable. We don't think anything systemic is happening that would alter that view. I think you'd have to see some sort of recession or some other alternative, Josh. And really, other than that, I think it was just an anomaly of the quarter and is not representative of what we think the space will do long-term.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think there's also a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities in that space as well.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just a second question on the ramp, the EBITDA guidance, I think you said $280 million to $290 million in the first quarter. And as you think about how that ramps up \u2013 or $291 million \u2013 as that ramps up to get to the full year number, there's a relatively steep acceleration through the year. And what are some of the seasonal factors that we should be thinking about that make that more pronounced this year?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, it's because we now have combined the Physician Services space, which has the payroll taxes in the fourth quarter. So, that has caused \u2013 that's really \u2013 yes, first quarter. So that really causes the lower first quarter in relation to the rest of the year. So you'll see a very low first quarter because of the higher payroll taxes and then you'll begin to see a ramp, big ramp into the second quarter, a much higher growth rate into second quarter and then a normal growth in the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter as we increase acquisitions and also, as we achieve the synergies that we have planned to achieve for the year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And what's the payroll tax impact? Do you know that number, Claire?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","No, I don't have the dollar amount in front of me.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right (34:51).","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Josh, this is Randy. If you look at the EmCare part of the business, I don't know (34:58) anesthesia...","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Should be similar.","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","There's about a $40 million difference between payroll taxes paid in Q1 versus in Q4. So, it's a meaningful (35:09) number.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And I think, from the legacy Physician Services at AMSURG, it was a $15 million to $17 million number. So, it's a big number.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to your commentary about the contracting and pursing an in-network strategy. I guess you said that you thought that this could be something that would be neutral. When you say that, do you mean neutral from a contracting perspective with the managed care companies? Or do you mean neutral back to Envision, after taking into account things like subsidies and staffing levels and things like that?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. My comments are focused on the impact to Envision. We think it can be a \u2013 it won't be dilutive to make the change. We've been very pleased with the receptivity to have the conversation with the payors. I think there was a little bit of convergence of different macro issues coming together, which makes it just the right time to have that conversation for all parties involved.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So I mean, I guess it makes sense that managed care would be excited about it, but the hospital partners are also engaged and willing to chip in to make it all work out?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think so. Yes.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is there any, I guess \u2013 is there a dynamic where you'll expect it to be seamless? Or do you think that initially, there could be a drag from that and over time, it gets (36:49)?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","(36:50) the goal is to make it seamless. That's really the beauty of where we've moved to as an organization. You don't have a conversation about a single contract or a single center. You talk to the payors about how it affects both of us. You're able to spread it out more evenly to make it a much more of a win-win conversation.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a last question, you talked about a lower growth rate on the same-store basis for 2017 than what you were originally anticipating. Is there any reason to believe that that's a growth rate that's the new normal after 2017? Or do you expect it to go back to what you guys (37:37) long-term?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's a fair question, Kevin. When we built the growth rate into the proxy model, we muted them below the 2015 and 2016 rates pre-ACA and they were fairly close to the old normal, if you will, but maybe slightly higher. So I think even with the downward dialing that we baked into this revision, we're sort of (38:11) in that middle range between the old, old normal and pre-ACA if that makes any sense.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Maybe just for Claire or Bob. I don't think I fully understood the revenue cycle comment, the impact on the quarter, what you're doing with the Physician Services business. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on that?","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. I think what Claire was trying to explain is we completed in 2015 over $800 million of transactions and then continued a fairly active pace in 2016. And so it's our strategic intent that we eventually and gradually migrate those practices onto our standard platform so that we have the best performance metrics and management metrics around our reimbursement that we can.","So there are a lot of variant test initiatives to take some of those larger practices onto our platforms over the last three months to four months of the year, and so you're seeing sort of a double dip on cost as we ramp up to prepare the assumption of those billing functions within the company while simultaneously continuing to pay what are quite commonly third-party outsourced vendors for that service.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I guess I'm sort of curious what was different versus your initial expectations for that conversion.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. I think the difference is that we have chosen to do a very cautious parallel testing in the integration of those practices, so that we don't have any disruption in the revenue cycle overall on the Charge Capture. So, our investment up front and ramping up for that is greater than what we had originally anticipated. So, we're budgeting and planning for a quicker cutoff and a quicker ramp-up of resources to cut over to our internal RCM function of what actually transpired.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. That makes sense.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Whit, I think strategically we view reducing the variation in our revenue cycle functions as having a long-term benefit that's worthy of this accelerated investment and accelerated pacing, particularly as we migrate in tandem with an in-network strategy. The better we are at capturing that data, tracking the actual to expected, doing those types of things, we think we're lowering the DSOs. I think that's all worth the investment.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I think I understand. And my next question is just on the comment that you made on your prepared remarks with the new contract sales, and it sounds like you've seen the sell rate increase to 91%. I'm just curious if that's a large enough sample size to draw a conclusion that we're making significant progress on that initiative? Just any color would be helpful.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","You know, Whit, I couldn't argue that (41:29) to be statistically valid. But I would say that anecdotally it's very clear in talking to the health systems that they \u2013 and this is part of what we've allowed time for when we built the model and thinking about the sales ramp, and educating them that shifting to fewer vendors has reduced the administrative costs, better output, less variation, and they get it. That's not a hard conversation, and we see that in the C-Suite conversations that we are having today. I am completely convinced and confident that our thesis is correct.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Claire, just going back to the guidance, as we think about \u2013 thank you for giving color on the adjustment down. But as we think about the visibility that you have into the moving parts, whether it's pricing volume, new contract wins, how should we think about your confidence there based on what you can see right now? And also, there's obviously a slight margin compression that's happening there versus the proxy, so is that just the flow-through impact of lower volumes? Or is there anything else to call out?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I don't think on the margin, I don't think there's anything there but lower volumes. And then the first part of your question is, and I think what you're asking is, what do we see in the first part of 2017 as far as volumes and revenue in relation to the guidance that we've given. Is that what your question is, Brian?","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Yes. That and also like your pricing visibility into the full year because obviously, that's a big driver of same-store.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think that we see \u2013 we've been comfortable with the volumes that we've seen for January through mid-February that we're in line with what we had forecasted for the year. So (43:43) on the volume side.","On the pricing side, at legacy AMSURG Physician Services, most of their contracts are in place with escalators. So, that's pretty laid out as to where we're going, and I can only look on the legacy Envision side just based on the history of what they've been able to achieve from a pricing standpoint. There doesn't seem to be a lot of movement in that. We did a very bottoms-up budget for both companies, and so we feel comfortable with what we've got in the guidance (44:21).","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then, Chris, just on the staffing side, are you seeing anything, now that the deal's closed, any pickup in turnover? I know you mentioned use of locums earlier. Then also, anything you're seeing in terms of labor cost inflation that you'd want to call out?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Let me have Bob weigh in on that.","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Certainly, I don't think there's been anything different subsequent to the merger as it relates to the overall market for labor. We all know that the EBHM specialty (44:51) is certainly challenged based on the supply\/demand imbalance, but nothing that's changed over the last three months to four months to change our outlook.","Clearly, we would hope and expect that if there are some muted volumes, you'd see that actually positively impact the supply\/demand imbalance for some of our providers, but as Chris said, the first thing we did out the gate is to realign some of the procurement and processes around how we access our per diem premium labor to try to mitigate its impact on the business. So those initiatives are quite active.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Last question from me. Claire, $900 million of M&A spend, do you think you could give us some guidance on how we should view the timing of those deals? And also, just looking at that number, it's a big number, obviously. How many big opportunities are out there? Will this be made up of a big number of smaller transactions?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","The pipeline is robust, and in the Physician Services, there are plenty of chunky opportunities. So as far as matching the pipeline to the opportunities is not \u2013 I don't think a high risk. As far as timing and the budget, I'll let Claire weigh in on that.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","It's spread fairly evenly throughout the year, probably less in the first quarter but then fairly evenly from the second to the fourth quarter.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll hear next from Tejas Ujjani with Goldman Sachs.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Just to follow up on that $900 million item. So is the bulk of that you mentioned going to be Physician Services? I mean I would think that there is still ASC opportunities. Can you kind of break it out between those two?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Sure. We have about a $100 million in the ASCs side of the business and I think about $75 million in the AMR side and the remaining would be in Physician Services.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's who we've allocated it.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's how we've allocated it in the budget.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","If you take the pipeline, we have nearly a 100 deals in the pipeline that we're currently vetting. You know the gross of that is too big to even mention on the line. Obviously not all those are viable, but there's more than enough in what we would call the first \u2013 close to closing phase to feel good about making the \u2013 meeting the expectation there.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just to follow up on the same contract Physician revenue guidance of the plus 3% to 4%. So just wondering if I understand that correctly. So is there no net new contracts growth being assumed here at all? I mean, I guess, I would have thought that if you'd gone through most of the rationalization process on the EmCare side that you're now at this kind of lower base and you should have some opportunity there?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well the way the math works, and that's the problem, and I think that's what I tried to address in my call, is that we will have negative net new contracts from a revenue standpoint because of that large group of contracts that were terminated in the third and fourth quarter of 2016. So it's not going to be a very meaningful statistic, because from an EBITDA standpoint we expect to have quite a bit of additional EBITDA from net new contracts. It's just that the revenue drag for the large number of contracts that were terminated really messes up the statistic.","So I think from a statistical standpoint you're going to see something like a negative 1% to 2% in net new. But we're expecting probably somewhere between $400 million and $500 million of new contract revenue in the year, it's just being offset by the drain from last year.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. And then last question just can you remind us what the revenue EBITDA was for Evolution just on the full year basis, at least for the portion that you would definitely retain, I guess the population health portion?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I don't know that \u2013 you want the separate \u2013 I don't have that. I don't have the separate number. We have not broken it out between the two.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Well just in a gross basis for all of Evolution, can you do that?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. Sure. For all of Evolution, total revenue for 2016 was $458 million and the EBITDA was a loss of about $7 million.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll hear from A. J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe first just to ask about the decision to look at exploring options with AMR. And you said in the prepared remarks that Rural Metro continues to be underperforming your expectations. Does that affect your thinking at all about doing something with AMR? Do you need to turn that aspect of it around before you do something or can you move ahead?","And then secondarily, how should we think about that from a big-picture standpoint? Do you have opportunities to redeploy the capital, either pay down debt, acquisitions, development that are robust enough to offset any short-term dilution that might come from getting rid of that? Or do you think you can do that on an accretive basis?","Randel G. Owen - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Hey. Thank you. This is Randy. Let me start at least with the first one, first part of your question here. So when you look at the Rural Metro, again as Chris said, it's been a challenging integration. I think you saw that throughout the year, as we reported earlier. The thing that's different here is that a big part of that challenge was inheriting an underperforming revenue management system and having to deal with that until we were able to integrate that into our core AMR system that's very stable as well as getting into some of those markets integrating them. So most of that work is now complete, so the integration of all the revenue cycle is now on the new stable system. The markets have been now integrated.","So we do see a very different story if you look at sort of the stability of that and what Rural brings to the story post kind of the integration versus what happened in 2016, which was challenging given some of the integration and the revenue cycle issues.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And, A. J., to your great question about where to redeploy in proceeds. And that's a key consideration for us as we think about and think through these remaining options. We do think that there are opportunities to deploy the capital but even if we don't, we think that there's power to reducing leverage and potentially expanding the valuation of the company. So you know, we're balancing all that out. We've even toyed around with the notion of buying back a certain amount of stock to offset the dilution, if that were necessary. But the board is considering all those options with an eye towards, what's the best result for creating shareholder value.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","And another question was, I think \u2013 I know you guys have reiterated your confidence in hitting the synergy target. If I remember right, and I might have this wrong, you had said that you didn't factor in the concept of taking Envision contracts and putting them upside AMSURG contracts, particularly in the Physician Services, and seeing what you could do in normalizing rates and that that had been a big source of synergies when AMSURG had purchased Sheridan. Is there any update on the thinking there? Have you had a chance to look at that at this point, and how has that impacted \u2013 is it in your guidance? Or is that still to be seen?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think it's baked in to what we're speaking about on the managed care strategy in total, and our goal is to re-engineer the relationships with the payers in what is, worse case, neutral to us, and we think that that's very possible.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe just one last one to slip in. I don't think you've commented yet about what you saw in the anesthesia business in the quarter. You said some pockets of regional solidness, and also I guess on the ER side, the visit trend was a little slower than it's been, that \u2013 some of the other companies have reported that, the hospital companies and so forth. But anything beyond ebb and flow that you're seeing there? Is this some dynamic that's changing as we go forward, you think? Or is it just that you get periods where the comparisons are tougher?","Robert J. Coward - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. So this is Bob. I think the fourth quarter was exceptionally difficult for us to get our finger on the pulse of surgical volumes, in part because of the impact of the hurricane that did go up the eastern part of Florida and the company's surgical concentration in the Florida market, trying to parse out what was happening in the subsequent month, in the sense of some of that volume that may have rebounded. But I do think in general, the volumes over the last, call it three to four months, have been somewhat lower than what we had seen in previous quarters.","I think there's a lot of anecdotal reasons that we're looking at, just in the same way that a lot of health care providers are looking at. In part, some of it could be how some of the exchange providers are starting to get more focused on their own networks, and so that could be impacting our volumes, depending on which hospitals they are contracting with. That could be one contributor, but also just trying to continue to look at the macroeconomic factors that might be impacting that volume.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, A. J.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Sorry for the airport background noise. I just had kind of a simple question. It looks to me like this deal, for now in 2017, it's pretty dilutive to your EPS. Am I reading that right? Or would AMSURG Sheridan standalone numbers have a down year-over-year earnings number?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","I think you are reading that right from a EPS standpoint, certainly not from an EBITDA standpoint, you're seeing substantial growth. But from an EPS, and really has to do with the fact \u2013 it's really three factors that are impacting the EPS.","We've got this resetting of the base because of the fourth quarter results, and bringing down slightly our same contract growth for the year, but what's different from the EBITDA growth is this depreciation and interest expense that was larger than what we had originally forecasted.","Capital structure affected the interest expense and the depreciation, some of that is related \u2013 about half of that depreciation expense that we did (56:24) know about was related to purchase accounting adjustments, where we revalued assets and increased the value based in the opening balance sheet, and the other, again, was related to some IT infrastructure build at both companies that was not contemplated.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Just to make sure we're clear, what is your forecast now for D&A and interest for 2017?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Depreciation \u2013 I'm going to leave the amortization off, because we add that back. Depreciation is about 1.9% to 2% of revenue. And then, assuming an interest expense of 5.3% to 5.5% on our total debt of about $5.9 billion.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So in total, how much was that (57:26) D&A and interest?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","So well, the $0.17 equates to about \u2013 let's see....","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I see it. I didn't notice the $0.17. That's fine. I got you.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","$0.17 on the depreciation and $0.12 on the interest.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I got you. I guess my two other kind of related questions would be, so this $900 million you're going to deploy, what sort of multiple should we forecast for that spend?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","In our modeling, we're using eight times.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And when you think about the strategic alternatives, at this point, do you have enough information to say we can exit these businesses at least at the price we paid? Or is there going to be some further dilution if you have to exit businesses you don't want to keep?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well, I think that's \u2013 when we say we had a lot of optionality, we have control over that, John.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sure.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","And we're not going to do it for the sake of doing it, and we're going to look at that carefully.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I know you did a lot of comparison to the proxy. I guess I just wanted to take a step back. If you look at EBITDA pro forma 2016, that number is $123.5 million (58:59). Is that \u2013 just want to make sure that's right.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's correct.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then assuming the $35 million of synergy over the top of that would be about $127.0 million (59:10) of EBITDA and then, from the midpoint of guide, that would imply something around 9.5% growth.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. And the $35 million from synergies and I want to be clear about that because that's really run rate synergies. We won't achieve all of that in 2017 but by the end of 2017 we'll be on that run rate. It will \u2013 in our plan we're expecting to achieve about $20 million of that because just of the timing of when those change. So you might want to adjust for that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. $20 million for the year, fair enough. Okay. And then I think you talked about volume thus far through I guess middle of the quarter, so in line with budgets. I was hoping to clarify that play the nuance here. Just in line with budget of assumption of higher volume and there's been a lot of discussion around flu or is that just volume trends in line with your sort of annual run rate?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","It's in line with our annual run rate guidance.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just last one for me. Can you give us cash flow expectations for 2017? And then just higher DSOs in the quarter and higher bad debt. Just want to circle back that that's not related to some of the out of network that you had talked losing that's driving some of that higher DSO.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Okay. I didn't hear your first question about cash flow. What was the question?","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just the expectation for 2017.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Oh, 2017. I think that we'll probably be in the operating cash flow before maintenance CapEx will probably be in the $650 million to $700 million range. We're still working through some of those numbers now but I think that's probably a good estimate.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of the DSO and the bad debt and just kind of reconciling against some of your commentary around the out of network, is that interrelated or no?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","No, the bad debt's not interrelated. I think \u2013 and the DSOs are up a little bit, as I said in my remarks, primarily at the Sheridan Physician Services. And I think they'll stay up through the first quarter and then we should begin to see that coming down to more normal levels.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. I think just about every question I could ask has been asked, but I do have one left here. You mentioned the impact of ACA at some point. I was just curious, any updated thoughts on what that \u2013 what the benefit has? Has that changed any from some of your initial thoughts around the time you were doing the financing? That's it. Thank you.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Are you talking about the consolidation of that joint venture? Is that what you're asking?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Did you say ACA? Or HCA, Frank? I'm not sure.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Yes. So, Frank, we want to be sure we understood your question. I thought you were asking about the HCA JV, but I'm not sure what the question was. I think we lost Frank.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","We'll follow up.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I'm here.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Okay.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'm sorry, not \u2013 the Affordable Care Act that you had commented...","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","(62:48).","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Okay.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Frank, we really haven't baked any modeling changes that are driven by ACA reform into 2017. We believe that anything that may impact us there is more likely to fall in 2018 or after.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But maybe if you'd remind us what the benefit has been? Thanks.","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Let's see, what has been the benefit of the ACA? Well it's increased throughout 2016. I'll tell you, we kind of went through this analysis and we thought it might be repealed. We went through a repeal and no replace analysis and it was about $80 million of EBITDA for the combined companies was what the benefit has been to us.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's fine. I just wanted to make sure that hadn't changed. Thank you.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to understand from your forecasting perspective, Chris, I think you characterized the fourth quarter as a little bit of an anomaly. So I guess I'm just a little bit surprised to see the guidance for 2017 come down as much as it did from the proxy. Can you maybe talk through that a little bit?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Well I think it was such a significant variance in Q4, if you extrapolate that forward, the good news is it's really only 50 basis points off of the same store assumption into 2017. But we're just dealing with the law of big numbers here, so that really I think more than anything has driven the optics of the variance.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So I mean is there \u2013 do you feel like there's any degree of conservatism that you've factored in by doing it that way, or?","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","That's a great question. The answer is that this is consistent with I think how AMSURG has always looked at things. We pay careful attention to historical trends and don't try to overreach, try to be realistic, and that's what we did here.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. So in thinking about your re-based earnings, I mean let's assume the volumes don't change and they stay at this level. How should we think about EPS growth, EBITDA growth in the out years that's off this re-base? And let's \u2013 don't worry about divestitures at this point, but can you get back to something like 10% to 15% EPS growth? Or are we kind of stuck at a lower plateau for now?","Claire M. Gulmi - Envision Healthcare Corp.","No, I think this is just kind of a reset. I think that we would see once we get past this year as you look at it, that the EPS and EBITDA growth would be very similar in that 13% to 15% range.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Holden, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Christopher A. Holden - Envision Healthcare Corp.","All right.

We direct you to the reconciliations included in our press release which is also available on our website unless otherwise noted all comparisons referred to the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. I will now turn the call over to our CEO Bill Sanger.","Bill Sanger","","Thank you Craig and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was the first reporting quarter for Envision Healthcare since we reentered the public market. I\u2019m pleased to report that the company produced outstanding results. Revenue increased 16.5% and adjusted EBITDA improved by 17.6% when compared to the same quarter last year.","Our growth was highlighted by EmCare which had a 24.5% increase in revenue driven by 16.4% organic growth of which 13.1% was from net new contracts. This record revenue growth resulted in 19.3% increase in adjusted EBITDA. On a year-to-date basis net organic contract within EmCare are projected to drive approximately $260 million in new annualized revenues. This includes a record number of new contract starts in the third quarter a majority of which were integrated to services.","Approximately 35% of contracts started since Q3 of last year were for additional services at existing facility relationships. As important our contract retention rate in the quarter was 98%. We believe these outstanding results at EmCare are driven by our unique value proposition in our integrated multiple service offerings. We also believe our integrated service strategy combined with our shared customer governance model has resulted in industry leading metric improvements, cost controls and improved patient outcomes.","Notwithstanding all of our growth in our integrated service offerings, as of the end of the third quarter only 20% of our facility relationships had multiple service lines. This provides us with unique pipeline and sufficient [ph] cross selling opportunities for the future.","At AMR we\u2019ve seen an improvement in 911 contract win rates in the same store revenue increases resulting in net revenue growth of 4.8%. We\u2019re seeing the benefits of our emphasis on clinical excellence under the leadership of our AMR, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ed Racht. We have established best of free field practices which have resulted in industry leading 911 patient survival rates.","We believe that the combination of our clinical excellence and our financial stability is the basis for our recent 911 contract wins. These include Shelby County, Tennessee, DeKalb County, Georgia and Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with the combined annualized revenue impact of approximately $75 million. On the expense side quarter-over-quarter we have seen a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins at AMR. This is the result of our platform for sustainable growth for PSG initiative and we started early last year which has improved our deployment and staffing utilization.","We expect additional margin improvements over the next few years as we fully implement these initiatives. These improvements coupled with our revenue growth drove a 14% increase of EBITDA over the same quarter last year. As mentioned during the recent IPO roadshow our new service evolution health further extends our continuous care strategy. Some of you may recall that we began this service as an expansion of the EmCare Hospitalist program to meet the needs of the post-acute care patients. This service is aimed at caring for high acuity patients prior to and post discharge from acute care facilities. Over the last several months Evolution Health has gained significant traction with health plans and hospital systems.","We\u2019re currently managing approximately 10,000 patients in three states and have effectively reduced the cost of care for these patients while demonstrating improved outcomes and also improved patient experience. We expect to significantly expand our geographic presence and patient population over the next year. Finally I like to provide an update on our improved balance sheet and our view of healthcare reform. As a result of our recent (indiscernible) we have paid off approximately $500 million of debt and raised additional cash. With our net leverage at 3.8 times combined with our liquidity of almost $900 million, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on our robust acquisition pipeline as well as other options to further grow the business and improve shareholder value.","Moving into Accountable Care Act, while we believe the initial roll out continuous to have challenges, we do anticipate that we will be a beneficiary from the reform. While it's too early to know that timing and the full benefits should be realized we do anticipate additional volumes primarily at EmCare as those with new coverage are expected to increase emergency utilization due to the shortage of primary care physicians.","We also anticipate an increase in reimbursement for encounter of both EmCare and AMR for the uninsured patients they may now secure Medicaid or usage based insurance coverage. I would like to now turn the call over to Randy, our CFO. Randy?","Randy Owen","","Thank you Bill. As highlighted in our earnings release that we just posted, our net revenue for the third quarter was 955.9 million, a 16.5% increase driven by 24.5% revenue growth at EmCare and 4.8% revenue growth at AMR. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 121.7 million an increase of 17.6% compared to Q3, 2012. We reported a net loss for the quarter of 7.7 million compared to net income of 15.2 million in 2012 which was attributable primarily to the impact of one time IPO related cost. These cost included a $20 million termination payment of the consulting agreement with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and 29.5 million in cost related to the redemption of our Senior PIK Toggle Notes.","Redemption cost included 12.4 million of a cash premium to call the bonds and 17.1 million in non-cash expense to write-off unamortized loan fees. GAAP diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.05 which included the impact of IPO related cost. Excluding the after tax impact of the two items mentioned above our adjusted EPS was $0.13. Beginning in Q4, 2013 in addition to GAAP EPS we will also report EPS adjusted for tax effective amortization expense and other non-recurring items.","In Q3, 2013 our EPS adjusted for tax affected IPO related cost and amortization expense was $0.20 a share. EmCare net revenue was 605.1 million in the quarter, an increase of a 119.2 million or 24.5%. Acquisition revenue growth was 8.1% primarily related to the expansion of our post-acute services. Organic revenue increased 80 million or 16.4% over the prior year, 64 million or 13.1% of the increase came from net new contracts started since October 1 of last year.","This is an increase from the 10.5% net new contract growth we had in the first six months of 2013 due to an acceleration of new contract starts in the quarter. Revenue increased 3.8% at same store contracts from an increase in new revenue for weighted patient encounter of 1.9% and from an increase in weighted patient encounters of 1.9% including a 1.3% volume growth in our same store emergency department contracts. We have recorded a year-to-date net adjusted EBITDA benefit for Medicaid Parity of approximately 8 million including 3 minimum in Q3 at EmCare. We anticipate full year net adjusted EBITDA impact of Parity in 2013 to approximately 10 million to 12 million after netting it up physician compensation and other related offsets.","We started collecting Parity payments from 19 states to-date; however we have not collected from some of our larger states including Texas and California that have announced that payments including retroactive payments for \u201913 will begin next year. We\u2019re still scoring the full impact of Medicaid Parity for 2014 and anticipate an increased benefit next year due to our continued growth and the full year impact of states that did not make retroactive payments in \u201913.","We will provide further information on the expected net EBITDA benefit in \u201914 when we release our 2014 guidance. EmCare adjusted EBITDA increased 19.3% to 82 million with an EBITDA margin of 13.6% versus 14.1% last year. The slight decline in margin was primarily due to additional startup compensation cost driven by the number of recent contract starts and recruiting challenges that at a small number of selected contracts. Startup cost typically include physician contract buyout provisions, sign-on bonuses and temporary staffing cost.","Insurance expense included the decrease of 0.1 million for favorable prior year development this quarter compared to a decrease of 1 million in Q3, 2012.","AMR net revenue was 350.8 million an increase of 4.8%. Revenue from existing market increased 9 million or 2.8%. In existing markets our weighted volume decreased by 0.8% primarily due to the softness in the IFT markets. Revenue per transport increased 3.6% in existing markets due to rate increases and a higher 911 transport mix.","Revenue per transport from net new contracts increased by 2.3% primarily from the impact of a recent managed transportation acquisition offset by decreases in FEMA deployment revenue for Hurricane Isaac of approximately 6 million in Q3, 2012.","As a reminder Q4, of 2012 included approximately 37 million of net revenue and associated EBITDA for our Hurricane Sandy FEMA deployment. So our Q4, 2013 compared to our Q4, 2012 AMR net revenue and EBITDA will be affected by that deployment. AMR adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 39.6 million compared to 34.7 last year for an increase of 14.2%.","EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points to 11.3% in the quarter and is due primarily to a reduction in expenses as a percent of net revenue related to the impact of PSG initiative that Bill noted. Insurance expense includes an increase of 1.7 million for unfavorable prior year development compared to an increase of 0.1 million in Q3, 2012.","Cash flow provided by operating activities was 51.7 million in the quarter excluding the onetime IPO related operating cash outflow of 20 million compared to a 106.1 million last year. Change is primarily due to an increase in net income excluding IPO related cost offset by an income tax refund of 43 million received in third quarter last year and an increase in accounts receivable during 2013.","Accounts receivable increased 71.5 million in the quarter compared to an increase of 25.5 million in the prior year. While AMR\u2019s DSO remained unchanged in the quarter and has decreased this year, EmCare\u2019s DSO as we noted in the press release increased six days primarily as a result of two factors. First as we discussed in our IPO roadshow provider enrollments were previously delayed by CMS due to a requested change in our enrollment process. While our process have been, improvements years ago, CMS requested a modification to this process. In June both we and CMS agreed to the process changes and we completed virtually all of their requested modifications to the enrollments that had been on-hold and by late September CMS released a significant portion of those enrollments with an expected cash impact of approximately $25 million.","We expect collect a majority of these receivables in the fourth quarter and collected approximately 7 million in October. Second we have had a significant number of recontract starts. New contracts typically experienced an increase in accounts receivable and DSO for 6 to 9 months before we returned to a normalized collection path.","I would like to point out that while we expected a reduction in DSO in the fourth quarter of \u201913 and in 2014 we anticipate DSO to be higher than historical levels due to our working capital investment associated with a higher level of organic starts. Net investing in financing cash flows are highlighted in the press release. Adjusted free cash flow was 35.4 million in third quarter compared to 77.7 million last year. The difference is attributable primarily to the aforementioned changes in accounts receivable at EmCare and an income tax refund receipt in third quarter of \u201912.","With the reduction in leverage and increased liquidity we anticipate using a substantial portion of our liquidity for our acquisitions. In addition we\u2019re evaluating capital structure options that may include additional debt reductions. Finally we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 457 million to 462 million of 2013, 2014 guidance will be given when we release our fourth quarter results. Bill?","Bill Sanger","Thank you Randy and operator we now would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes to us from Brian Zimmerman of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Zimmerman your line is open.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs","","Could you give us some comments on the types of opportunities you\u2019re seeing on the AMR segment with the major competitors seeing some struggles there? Have you seen a pickup in these opportunities?","Bill Sanger","As I mentioned Brian, by the way good afternoon we won several 911s, three of which previously were held by Rural\/Metro. We do know that San Diego which is a relatively large 911 is also going out to bid this year. I do believe there will be opportunities, I really cannot quantify them at this point in time as it relates to the challenges Rural\/Metro has. We do also believe that more cities will be evaluating alternatives as they continue to struggle with balance in their budgets and looking at alternatives to outsourcing from the, referred to as a third party to a private provider.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs","Okay and then it seemed like your same contract volumes actually got better sequentially, can you make some comments on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of emergency room department volumes?","Randy Owen","I think when we talked before and even on the road show with concerns about volumes in the first half of the year and we had a very slight negative in Q2. We always felt like there were some seasonal changes and impacts to that. So we had seen stability in volumes we believe obviously a number of our facilities are in the Southern part of the U.S. for which I think we have seen more stable volumes where I know for us and others there have been some pressure in volumes in the Northern part of the country.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs","Okay and then in your prepared remarks you mentioned that it's a bit tough to certainly [ph] the impact of healthcare reform but with all this coming out of the news around enrollments and on the exchanges, have any of your views changed towards what you\u2019re expecting to see from a benefit standpoint going forward?","Bill Sanger ","No we continue to quantify those Brian. You know clearly our challenges in terms of the roll outs of the exchanges, I do believe that you know whether it's a society or the government, we will work those issues through and that we will see the benefits in the near future but somewhat delay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray. Mr. Ellich your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","","First of all could you may be talk about your capital deployment? Randy gave some comments about you know may be looking at additional debt pay downs I guess. How aggressive do you think you guys could be in 2014 and then what are you looking at and seeing on the M&A front?","Bill Sanger","Yeah had couple of things so one look, obviously we\u2019re evaluating a few options you know we know in the near term we can pull back up to 35% of our bonds so that\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019re evaluating here. We can also obviously pay down term debt if we choose, it may also be opportunities to look at repricing some of our debt given a much better you know improved capital structure and leverage profile. So I expect some combination here when you look at cash not only the liquidity we could have now but obviously the free cash flow that we expect continue to generate. So again as I said I think the majority of our cash will be used for growth opportunities, there is a very strong pipeline you know of opportunities but I do expect us to kind of conclude on other sort of debt options here in the next few months before we get into next year.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","And then going back to your Parity comments Randy also, I think you said 10 million to 12 million is what you expect for the year. Was that in kind of in-line with what you were expecting when Parity was first laid out and I guess what percentage went to the physicians?","Randy Owen","Well there is not, I don\u2019t have an overall percentage Kevin. Obviously they go through whatever plans you know plans we have. Traditionally those have been anywhere from sort of 20% to 30% depending on the contract and where it is and the volumes et cetera, the Medicaid mix of those contracts for example. So it's a smaller percentage. It is a little better than we thought so when you look at that 10 million to 12 million I think we thought you know that\u2019s after you take out some of those cost. So I think initially we were thinking 8 to 10 was sort of the number we had initially sort of calculated so we\u2019re seeing some improvement and actually we probably expect more improvement in \u201914 as we again we have had a lot of growth recently and as we identify which of those physicians in that growth is eligible for that Parity and growth in the business and again as I mentioned not having the retro-payments. We expect a bigger increase which we will discuss next quarter.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","And then just one last one for Bill. Looking at your overall contracting environment, you\u2019ve had some nice net new wins and gave some good detail in your prepared remarks. Just wondering you know are lot of these opportunities really being driven by the crowd [ph] selling and I guess how was that trended over time and what should we think about or how should we expect that to unfold in 2014?","Bill Sanger","If you look at approximately 20% of our facilities today have multiple service lines and I think the sort of value proposition is that the integrated model really follows patient not just episodically but throughout the care in the hospital setting. Under the leadership of Todd Zimmerman, President of EmCare. We have really refine that strategy, we believe that as we go forward those opportunities is going to continue not only in the facilities that have limited multiple services line but as we sell we\u2019re finding more and more we\u2019re not selling single contracts, we\u2019re selling multiple contracts. I do think there has been a sea change in the industry as it relates you know the selling contracts.","Operator","Our next question comes for us from A.J. Rice of UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS","","Maybe just first of all ask for a little more color on the Evolution Health and maybe even the nature of an update on the nature of discussions you\u2019re having with the insurers and the providers about working with you and I know also there were some discussion about acquisition opportunities maybe down the road, any update in things you\u2019re looking at there?","Operator","One moment please while we resolve some technical difficulties.","A.J. Rice - UBS","I was just asking, I don\u2019t know if you heard the question about Evolution Health and just if there is any update maybe a little more drill down on the discussions you\u2019re having with payers and providers about using this service, where is that sort of taking you as well as any discussion about related acquisitions? I know there is some hope in overtime you might see some transactions that enhance capability there.","Bill Sanger","I will start off with to remind everyone in Evolution Health our client, our customers, our health plans and hospital and hospital systems. For hospitals and hospital systems our emphasis on shifting and managing the readmission process. As an example we have been able to reduce generally speaking we\u2019ve been able to reduce readmission rates for an average Medicare readmission rate is about 27% in this country, ours are down between 7% and 9%. As it relates to health plans our activity is really with some of the larger health plans and really managing the highest acuity patients that comprises the majority of the spend.","If you look at the types of patients we manage you know at this point in time they are generally multi-core morbidity patients have spent anywhere between a 150,000 - 200,000 of healthcare resources over the last year. Our numbers are less than half of that as we manage those patients. We will be seeing more development as we get more active with signing contracts in different areas of the country. We\u2019re care for patients in three states today. We\u2019re in active discussions with the major health plans as well as in chain discussions with major health systems to manage their readmission process. So I\u2019m very bullish about the growth opportunities for Evolution Health and I think you will hear a combination of not only new (indiscernible) startups but also some acquisitions in the future.","A.J. Rice - UBS","And maybe I throw in one more question just I know you\u2019ve the joint venture with HCA and there was some discussion that overtime that might broaden out. Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s progressing at this point?","Bill Sanger","Well our joint venture with HCA is really a shared governance model that I have referred to in my prepared remarks. I believe that the venture is achieving it's objectives and that is to improve overall patient care at lower cost. I would think that if you would ask questions of our partners at HCA as it relates to our relationship I think they would also reflect to the fact that we have achieved those objectives.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay but in terms of the facility served at this point, is there any update on how?","Bill Sanger","We continue to roll out throughout the system and I don\u2019t have an exact number for you now but it certainly has increased overtime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","I was going to say hopefully there is no emergency at the hotel but based on your business I don\u2019t know if that would be the worst thing. So quick question on the Evolution you just talked on A.J\u2019s question. Do you guys have a revenue when you need that contribution from Evolution in the quarter?","Bill Sanger","Well we do Josh, we haven't disclosed that, that\u2019s part of the EmCare segment and I think it's fairly similar to what we have probably talked on the IPO where the revenue is still little over $100 million obviously the bigger opportunity there as Bill mentioned discussions that we\u2019re having where we expect to see growth in that from both you know health plans and health systems.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","Okay so maybe breaking it out in the future when it's matured.","Bill Sanger","Yeah at some point we would expect it.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","Okay. The guidance the 457 to 462 for adjusted EBITDA, how much of that is EmCare? Are you guys sort of given segment like guidance as well or are we just going to stick with sort of a combined number?","Bill Sanger","No we\u2019re sticking with combined number at this point, that\u2019s what we have done before and that\u2019s what we anticipate doing going forward.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","And then just last question on reform, obviously we\u2019re seeing a little bit of delay in some of the exchanges I think it's probably more timing than anything else. But are you guys working with any of your hospital partners, I\u2019m thinking more on the EmCare side but even on AMR around outreach programs or you know identification and specific individuals and things like that. Do you have any specific actions that you guys are taking and maybe if you can talk about the timing of those actions?","Bill Sanger","With both hospitals and communities we\u2019re early stage of discussions, many of our hospitals have been working with our physicians and our staff and AEDs. If you will to gear up to assist the patients as they enter into the emergency room if they are eligible assist them in the paperwork [ph] and help them get into what may be available to them. We\u2019re at very early stages, very early stages. I mean we have begun discussions in the last several weeks with communities about outreaching out in the community relative to identifying who might be eligible and what systems are available utilizing our AMR workforce to assist those folks and securing some type of coverage. So the answer to that is yes but in a very limited fashion but I see it accelerating substantially overtime.","Randy Owen","Josh we have always worked especially the hospital have worked very closely with the hospital even in the past, if there was an uninsured working with them to see if they met any Medicaid qualifications or whatever else. So I would expect that to continue and be pretty seamless.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","","Just a few little questions here, looks like your self-pay volumes kind of as a percentage have sort of picked up a little bit and sequentially there looks like they expect the Medicare, was there anything behind that move or was it just normal seasonality of variation?","Bill Sanger","Andrew it's more seasonality. There weren\u2019t any sort of specific markets or specific areas where we saw a sudden, big change.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Otherwise they are fairly, necessarily stable on the quarter?","Bill Sanger","Yes exactly.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","","Okay and then just moving over to the AMR side, it looks like a revenue per weighted transport went up pretty strong, I think it was close to 6% here. Anything worth breaking out behind of numbers and is that kind of a sustainable run-rate going forward? I think I had it coming in a little bit below at the corner, that I expected to.","Bill Sanger","Yeah couple of things Andrew on that, if you look at that close to 6% number, look about half of that number as I mentioned is related to sort of an increase in our from an acquisition or managed transportation business that business as we have said before and for those not familiar we don\u2019t do transports on that, we\u2019re a broker and we provide services. So all the revenues that comes in from that and a few other businesses are really sort of non-transport related and really impact the rate. So if you look at it from a real rate standpoint the way we look at it is on our same market basis where we had about a 3.6% increase in the rate for our ambulance transports and that really was driven by normal sort of inflationary increases, rate increases as well as a stronger 911 mix with obviously a higher reimbursement for 911 transports.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","","And just last question, I was just thinking about the volume trends maybe up close both segment nationally there. Where there any trends worth highlighting of strengthens or weaknesses across the country or a region [ph]? Thanks.","Bill Sanger","Not really. I think similar to what you know maybe some hospitals and others are reporting I think you know volumes in some of the northern, North-East for us or maybe little softer. We continue to be you know positive stable volumes for majority of our business and whether it's Florida, Texas and the southern part of the U.S. So we didn\u2019t really see anything that we consider really unusual and is more seasonal as we sort of anticipate. AMR we see some softness in the IFT, the non-emergency market as we mentioned but the 911 volumes continue to be positive and continue to be stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joanna Kornacka - America Merrill Lynch","","It's Joanna Kornacka filling in for Kevin today. Thank you for taking the questions here just on the few last here, on the new contract wins there are number of upbringing pressures [ph] there. Can you give us a little more color in terms of the types of contracts you know by business line that you\u2019re getting there?","Bill Sanger","The maturity of our new contracts are the combined ED, hospitalist program. We are seeing a greater interest in our combined anesthesia hospitalist integrated program as well but the majority of this last quarter were ED and Hospitalist.","Joanna Kornacka - America Merrill Lynch","And similar question but in terms of the acquisition commentary that it seems like there are couple of things in the pipeline and you\u2019re going to be focusing your capital from there, probably so any color in terms of which areas will be the focus areas there in terms of acquisitions? Are you focusing mostly on growing the Evolution health business or I guess anesthesia versus ED, so any color you can give there?","Bill Sanger","I think we will see acquisitions in all aspects of the business. I think I would expect a majority of that activity to be both on sort of the EmCare and Evolution health segment of the business. I do think there are a number of really good ambulance transport opportunities and certain markets that are adjacent where you can get you know some synergy for that. So I do expect to see acquisitions in all parts of the business but probably if there is more focus or more likelihood of larger transactions will be more on the EmCare and Evolution health side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","","I wanted to just ask a few things, the first is just as it relates to you know how you\u2019re guiding implicitly for Q4, pretty nice step-up in EBITDA sequentially so I guess I just wanted to get you know some brief comments from you about how you think that take shape, is there just a little less startup expenses, and in Q4 is there anything that you want to call out relative to that? What\u2019s implied in the guidance?","Bill Sanger","The only thing I would say is look we expect to continue to see a solid number of new starts, so we know what we have sort of on-tap and what we believe what we will be starting in the quarter and so I think that will still be very positive. With that we will continue to be you know startup cost as we have seen and so I think we will still see a little higher level on that. I think margins will be especially if you look at the EmCare size, we will be fairly stable. So I don\u2019t expect any sort of major changes and sort of volume trends or anything like that and continue to expect to see some nice growth on the net new contract side.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","","And then just you know back to your comments Randy on AMR and we saw I guess a step up in the managed transport revenue. I think that\u2019s been tracking you know sort of in the 12% to 13% of AMR range. What was it in the quarter? And is that now a new level or do you think it will climb from even what we saw here in Q3?","Bill Sanger","It is still a fairly small part of the AMR size. I don\u2019t have the number exactly but that sounds pretty close from that standpoint. It is an area that I think we\u2019ve talked about for a long time that it's an area that we have an interest in as you continue to see some (indiscernible) in the non-emergency market and continue to see an ability to over the longer term utilize other transportation modes to transport patients and take care of patients. We\u2019re obviously trying to be proactive in that and so it continues to be an interesting us both on a state, Medicaid program for example and on the commercial side. So I do think overtime we expect to see that to increase as a percent of the AMR growth, we may not see it as much in the near term just because I think we\u2019ve additional 911 opportunities that we may see on the ambulance side.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","And did you enter a new state, can you just talk a little bit about what you acquired and what access you get from that deal?","Bill Sanger","Yeah I mean the acquisition that we did was in Florida so it was a new footprint for us which was nice and it was of interest to us. So we do have a fair amount of business in AMR in the Florida area. This was in the western part of Florida. So it was a nice sort of tuck in in a new platform to really expand some of those services in sort of the top eastern part of the country.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","And just last thing, you mentioned that presentation for EPS and new convention for Q4 and we\u2019re used to seeing that I guess just if you could help us think about the actual pretax amortization that you think applies here on a quarterly basis to just basing your run-rate.","Bill Sanger","Yeah let me see if I can pull it up here. Darren amortization if you look at I guess pretax if you look at that, we\u2019ve been running you know roughly about sort of 19 million or so a quarter on a pretax amortization perspective and I sort of expect that number to continue. So I would use that number to think about that from your modeling perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Daniels of William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","","I guess quick one for you Bill, given the strength you\u2019re seeing in net new contract wins, which I know is a record year-to-date. Can you talk a little bit about some of the investments that you\u2019re making or any changes you might be making on physician recruiting to you know sure you can staff such a strong level of new business?","Bill Sanger","Yeah as I mentioned Todd Zimmerman our President has made several changes at EmCare to really reflect the new growth rate that we expected to continue into the near future. We have made substantial investment both technology and people on the recruitment side and we believe that the combination of, we recruit more physicians not only on aggregate basis but also on a percentage basis that we ever have in the past. One of the biggest challenges we always have is when we have contract losses we lose our physicians as well. Having a 98% retention rate last quarter was really helpful, as you get to keep those physicians and not to worry about recruiting new physicians for ended [ph] contracts. I do believe that we will be challenged like everyone in the industry as I said in the past, the denominator of this equation is being able to recruit physicians and I think we do a very good job that we recruit over 1000 physicians last year and clinicians. I do believe our new technology combined with our new emphasis on recruitment will substantially meet our needs going into the future.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","And then maybe a follow-up to I think A.J\u2019s question just on your JV model with HCA, are you seeing more interest from other facilities maybe larger IDMs or national operators and the ability to kind of bundle together hospital that may need and may not need subsidies into a bigger package and type of JV relationship? Any color on what you might be seeing there.","Bill Sanger","You know clearly as I said earlier I just think there is a sea change in the industry and particularly in the systems approach to our top placed physician contracting and although HCA kind of set the stage, there are other systems for profits and not for profits that are absolutely heading at that direction.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay and then just one quick one for Randy in regards to the Medicaid Parity. I want to make sure I had this right. Are you recognizing that on a cash or an accrual basis? I know we've got different companies doing it differently based on the states paying or not paying at this point.","Randy Owen","Yeah Ryan it is in accrual basis. So while we have gotten cash from quite a few state, they are lagging and so we have I think from a cash standpoint we\u2019ve collected probably close to a $1 million so far. So we\u2019re comfortable, we have gone through all the process from an accrual standpoint you know it's appropriate and I think like others and as I\u2019ve heard with others we expect to see that cash start to accelerate and then even more so next year as other states really start some of that funding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Campbell of Avondale Partners.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","","I just had a couple of quick modeling ones. Randy, could you tell us about, you had some restructuring charges in the quarter, and I noticed you didn't exclude those from your adjusted EPS calculation. Maybe you could talk to us a little bit about what those charges are and why they are not excluded from the adjusted EPS?","Randy Owen","Look some of these we have had some of these restructuring charges in the past and you can see it from quarter-to-quarter in our historical financials. We\u2019ve had them from time to time especially over the last couple of years from AMR. We have you know made some changes in the business for example and closed some offices or some operations, exited some markets you know example. So while it is clearly I guess mutual from a base operating standpoint, it's not sort of a non-recurring event. It doesn't occur that often or that sizable, and it obviously has a pretty immaterial to EPS. So at this point we just focused on the things that we felt were sort of non-recurring related to the IPO sort of transaction.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","And should we think about those being roughly the same size going forward? Or was this quarter unusually high or low?","Randy Owen","No I think you will see whether it's this number or even lower. Again it sort of varies depending on that, I think we\u2019ve been through if you look at the last few years, more of our restructuring as we have changed, made changes on the AMR business especially. So I actually would expect to see that number to decline overtime but we may choose at some point to make another adjustment to the business that we think has a big benefit long term and could have that happen again.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","Okay. And then on the D&A and interest expense, those are both a little bit off from what I was thinking. So is the third quarter run rate for D&A a good number? And with the interest expense, should, same question, or should we expect interest expense maybe to be a little bit lower, depending on when you actually paid off the debt?","Randy Owen","Well I think if you look at, I would still expect sort of the D&A to be fairly close to that from a run-rate perspective. We may see a little tick up in D&A just as I mentioned we had some additional capital from some of the new 911s that we will begin to depreciate but it's not a material sort of difference in that sort of run-rate. I think from an interest standpoint we did pay PIK notes we paid off on August 30th. So you didn\u2019t have sort of the full quarter benefit of that given the timing of the IPO. So you do have probably around 34 million or so of cash interest expense that I would expect on a quarterly basis given the current structure we have today, okay? And then there is another call it 4 million or so that\u2019s for the non-cash amortization around the debt and the loan fees.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","And then for the new contracts for AMR, the three new ones you guys called out, remind me. Did those have any impact at all in third quarter? Or if not, when do they startup?","Randy Owen","Well minimal, Shelby and DeKalb County started in August so there wasn\u2019t a significant impact, those were smaller. The larger one which is sort of Tulsa, Oklahoma City which is about 50 million of the 75 started on November 1st.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","Okay and then last question. Bill, could you maybe go over some of the new contract numbers again? I think I missed some of them as you were writing a bunch. I want to make sure I have the numbers correct for EmCare.","Bill Sanger","So we did report numbers and we have reported revenue but not numbers. Year-to-date new contract wins contributed on annualized basis about 260 million of new revenue. We\u2019re going to stay away from reporting contracts and just report net revenue wins.","Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners","Okay. So that was $260 million of net new annualized revenue signed year to date, and the number was 35% of that was additional service lines? Is that correct?","Bill Sanger","Yes correct. You know sources of existing relationships.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","","Just a couple quick ones here on the EmCare side of the business. Could you comment a little bit about what you are seeing from an acuity standpoint, or acuity trends are? And then secondly, in your markets, are you seeing any increased competition from urgent care centers around the country? Thanks.","Bill Sanger","You know clearly we\u2019re seeing somewhat of an increase in the case mix index in terms of our ER as well as the hospitalist visit. Now obviously if the flu season comes back we will see that case mix index go down, obviously those are lower acuity individuals. As it relates to competition urgent care centers not so much urgent care centers as much as freestanding EDs particularly in Texas for instance Houston has I think ED freestanding EDs these are 24 hour emergency departments. I know there has been a lot of state action that the medical society hospital organizations are trying to stop the proliferation of the freestanding EDs. We do see some cannibalization in areas like Houston and southern parts of Texas but we haven't really experienced too much elsewhere in the country at this point in time.","Operator","I show no further questions in the queue at this time.","Bill Sanger","Okay thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to our Q4 call with you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining the Envision Healthcare Holdings third quarter earnings call. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
