At this time your telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions-and-answers with instructions given at that time. And, as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations, Keri Mattox. Please go ahead.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter and full year financial results. I'm Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen; and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call we also will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provide in today's press release as well as on our website. During this conference call we will also make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, EPS, operating margin and income taxes.","Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

You can find it at the investors page of our website, amerisourcebergen.com.","You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We do ask that you limit your question to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, as well as AmerisourceBergen's continued execution. Revenues were up 4% to $39 billion for the quarter and 4% to $153 billion for the full year. And our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.33 for the fourth quarter and $5.88 for the full year, an increase of 2% and 5% respectively compared to the previous fiscal year periods. We are proud of this execution and performance, especially against a backdrop of an ever involving healthcare landscape. Along those lines, I want to take a moment to again thank our amazing team of 20,000 associates for their dedication, execution and performance this year.","Specifically, I am so proud of the way our entire team worked very seamlessly, collaboratively and tirelessly through some of the worst hurricanes in recent history. I was just recently in Houston to meet with our associates there. I saw firsthand how our preparedness and rapid action in Houston, as well as in Florida, Puerto Rico and elsewhere, ensured that our associates and their families were safe, and that we were able to continue to operate to deliver products and services and to ensure access to critical, sometimes life-saving, treatments for patients.","Due to the preventative steps and comprehensive preparations of our operations team, I'm also happy to report that none of our AmerisourceBergen facilities sustained material damage. It is our associates who continue to go above and beyond every day for AmerisourceBergen for our customers, and importantly for the patients who need their medical treatments. Our associates help shape our culture, power our corporate transformation and are driving our growth, so, sincere thank you.","Before I continue my commentary this morning, I do want to take a few moments to discuss something that is critically important to AmerisourceBergen and that affects all of us. Opioid and the rising levels of their abuse. AmerisourceBergen understands and appreciates the enormity of this challenge, both for the healthcare industry and for the country more broadly. And we are mobilized to address it. We are working diligently at ABC collaboratively across our industry with other distributors in HDA and very closely with legislators, policymakers and regulatory agencies to monitor and stop suspicious orders and minimize and deter diversion.","In addition to reporting and stopping orders determine to be suspicious, we are also provide daily reports about the quantity, type and receiving pharmacies of every single order of controlled substances we distribute through regulatory and enforcement professionals.","Additionally, along with our partner Walgreen's we've expanded the safe medication disposal kiosks, take-back program and our Good Neighbor Pharmacy's safe drive disposal program in conjunction with the national DEA prescription drug takeback day.","AmerisourceBergen Foundation is also actively working to support a broader range of educational programs. AmerisourceBergen takes very seriously our role in the supply chain, and our responsibility to patients. Getting FDA approved drugs from pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them, to DEA registered pharmacies that dispense them, based on prescriptions written by licensed healthcare providers, we will continue to work diligently and collaboratively to address this challenge.","Now as we enter our fiscal year 2018 we believe that our consistent ability to execute and to achieve more, even in an evolving healthcare market, will continue to drive growth. We expect to increase our revenues, grow our operating income and improve our EPS. Tim will talk more about our fiscal year 2018 expectations and full financial guidance in a few minutes.","My comments today will be focused on our corporate transformation, how we are utilizing our scale and expertise to maximize our portfolio, and how AmerisourceBergen will drive value to fiscal year 2018 and beyond.","Let me start with a bit of context and background. First, and very importantly, we continue to believe that AmerisourceBergen has a solid differentiated platform, one that sets us apart from others in the industry. We have a fast growing base of strategic anchor customers. We offer the most innovative services and solutions. We are the undeniable leader in specialty product distribution and services, and we have a proven track record of successful financial stewardship.","AmerisourceBergen's strong platform supports growth for our customers and ultimately enhances patient access to quality healthcare. The AmerisourceBergen platform also enables us to execute in an ever changing healthcare environment. We all know there are challenges in healthcare today, but we also see significant opportunities. Healthcare is a critical, integral and growing part of the U.S. economy, and AmerisourceBergen has strategically focused its business on the U.S. pharmaceutical market.","IMS expects a greater than 5% annual growth rate over the next five years for the U.S. pharmaceutical market and AmerisourceBergen expects to outpace that growth due to our strong customer base and leadership in Specialties. An aging U.S. patient population continues to demand the support of pharmaceutical intervention which can ultimately help control overall healthcare costs. The path line of innovative new specialty drugs is robust and growing especially in oncology and a final opportunity to highlight. We believe that patient access to healthcare coverage will continue, especially with a healthy economy and higher employment numbers as a driving factor.","So how is AmerisourceBergen positioned to seize these opportunities? How will we drive value and growth in fiscal year 2018 and beyond? Most importantly, our corporate transformation is key. And we have made substantial progress on these efforts since we first unveiled them in June. In fact, many of the new leaders coming into key positions as we transform the business are coming from within AmerisourceBergen. It is a source of pride and very gratifying to me to see the realization of our succession planning efforts as strong internal candidates are successfully promoted to new management roles.","These new managers are being so well received internally and externally by associates, our customers and suppliers. To me this is a great validation that our talent development pipeline is proving very effective. The focus on developing our team and our transformation overall, shows that we are customer focused. We are evolving our business to provide both our upstream manufacturer customers and our downstream provider customers with a seamless integrated experience that makes it easier for them to not only do business with AmerisourceBergen, but to run their business day-to-day.","We are continuing to reshape our business units for maximize efficiency and a streamlined approach. We have organized into two primary segments, first, Pharmaceutical Distribution and Strategic Global Sourcing, and second, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health that are integrated, collaborative and optimized.","Just last month, we gathered more than 500 AmerisourceBergen associates in Dallas for our One Future Transformation meeting. And I can tell you, enthusiasm, support and energy was impressive. This group, as well as countless other working groups and associates across all of AmerisourceBergen, is dedicated to being part of the solution and actively participating in our corporate transformation. It's a hands on process, and importantly it's our corporate strategy that is driving the changes to our structure.","We are excited to keep moving our transformation forward and to provide you with ongoing updates. In short, we are one AmerisourceBergen, and we are positioned to strategically, dynamically and successfully address today's healthcare market forces, and work seamlessly with our customers to capitalize on its opportunities.","Now on to answer the second question I posed a few moments ago. How will we drive value and growth in fiscal year 2018 and beyond? First, we will leverage scale with our corporate transformation and evolved business model. AmerisourceBergen has a differentiated go-to-market strategy, one that is illustrated by our fast-growing customer base and strategic sourcing initiatives. We are proud of our focus on creating a seamless integrated experience that supports our customers and accelerates their growth as well as our own. And we are more integrated across our portfolio businesses than ever before. We're making huge strides in our integrated business development efforts, reaching best practices, best business practices in human and animal health and leveraging our full breadth of experience and expertise to establish AmerisourceBergen as the leader in new areas of innovation.","For example, we're really at the forefront of the commercialization and successful launch of groundbreaking cell and gene therapies, as we see this as a compelling future growth opportunity.","Next, we will enhance access as we deliver on our responsibility to create healthcare futures. We continue to be the undisputed leader in Specialty, where we offer one of the industry's broadest ranges of clinical trial support, consulting and commercialization services, data analytics and specialty product distribution.","We are successfully growing our customer share-of-wallet, driving increased compliance and rebalancing customer contracts to better reflect today's products mix. We are deepening our relationship with manufacturers and evolving how we work with them. At our recent ThinkLive manufacturer summit in October, we heard from our manufacturers that our services, data, and analytics are invaluable and they want to expand how they work with us. We're supporting their growth and ultimately enhancing patient access to critical medical treatments. And we are building on our own internal expertise and experience.","Success at AmerisourceBergen is not just that our businesses do well, it's that our businesses work together to collectively achieve so much more than they could separately. It's our Pharmaceutical Distribution group working with MWI Animal Health to optimize warehouse management systems and increase overnight distribution efficiency to about 20,000 distribution veterinary practices. It's MWI also working with our IT team to launch the next generation of its innovative e-commerce platform which is growing at two times the business's organic growth rate.","Third, we will drive performance and execute with our powerful corporate culture. AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver increased efficiency and effectiveness. Our automated distribution center network now includes five of the seven state-of-the-art DCs and we expect to bring the last two online in the next few months. And our near-term technology investments in new innovative systems are reshaping our business and how our customers interact with ABC while best positioning us to deliver value over the long-term.","The ABC order platform has been launched and is being hailed as a quantum leap forward in inventory management and ease of ordering for our independent community pharmacy customers. We are rolling out Fusion at Lash Group which is a dramatically changing the way and, importantly, the speed at which we facilitate patient prior authorization and reimbursement approvals for our manufacturer customers.","We also have key systems implementation underway for (15:19). And as I mentioned, are launching the next generation e-commerce platform for MWI Animal Health. Of course, key to driving performance and execution is the team. As I mentioned earlier, I truly believe that we have the best associates in the industry. The talent, dedication and expertise of our people are our greatest assets, and one of the very best things about working at AmerisourceBergen.","And fourth, we will continue to build advantage to drive growth and deliver value to shareholders. We have a long history of successful financial stewardship at AmerisourceBergen building on our proven ability to deliver value is a key corporate goal. We have forged some of the most strategic and longstanding customer partnerships in the industry. Our strong customer base provides a substantial foundation but also a platform for growth as we capture new volume and business, like Walgreen's, (16:16) and Rite Aid.","Finally, we have (16:21) advantage through strategic M&A and will continue to evaluate compelling opportunities in the future as we are open to making best-in-class, first-in-class value-driving acquisitions that will expand our strategic footprint.","In summary, AmerisourceBergen is strong. We are evolving, we are growing, and we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our associates are donating time to volunteer organizations of their choice. Our team is working in our local communities and our foundation is growing in size and supporting a broader range of critical programs. At AmerisourceBergen we think, plan and act strategically to accomplish our corporate goals, serve patients and build long-term sustainable shareholder value.","Now let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth look at our quarterly and full year financial results, as well as our financial guidance for fiscal year 2018. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results, and growth rates and comparisons that are made are against the prior-year quarter unless otherwise noted.","As Steve mentioned, we're very pleased with the progress we made this fiscal year, especially in several key areas such as improving generic compliance levels, resigning key customers like Express Scripts and, importantly, continuing to grow our specialty distribution and services businesses. Our continued execution has allowed us to successfully navigate in what has remained a challenging healthcare environment. We are confident that our overall strategy, combined with that ability to consistently execute will enable us to drive sustainable growth.","This morning I will provide commentary in three main areas. First, I will highlight our fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I will spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2017 full year performance. And the third area I will cover are fiscal 2018 expectations.","Let's begin with our Q4 2017 results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.33, an increase of 2% and in line with our expectations. As Steve highlighted, we're extremely pleased with our operations teams' comprehensive preparations and rapid coordinated response to the recent hurricanes. These efforts resulted in the safety of our associates and no major issues for our facilities. I should mention our revenues were slightly impacted from these events, including shipments from our PharMEDium facility in Sugar Land, Texas. Overall, our EPS was impacted, we estimate, by about $0.01.","Our consolidated revenues were $39 billion, up 4%, while having one less business day in the quarter compared to last year. We also continued unfortunately to experience a headwind from lower hepatitis C revenues this quarter, consistent with the overall U.S. market trends. As an illustration, excluding this headwind from hep C and also adjusting for the one less business day, our revenue growth would have been 7%.","Operating income; our adjusted operating income was $471 million, up $7 million or 1.5%, with our operating margin down four basis points. As expected, we had higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter. The expected costs associated with bringing our five new distribution centers on-line dampened our operating income growth, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the OpEx increase.","Moving below the operating income line, income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.5% for the current quarter, up some from last year. Unlike previous quarters this fiscal year, the current September quarter had an insignificant benefit from the accounting rule change regarding share-based compensation. I should also highlight that last year's September quarter had a favorable true-up adjustment for our 2016 tax expense. This caused a headwind in the current quarter of about 110 basis points on the tax rate.","Our adjusted net income decreased about 1% to $293 million, primarily as a result of the items I just covered, including the tax headwind. Our adjusted diluted share count decreased about 6.5 million shares or 3% year-over-year to 221 million shares. In the September quarter, we repurchased about $100 million worth of shares and we end the year with $790 million remaining on our current board share repurchase authorization.","Moving over to cash flow. We are extremely pleased with our Q4 free cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion, a record quarter. This was much better than we anticipated as a result of our revenue mix and also a heightened focus on our inventory levels and turns.","This finishes the review of our consolidated results. Next, let me switch and cover our segment results. Before I start, let me highlight that in conjunction with our transformation efforts and as highlighted in our press release this morning, we combined the Legacy Drug company and Legacy Specialty operating segments into a single operating segment, effective September 30, 2017. This conference call will be the last time I'll make any reference to the Specific Drug and Specialty businesses.","Additionally, we moved two of our businesses between our reportable segments. One of the businesses that moved, TheraCom distribution, a high revenue business with low margins within our consulting group and the other segment was moved to our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. As a result of these changes we have restated the segment results for all prior reported periods. These changes had an immaterial impact on segment operating results and will be fully highlighted in our 10-K.","With that, we can begin our review with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $3.7 billion up 4%. Legacy Drug Company had solid revenue growth up 4%; not only did this business have to lap lower hepatitis C revenues as we mentioned earlier, but the business continued to be disproportionately impacted from brand and generic conversions by certain large customers. As an example, the segment lost 140 basis points of revenue growth year-over-year from lower revenues associated with just the top three brand drugs that previously converted and had been holding share.","In the past, brand inflation provided a partial revenue offset to conversions. But inflation has been less impactful this year. And, I should point out with certain large customers upon conversion to the generic drug we do not always retain the prescription volume.","Our Legacy Specialty business which primarily distributes specialty drugs to physician practices continued with market leading revenue growth of just over 10% percent; notably the 15th consecutive quarter of this level of performance. Growth was driven by increased volumes especially in Oncology and to a lesser degree, in MS, Ophthalmology and Plasma. We continue to see strong volume and revenue growth from Immuno-oncology drugs due to expanded indications and overall market growth.","Segment operating income was $399 million and essentially flat. Our Legacy Specialty Group led the way with excellent growth which was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug company. Two items negatively impacted our Drug company business. The first item, last quarter we specifically highlighted that Q4 would have higher OpEx due primarily to the go-live dates of five distribution centers. The original go-live date for the DCs had been spring 2017 in order to coincide with the anticipated timing of the new Walgreen's Rite Aid business. Despite the deceleration of opening these DCs, the Drug company had to eventually bring the DCs online and was therefore burdened with some incremental OpEx ahead of onboarding the new business.","And the second item, our PharMEDium business experienced an increase in sequential shipping volumes in Q4, so we are pleased with their progress at increasing throughput while having best-in-class QC procedures. However, the business was still down in terms of year-over-year performance. Some of this headwind is timing related to lower demand at PharMEDium's Texas facility as a result of the Houston hurricane.","Overall, we are making progress in the Pharmaceutical Distribution services segment despite macro industry challenges. We continue to see growth in order lines shipped, including pro-generics order lines. We have an efficient modernized distribution network, and we've made key technology investments, most of which center around redefining the customer experience and enabling our customers to more effectively operate their businesses.","We can now move to the Other segment. This includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI, businesses that focus on global commercialization services and animal health. In the quarter total revenues were a record at just under $1.5 billion up about 12%. All three businesses contributed meaningfully to the revenue growth.","World Courier had a record number of shipments in the quarter. MWI had strong volume and revenue growth, especially in Companion Animal and to a lesser degree in Production Animal. From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $72 million up 8%. As a reminder, there is some seasonality in the MWI business with Q4 typically being their lowest profit quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the core fundamental of the three businesses in Other. All remain the undisputed market leaders in their effective sectors.","I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal 2017 full year consolidated financial items. Revenue; our full year growth was a solid 4%, and this includes a negative 130 basis points impact due to lower Hepatitis C revenues. Additionally, the current fiscal year had two less business days than the prior year, making for an unusual comparison. Adjusting for these two items, our overall revenue growth would have been 6.5%. As a note, in fiscal 2018, we will stay flat in terms of business days.","Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our Legacy Specialty business, finished the year at $31.5 billion, with revenue growth of just over 10%. Another outstanding year for this business. Our adjusted operating income was almost flat for the year, ending about 1% down at a total of roughly $2 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.32%, a decrease of six basis points.","While navigating a tough healthcare environment this year, we executed extremely well, especially in a priority area. We grew our PROGenerics business, with order lines up over 10% and made significant improvement in customer compliance rates. Unfortunately, this wasn't enough to fully offset gross profit headwinds from changes in manufacturer pricing practices and key customer renewals carried forward from fiscal 2016.","EPS; our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.88, up about 5%, due to operational execution and our ability to maintain our operating income level, despite the current market environment. And our EPS benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count. Free cash flow, as highlighted earlier; we had an exceptionally strong finish and this resulted in fiscal 2017 free cash flow of just over $1 billion. This free cash flow number is net of the $260 million litigation payment we made at the end of September. Excluding the litigation payment, our free cash flow was about 100% of our adjusted net income. We ended the year with roughly $2.4 billion in total cash, of which $1 billion was held offshore. We enter fiscal 2018 with great financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet. Our adjusted debt leverage is well under two times, and we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business and be opportunistic if strategic opportunities present themselves.","Now let's turn to fiscal 2018 expectations. Before I start working through the specific guidance items, I will comment on three key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand manufactured drug pricing. During fiscal 2017 our brand inflation finished right at 7%, and this includes fewer price increases and at lower rates in our fourth quarter. Based on these trends as we think about fiscal 2018, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to 6% to 7%.","Next, generic manufactured drug pricing. Current trends indicate that the generic buy side deflation rate has not worsened, which is a positive. Our deflation rate, which is calculated specifically for our business remains stable in the high single-digit percentage range. This elevated level presents a continued headwind that we need to work to offset, primarily achieved through increasing volumes and over the long-term, optimizing our margins for brand, specialty and generic drugs.","For fiscal 2018, we are forecasting that the generic buy side deflation range will remain a negative 7% to negative 9%. And finally, the third key working assumption, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-over-year. We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal 2018.","Revenues; we expect consolidated revenue growth in the 7% to 9% range. This growth includes the onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores which will happen over an extended time period and finish near the end of our third fiscal quarter. From a segment standpoint, both Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other are expected to grow in the same 7% to 9% range.","Consolidated gross profit; we don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our priorities continue to be one: grow our overall PROGenerics volumes. However, we expect that fiscal 2018 will be at a slower pace than fiscal 2017. Two: continue to source generic drugs cost effectively. Three: successfully and efficiently onboard the new Rite Aid business. And four: price appropriately to receive fair compensation. As always, it's our objective that these items will help offset assumed manufacturer pricing pressures.","Consolidated operating expenses; as mentioned last quarter in fiscal 2018, we will have a mismatch of certain operating expenses such as the new DC costs and duplicate IT costs before we are fully optimized with either additional run rate revenues or expected savings from technology efficiencies. Consequently, we expect OpEx growth in the range of 4% to 6% in fiscal 2018. As always, we remain diligent in managing our OpEx and continually look for ways to streamline and gain efficiencies, which is an imperative in a rapidly evolving U.S. healthcare market.","Consolidated adjustment operating income; we expect to grow operating income between 3% and 5%. Our operating margin will be down 2 to 7 basis points primarily due to mix, meaning higher growth rates within our largest customers.","Importantly, from a segment standpoint we expect the following.","Pharmaceutical Distribution Services; we remain in the midst of our efforts to transition customer contracts to more balanced pricing to help offset lower contributions from generics. As a result, we expect the segment's operating income growth to be also between 3% and 5%. The segment will benefit from the new Walgreens Rite Aid business, however given the anticipated onboarding schedule, it's likely that only the fourth fiscal quarter will have the full benefit of all the new pharmacies.","Commercialization Services and Animal Health; this group is a key differentiator for ABC and will remain so going forward. We're projecting continued strong growth for MWI and World Courier. However, for fiscal 2018, we do expect the group's overall growth will slow to 3% to 6% due to the timing of and the expected operating expenses associated with our full Fusion implementation.","Fusion is our new technology system in our Lash consulting business. The nature of any consulting business, including one like Lash Consulting, is that it requires new contract wins each year to maintain the normal course of running and ultimately growing the business. As we forecast the year, we are building in the impact the new platform will have on our customer capacity including converting existing customers. We are projecting a more limited business ramp for Lash during this Fusion transition period.","Our Fusion system is a game changer. It is a best-in-class patient support system that will provide a significant competitive advantage for Lash, be highly valued by our manufacturer partners, and also enable a better patient experience. And because of this we are confident that our Consulting business group will ramp at the end of fiscal 2018 and return to its normal level of growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Moving below the operating income line, tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of about 32% to 33%. This is a slightly higher tax rate versus fiscal 2017 due to one-time benefits from R&D tax credits that won't repeat in fiscal 2018, a higher mix of U.S. income, somewhat offset by continued tax initiatives.","Share repurchases; our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, generally enough to offset the dilutive impact from employee exercises. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.","Adjusted EPS; we expect our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.15. Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression. We expect our second half of fiscal 2018 EPS growth to be much better than our first half EPS growth, due primarily to the benefit of the gradual onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores as previously discussed.","Switching to our cash flow; first, CapEx is expected to be about $325 million. Roughly 60% of this CapEx spend relates to key projects that are being carried over from fiscal 2017 and, for the most part, will be completed during fiscal 2018. The projects include the completion of two remaining distribution centers and strategic technology system investments like ABC Order, our new customer order-entry system, Fusion which we just discussed, and Nova, our new logistics system which is the backbone of our World Courier business.","Free cash flow; we expect our free cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, for fiscal 2018 to be $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Revenue growth and mix between brand and generic sales, each of which have distinct cash conversion metrics, are the drivers that can move us within the range.","In closing, let me reiterate that we are actively investing in and advancing our business to address the evolving healthcare market. We want to be the most important partner to our customers, and a critical driver of their growth. Our people, services and systems are innovative and differentiate ABC, enabling us to deliver for our customers and importantly for our shareholders. We at AmerisourceBergen are proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2017, and we are looking forward to continuing to deliver in fiscal 2018. We appreciate your interest in ABC.","Now here is Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks. Tim. Operator, can we have the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question will be from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Remember please limit yourself to one question per queue. One moment, please.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Fits our model, and I don't think 100% conversion at the midpoint is a bad thing.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Sorry, can you start again? We didn't get a beginning, sorry.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Can you hear me now, Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, we can.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sorry, I don't know what's happening. Your free cash flow guidance bracketed us. I don't think 100% conversion is a bad thing, but some folks came off the last update thinking you firmly guided to 125% conversion. And, therefore, this guidance would be a couple hundred million-plus light. Are you happy with this guidance? Did something change to influence your cash flow guidance versus maybe your earlier intentions or goals? And then what are the major puts and takes this year that might prevent 125% conversion, which I know is your long-term target? Thanks very much.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. Hi, Eric. Good morning. It's Tim. Yes, our, we've been consistent. Our free cash flow target has been \u2013 adjusted free cash flow 125% of adjusted net income. We feel good about our target for fiscal 2018. I would say that our range maps to our target. And as you think about that range, the puts and takes, it certainly allows for revenue growth. I mean at the end of the day, two key factors would be the revenue growth and then certainly the mix of that revenue between brand and generic both of which have very distinct working capital metrics. So those are kind of the puts and takes, but we're pleased with our target. And as always, we'll work to achieve it.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Both in the prepared comments, Steve, as well as the comments around how to think about next year from Tim, you talked about contract conversion to offset generics. And what I'm thinking is, you've talked about this in the past, of separating out Specialty versus generics versus branded. Can you talk about where you are in that process of converting those contracts, number one? And number two, what are your expectations longer term as to what that can do for your margin profile?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. Hi, Lisa. Thanks for the question. We've been very focused on this for a while with the change in our business to where the Specialty products are becoming the brand business, and it's part of the reasons why we entered into the transformation process, which we're very excited about in terms of what it could mean for the customers particularly and streamlining our business. But about 90% of our brand business is covered by fee-for-services. And we are focused on making sure that we get fair compensation for the value provided. And those products are often \u2013 could be orphan drugs or indications that entitle them to a much higher WAC price without much discounting.","And we have to make sure that those products which are becoming a bigger and bigger weight of sales, not necessarily of units, that we do not lose money, or that we make money on them. And we've been very focused on that. And, that's been a long process with our customers. So you know, our contracts are anywhere between three to as much as seven years. So every time we cycle through the contracts we're making progress on that. But it's still probably another two years before that discussion's been had with every single customer, I'd say. Thank you Lisa.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for the question. Yes, there's still a lot of questions out there around what different participants are seeing with regards to generic pricing. While generic pricing seems to have played out, looks like much of the way you guys expected to see it play out in 2017 and based on your guidance, looks like you're thinking it's going to remain pretty consistent into 2018. Was hoping you could just maybe help us bridge the gap on what you're seeing from generic pricing relative to what a lot of these generic manufacturers are conveying as far as what they're seeing on generic pricing. I'm sure you saw Teva out this morning with another negative pricing update. So just hoping you could maybe square those differing views to us.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. I mean, as big as Teva is and they're a really significant part of our portfolio, this is really our own portfolio, Bob. It's \u2013 so it really is unique to us and it's affected by who participants in ProGen in particular. But we are seeing that 7% to 9% range and has been towards the top end; one would hope it would start to turn. This is the third year we're now dealing with this and it's a significant headwind. It really has been. We've done such a good job with growing the unit sales and our compliance rates have really increased.","And, it just helps you stand to do a little bit better in your overall generic sales, which despite my answer, at least there's profit, no question about our profit mix. It's still very, very essential profit driver for us. And so a lower deflation rate is probably the biggest upside we have in so many ways, it impacts us in so many ways. So we'd like to see that that generic deflation rate come down even to the lower end of our guidance, 7%, would be very helpful. Thanks.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","And that will come from the line of George Hill with RBC. Go ahead.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm wondering, can you provide any more color on what's exactly baked in for fiscal 2018 as we think about the Rite Aid contribution? You talked about the year being back-half loaded. I didn't know if there was any more color that you could provide around the revenue guidance or the operating income contribution or maybe even just the volume contribution would be helpful.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. Thanks, George, for the question and good morning. On Rite Aid, we \u2013 in Steve's script, I think he called out that we're already starting to ship to a few stores, we'll onboard. We'll see a pickup. We'll see a pickup on that onboarding in calendar 2018. We'll be done onboarding in spring, so really before our June quarter. And I think it's important. I mean, I called out that really, the fourth quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter, is really the first quarter that we'll have all the volume. And so again, it's helpful. It's certainly helpful. It's a part of our revenue growth. And I \u2013 but I think we're really pleased with our guidance. Our revenue growth is 7% to 9%. That's only \u2013 that's a portion of it, but if you take out Rite Aid, we're really pleased that we're still growing significantly above the market, especially in our Specialty business.","Operator","And we'll next...","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, can we have another question, please.","Operator","Yes. It will come from the line of Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Co. Go ahead, please.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. A question around why no \u2013 in the guidance, there are no share buybacks. Is that just conservative language or is there a reason why you don't expect to repurchase any stock in fiscal 2018?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Oh, no. Kevin, that \u2013 this is Tim. I'm jumping in. Certainly, we guided for modest capital deployments in the share repurchase area. As we do every year, we always enter the year assuming that we will do an amount that will offset the dilutive impact. So our working assumption always entering the year is to make sure we keep our share count flat. That's our commitment. And then during the year, depending on cash flow and other priorities, we'll adjust accordingly.","Operator","I'll go next to the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, hey thanks for taking the question. And I apologize if I missed this earlier. When we think about the guidance too, what about volumes into WBAD, such as coming in from Express Scripts. Have you made any adjustments or is anything embedded in your expectations for that? And then just to follow up on that Rite Aid question earlier, is there any type of lag in terms of when Walgreens takes the stores on how immediately would the distribution piece shift over or is there any type of transition period where you would \u2013 (47:13) would continue to serve the stores, even though Walgreens was operating them, before they could switch over to you for distribution? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We heard that, the train beeped a lot of your question. That was about the longest (47:24) I've heard. But no, let me just start with Rite Aid and then we'll answer the WBAD Express Scripts. So we will begin shipping to Rite Aid in this quarter, to some of the Rite Aid stores in this quarter, the ones that will be acquired by WBA, not the legacy Rite Aids of course, and it will be phased in through the spring of 2018. So it has been incorporated into our fiscal year guidance, and it will ramp more in the second half of fiscal year 2018. It'll be very important.","You know, as far as Express Scripts joining WBAD, that's nothing that would have impacted our guidance yet. It really is an opportunity. I think right now we focused on helping onboard them successfully, but the bulk of the work is really being done between WBAD and Express Scripts for the moment, but we remain mindful that once that is all operationalized, that this could be an opportunity for us, and we continue to believe that this is a positive opportunity in the long run for us.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Go ahead, please.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on Amazon. Obviously, a key topic in terms of how you think, what the strategy is there for playing defense. And also, as we think about your medical supply and med device distribution business, what exactly, if you don't mind sizing that, again, given the Amazon risk in the background. Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. So after this, we have our associates call and we get some questions in to be ready, that they're asked so that we can cover them. All eight questions are on this particular question. So it's certainly not only captured the imagination of sell-side and other industry commentators, but of course even our internal associates.","So we are always interested and aware of what competitive threats could come in, and we face them, say, on a technology front in some of our commercialization, the Lash businesses. And we distribute to probably, it's close to 100,000 sites between all the different companies that we have within AmerisourceBergen. When you think about even a Besse and a PharMEDium, the amount of distribution we're doing is enormous, but it doesn't scale compared to probably a couple of million households that Amazon does.","But I think that you just look at what we do as distribution really simplifies and degrades what is a very complex service that we provide specifically focused on pharmaceutical care. Just as a reminder, AmerisourceBergen is not big in medical supplies or medical products. So we haven't really encountered Amazon at all yet as a threat. I look at an (50:28) for a year or so now that they could be a potential customer for us. Many, many years ago, I'm sure that wholesalers had the argument should they service mail order facilities. So it could be an emerging customer opportunity.","The pharmaceutical licenses that, we think that's about the B2B business in medical, we think that this again is a very complex area. For example, our recently opened Olive Branch facility, we needed 70 licenses. Do I think that a company that can start this ASW would have a problem getting 70 licenses? Absolutely not, but I do think that the generation of services that we provide, say to community pharmacy, these are not services that are easily replicable. When you look at the smaller customers that maybe are more of the natural customer base, these are the customers that are most reliant on AmerisourceBergen for terms, for data, for connectivity to third-party payers, for merchandising, for business coaching, for patient refill reminders. I mean, it goes on and on.","So I think the point is that we have these prime vendor contracts, we're very tied-in from a marketing and branding perspective, with a lot of the smaller customers, not only in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, but also in areas like MWI and oncology supply. Our manufacturers rely on our data and our secure supply chain and logistics, and this whole \u2013 just if you want to look at another area where I think it adds to complexity of what we do, the evolving standard on opioids is another example of where it's a very specific pharmaceutical care function that we do, and we don't think that we are descaled. It's hardly like you're talking about Wal-Mart coming in and going against a regional hardware supply distributor many, many years ago. So just to summarize because we know this is a key question, we are much more than a wholesaler. We provide key services that are very healthcare and pharmaceutical specific to our customers. Tim, I did a filibuster but please add anything.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. Steve, that was awesome, and I would just say, just remind our listeners, again we are not only ABC but the sector. We are extremely efficient at what we do for a very fair margin and taking title. And also I think we continue to invest. Again, we're on a little bit of the offensive here, where we continue to invest in leading edge solutions to service our customers and ultimately the patients even better.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Go ahead, please.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. What are your comments if you have any on this generic pricing collusion? It would appear the whole channel is named. And what's your perspective on that? And what kind of traffic have you had with the folks that are lobbing these accusations? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I have my General Counsel right next to me, and he's shaking his head. But, John, we really can't comment on that at all, so...","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, I would just say, John, the one thing, and we've always said this, we've been very consistent, there's certainly a firewall between ABC and a wholesaler and manufacturers in terms of pricing. We're notified. They send us e-Mails and PDFs when they adjust pricing and that's when we learn about it. At that point.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator can we move through? We have time for maybe two or three more questions.","Operator","Absolutely. We'll go next to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Can you comment just on what you're seeing on the sell-side environment? I think you spoke about compliance, but how you are seeing competition? How did that compare to earlier in the year? And what are your expectation as they embedded in the guidance?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Ricky, we called this out at the beginning of 2017 and it's the same for 2018. We really don't have a lot of renewals. It seems that this always goes in waves, and 2016 and the beginning of 2017 were, but we had that already under contract with big renewals for us. So we were not involved in any large renewals such as Kaiser and CPA which we had the year before Express Scripts.","So, and again with 2018, we have very little in renewal. But I think that people are understanding the things the market has really understood now with solid communication, I think from our industry, about the shift to very high end often specialty products, or really clinically differentiated, or the Immune-oncology products; these are very, very big drivers of our business. And you know what I experienced in all the years I was running Specialty was more line item pricing and in the drug wholesale business I'd say that's not really line item pricing, but it's category pricing. You have to look at these products as categories, and I think our industry is clearly moving to that. And, the more the customers can understand that, it's better. So we see this pricing as being very stable but competitive as always. So thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","That will be from David Larsen with Leerink. Go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, Tim. Can you talk about your operating expense growth assumptions and if you brought the five DCs online, were any of those costs recorded in like fiscal 1Q, 2Q, or 3Q of this year? And then will those costs abate as you head into fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yep, hi, Dave. Good morning. We had a little bit of a cost in Q3 again sequentially, but the DCs were not open for the entire third quarter. When we got to the fourth quarter, we had all five DCs virtually open. The costs don't abate as we move forward. That's kind of the run rate for those five new DCs entering into 2018. But, again, I think the key point there is we start to have new revenue and Rite-Aid revenue also coming on. So there's just a better match of revenue and OpEx.","So hopefully that answers your question. But when we, last time we gave our earnings back in, for Q3, we thought that maybe our OpEx in 2018 would be slightly higher. Again, we weren't done with our plan process. We commented on that on the last call. We've gone back to businesses. We've worked hard. We pressure tested and we're really pleased with our OpEx growth for 2018 of 4% to 6%.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank","Yes. Thanks. Tim, maybe if I could just follow up on that expense question. I think in your prepared remarks, you said that your CapEx guidance was $325 million and 60% of that or almost $200 million was related to these transformation-type investments. So I heard your answer to the previous question that maybe some of those expenses will continue into fiscal 2018 as you bring those DCs online. But how do we think about those operating expenses on a go-forward basis, particularly around the IT investments? Is there some portion of that 60% that's related to the transformation that's one-time that will ultimately go away?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Glen, and welcome back. The way to think about it, we, the 4% to 6%, at one point \u2013 again, I kind of go back to the June quarter, we thought there might be some transformation OpEx that we might need. Nothing is contemplated right now. We, at this point, we don't think we need anything. So it's not in that 4% to 6%. But I think importantly, as you think about our OpEx, we're not \u2013 again, 4% to 6% is high. I mean we're in an evolving healthcare market. We need to do better than 4% to 6% and that's our objective. So we're going see that 4% to 6% in fiscal 2018. As we move into fiscal 2019, that should come down to what I would say should be a more normalized rate because we start to eliminate duplicate systems and we start to gain efficiency. So clearly, our objective is to move into 2019 and start to realize the benefits from all that CapEx that we've had.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Glen. And, operator, I think we have time for just one more question.","Operator","Indeed. That will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron. Go ahead.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. I want to follow up on the questions on obtaining a fair margin across classes. It sounded like \u2013 you used the word customers and it sounded like that was largely sell-side focused. How much of the effort is focused on the manufacturer and the buy side? And as we look out to fiscal year 2018, is the movement of Specialty through the mainline distributor still a negative impact on margin overall? Are we seeing that Specialty continues to weigh on margins even as it may contribute to absolute gross profit?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, Eric. Thank you. It's a really excellent question. So we do have a lot of discussions with the manufacturers. I mean there is consolidation in the industry and manufacturers like Pfizer are getting into biosimilars and immuno-oncology products and Merck. So there's a lot of cause for discussion and we have a team that's focused on it. Those are good discussions about what can we do with our commercialization businesses, as well as the traditional wholesale business and maintaining a fair fee for service. And I think what we would always say is we have these prime vendor contracts that are structured and are along several years. And so we need to work within the parameters of that. And I think manufacturers certainly understand our business and the contribution we have. It's a excellent question. We're very focused on both the buy and sell-side contracting. Tim, was there other part of the question you want to answer?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No. I think Steve, well said. I mean certainly, we're focused on sell-side. We've talked about that, communicated. We're make really good progress. As Steve mentioned earlier, I think in Q&A, we have more room to go there. But again, we just need to make sure we get fair compensation for each category class of drugs that we sell the customer and those are ongoing discussions. We're making progress.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. And, Eric, I think the other part of your question was really specialty products that are going to mail order specialty pharmacies. And those tend to be very aggregated and often they are only given to a handful of pharmacies of which our U.S. buyer can sometimes be one. So we have adapted to this marketplace, but it could be a profit. It is a mix challenge because those are not our highest-margin products.","However, I will tell you that we are seeing a surge in physician-administered products again, and we had the potential hospital outpatient changes yesterday. So I've been around this for nearly 25 years now, and I think things change and the importance of the physician marketplace not only to AmerisourceBergen but to the patients is very, very fundamental. And I think we're seeing those products have strong pipelines. And we're very excited to see that. And AmerisourceBergen has so many wonderful businesses that have had a great history that'll be really are adapted around services to the physicians. So I think we have some very positive trends as well.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","So with that, the question from Eric. I think we've got a lot of ground covered today. I believe fiscal year 2017 will be remembered for our capital investments. The conclusion on Rite-Aid, for our ability to execute and deliver long term value. So this is Tim's fifth year as CFO, and we told the board we've hit our EPS guidance every year, and so we're very proud of that.","And our fiscal year 2018 we're excited that it's begun. The team is executing well and I think we'll be judged on how well we do on transformation and manage our key customers and key supplier relationships. So we have a lot of confidence that we'll do that very expertly as you can always expect from AmerisourceBergen.

Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our second quarter of fiscal 2015. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2014 and other filings. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the company.","","As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered outstanding financial results in our second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $32.7 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 36% to $1.45 while we generated a very strong $700 million in operating cash flow. In addition to the excellent financial and operating performance, we also made important progress against our strategic objectives as we closed of acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and we extended our contract with our large PBM customer for an additional year.","","The strength of our core business, combined with our disciplined capital management, gives us the flexibility to continue to expand our knowledge, reach and partnership as we broaden our provider and manufacturer service offerings to new market segments and continue to drive innovation across the pharmaceutical supply channel. We've had an exceptional first half of fiscal 2015, and we are very well positioned to meet our increased expectations for the full year.","Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the March quarter. Holding on to momentum we had coming out of our first quarter, our performance in the second quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth, and continuing improvement in working capital led to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units.","","AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter with revenues up 15% even as we continued to anniversary the Walgreens brand business and some of the generic business. Good organic growth rates overcame the roll-off of some old business, and sales of the new hepatitis C drugs also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. Overall, drug pricing trends remain favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments.","","We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health system and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Our diverse customer base helps us to ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long-established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships help ensure our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care. This footprint is a tremendous strategic and tactical value, both for those launching new products and for those providing daily care to patients.","","To have a trusted partner who has a key role in improving patient access to pharmaceuticals is critical in a health care system that is rapidly evolving with each passing day. And having a partner who works collaboratively to maximize efficiency and reach is essential in a market with increasing demand and decreasing resources. Our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is progressing very well. Sales of brand and generic products to Walgreens stores are growing faster than expected, and we are very pleased with the economic contributions from the sourcing JV. Our relationship evolves along with the markets we both serve, and we are continuously working collaboratively to enhance the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers.","","On the international front in our drug distribution business, our BluePoint private label program is performing well, and we achieved an important milestone this quarter as we launched our first generic injectable product under the BluePoint label. Activities in ABC Switzerland are well under way, and we -- and are beginning to contribute value to both ABC and to the manufacturers we serve. ABC Switzerland functions as an intermediary for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, managing strategic relationships and fostering specific new value-added activities. It provides enhanced data analytics and market intelligence to assist manufacturers with their supply chain effectiveness and serves as a platform to manage and grow PROGenerics, our proprietary generics formulary, and other global generic programs. Moreover, the location and timezone of ABC Switzerland facilitates coordination and activity with our partners at WBAD. We are very pleased with the progress we have made as we have expanded our international presence while improving the services we offer our partners.","In the U.S., we continue to ramp activity at our National Distribution Center in Columbus. We have more than doubled the volume going through the facility during the March quarter, and we will continue to add additional manufacturers to its programs over the remainder of the fiscal year. All of these activities are great examples of new efficiencies and innovations that wholesalers bring to the supply chain and of the specific value AmerisourceBergen brings to the table.","","ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some manufacturing process changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up 16%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASP was again particularly strong in the March quarter. Our community oncology business performed well in the March quarter due to a mix of new business, some brand oncology product price increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persist, we are very pleased that the community oncology market stabilized, which we believe is a great benefit for overall cancer care. Oncology care will continue to be provided across various health care venues, and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain at the forefront of cancer care.","","I have also noted that our individual business units increasingly become less distinct from one another while focusing their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. Our leadership team is focused on achieving enterprise-wide solutions that will impact our customers and enhance our competitive position. Nowhere is this more evident than in the specialty area where the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and health care providers manage the opportunity and challenges of this dynamic segment of the market. We have spent virtually decades carefully developing our portfolio of specialty offerings and building up the capabilities necessary to handle complex products with special needs. We extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products. We definitely meet the needs of physicians, clinics and health systems, and we have pioneered the development of commercialization and reimbursement consulting services and patient access and adherence programs.","","All of the work we have done and investments we have made in our facilities, our people and our technology has been done in an effort to collaboratively meet the needs of biotech innovators, established pharmaceutical companies and of physician and other providers who administer these life-changing therapies, which positively impacts the lives of the patients we all ultimately serve.","Whether we are dealing with a new brand of chemical or biological product, a generic version of a mature therapy or a promising growth area such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the unique expertise and the right portfolio required to help ensure the widest market for a product, the greatest patient access and the most varied support services, all conducted in an extremely efficient manner that generates tremendous value for all stakeholders.","","As consolidation and the economic realities of health reform drive even more focus on the specialty product segment, I've never felt more confident that AmerisourceBergen is the best positioned partner for our various stakeholders to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products.","Now let me say a few words about biosimilars specifically, which are understandably generating a great deal of attention. We believe that the introduction of biosimilars to U.S. market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further demonstrate our strengths in these areas. While we cannot be certain of the timing of biosimilar introductions and many other questions still remain regarding the pricing of products, the degree of substitutability and the specific mechanisms of reimbursement, we are looking forward to working with our partners to ensure that patients will be the ultimate beneficiary of the introduction of biosimilars. We have the widest access possible to these products. The majority of the benefits from biosimilars are still largely a ways off, but we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new category of products.","As we look ahead, we are thrilled to extend the distribution and specialty expertise we have accumulated into the animal health space. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the MWI transaction in late February, and we are pleased officially welcome Jim Cleary, Mary Pat Thompson and the rest of the MWI team to AmerisourceBergen. Jim is now a member of my executive lead team, and the integration is off to a terrific start. Our results in this quarter include about 1 month of MWI's results, which were ahead of our expectations. We remain quite confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and that we will meet our targets for synergy capture as planned. MWI's results are now reported under our Other segment, along with our Consulting business and World Courier.","Coincidentally, today marks the third year anniversary since we closed our World Courier transaction. World Courier has helped us think globally, and we have together exceeded so many of the integration and strategic goals we laid out in our business case. Congratulations to all the associates at World Courier on their third anniversary of joining AmerisourceBergen.","All the manufacturer services businesses together had a solid March quarter. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas, our increasingly global reach and our experience in developing patient access and adherence program is a differentiator for AmerisourceBergen today and an opportunity for growth in the future, particularly as biosimilars begin to come to market.","It is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The combination of a pipeline full of innovative products and expanding access to health care drives meaningful improvement in patients' lives and growth opportunities across the pharmaceutical supply channel. As we have previously discussed, many of these same growth trends hold true for the animal health market as well. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. As Americans age, pet ownership is increasing and pets themselves are living longer, thanks to improvements in pharmaceutical care and advanced procedures that enhance the lives of pets. In addition, the increasing global demand for food drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. into developing global markets.","","Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Our year-over-year comparisons are much more difficult in the next 2 quarters, while our underlying business trends remain strong. For example, as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will gradually begin to fully anniversary the benefits from the Walgreens generic business and the contributions from the sourcing joint venture. In addition, we need a substantial amount of generic inflation in the next 2 quarters just to match what we experienced in the prior year. Brand inflation has been quite strong in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2015, and we are seeing some brand price increases on specialty products that likely won't recur in the second half of the year. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium launch in the March quarter, there remains only one generic supplier. So the economic value of the product for ABC is not optimal.","","Given these trends, our performance in the March quarter and the addition of MWI, we have raised our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tim will provide greater detail. But in summary, and on a consolidated basis, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 12% to 13%, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 22% to 25% and free cash flow generation in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion.","As we reported in our press release this morning, our board has authorized a new $1 billion special share repurchase program designed to further offset the potential dilution from the future exercise of the warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance. As we approach the exercise dates on these warrants, we will continue to evaluate our efforts to offset the dilutive impact of exercise and explore a variety of approaches to offset the dilutive impact of exercises -- I beg your pardon, and explore a variety of approaches to achieve our desired outcome, including through possible M&A. In addition to activity under the special program, we continue to expect to repurchase $200 million under our normal repurchase program.","I'm very pleased with the outstanding financial and operating performance we achieved across our entire business in the first half of fiscal 2015. While there are many moving parts in the remainder of the year, I'm confident that we will meet our financial and operational objectives for the year. As I said last quarter, generating strong business results requires more than meeting financial and operating goals. True value creation results from stellar execution, innovative thinking and the bold implementation of new ideas. I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers' expectations by partnering with them to find creative new ways to meet current and future challenges. The tremendous strength of our now expanded core business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build and to make vital contributions to the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of human and animal customers and, by so doing, continue to provide excellent returns to our stakeholders.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our second fiscal quarter ended March 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted.","","I have 3 topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I will also cover our consolidated cash flow highlights. As Steve mentioned, this is our first period that our results include MWI, which essentially means one month of their activity. The second topic, I will spend a few minutes covering our warrant hedging progress to date. And the last topic, I will cover our revised fiscal '15 expectations.","So with that, we can begin our Q2 review. Revenues were $32.7 billion, up nearly 15%. On an overall basis, Walgreens accounted for just under half of that revenue growth. This is our second quarter of having all of this business, meaning their brand and generic volumes, for the entire quarter. So a majority of this customer growth is due to the year-over-year ramping of the business. I should highlight that the addition of MWI contributed about 1% to our overall growth rate.","","The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 25% to just over $1 billion. The strong growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven primarily by better-than-expected revenue growth, especially generics.","Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased about 18% to approximately $490 million. Excluding MWI, our operating expense growth would have been 11%, and roughly 2% of this growth was related to compensation accruals needed due to our year-to-date performance versus our internal plan. Consistent with past quarters, the remaining expense growth relates to higher overall business volumes and IT expenses.","","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $553 million, up about $136 million or a very strong 33% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 23 basis points.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense, net, was about $21 million and included $5.5 million of interest and fee associated with the MWI financing for roughly 5 weeks in the quarter.","","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 35.7% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. Growth in World Courier, BluePoint private label and now our Switzerland manufacturer services business is causing a change in our U.S.-to-international income mix and is consequently lowering our consolidated tax rate. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.","","For the quarter, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 37% to $1.45, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230.4 million shares, down just under 2%.","Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $31.8 billion, up 14%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Companies led the way with a 13% revenue increase.","","Our revenue growth in our core drug business was driven by 3 items: market growth -- one, market growth continues to be good, driven by volume, strong pricing and the new hepatitis C drugs; two, our sales to our largest customer exceeded our expectations; and three, as mentioned before, we haven't anniversary-ed the full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize this revenue benefit.","","In terms of mix, Drug Company's total generic revenues increased nearly 50% year-over-year in dollars. Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 25%. And similar to last quarter, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues on a comparable basis, our specialty business grew an impressive 16% with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We continue to see solid growth in our community oncology business with a percentage growth rate in the high single digits. And, finally, our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth, contributing about 1\/3 of the 16% comparable growth rate due to new business wins and increased volumes. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before intrasegment eliminations, consistent with how we've reported these growth rates in past quarters.","Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $849 million, up about 22%. Drug Company was the driver of a majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth, and, as I've called out, especially due to higher generic revenues.","","In terms of total segment price appreciation, we ended the quarter higher than we expected in terms of dollar contribution. We were better than expected in the contribution for brand inflation, and this more than offset being slightly lower on the benefit from generic inflation.","","Operating expenses were $361 million and were up about 12%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting this segment's significant volume growth. OpEx also includes the additional incentive compensation accruals primarily related to strong performance of the 2 businesses in this segment.","","Segment operating income was $489 million and up about 31%, driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we're also extremely pleased with our specialty business with an operating income growth rate in the high teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio.","We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and, beginning in this quarter, MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $986 million, up 72%. Excluding the impact of MWI, the revenue growth would have been slightly less than 20% with most of this coming from our Consulting business and specifically the TheraCom distribution business. MWI had a very good revenue month primarily as a result of its companion animal business. Positive trends in the industry, including new innovative drugs and increased visits to vet practices, are driving high companion animal revenue growth. During this period, production animal revenues were up modestly, impacted primarily by cattle feedlot placements being down year-over-year.","","From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $64 million, reflecting growth of 47%. The segment's growth benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results.","Let me highlight from a margin standpoint. MWI's margin was better this period versus what they've had historically due to having a better mix of companion animal revenue.","","This completes our segment review. Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO.","","Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased significantly to $2.7 billion as of March 31. This increase in value was correlated to the 26% increase in the ABC share price during the March quarter. Our GAAP warrant expense was $753 million for the quarter, and roughly 75% of this expense represented a cumulative adjustment as the accounting rules require ABC to record expense as if the $2.7 billion fair value was the fair value back on day 1 of warrant issuance.","","LIFO this quarter, we recorded an expense of $151 million. This means on a year-to-date basis, we have recorded about half of our full year estimates of $586 million, which is slightly greater than our estimates for the first fiscal quarter.","","This wraps up our P&L review, and let me switch and cover cash.","","This quarter, we again had very good free cash flow, $690 million. As I highlighted earlier, a significant increase in generic revenues, about 50% year-over-year, continue to drive improved working capital metrics. Specifically, our DPO or days payable to suppliers, improved about 6 days from last year. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.3 billion, which was very good considering we partially funded the MWI acquisition and also continued with our warrant hedging activities.","As I mentioned in my opening comments, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our second topic, warrant hedging. As we talk to investors, we are receiving a number of warrant questions, especially now that the first opportunity for Walgreens Boots Alliance to exercise is less than a year away, March 2016. As a reminder, the 2016 and 2017 warrants each represent an option to buy approximately 23 million shares. ABC will receive roughly $1.2 billion in proceeds at the time of each exercise.","","To date, we have used 3 strategies to offset the expected warrant dilution. The first strategy: we entered into the original capped call that can be exercised by ABC. In 2016 and 2017, we plan to use 60% of the warrant proceeds to fund the exercise of these capped calls. The second strategy: we have repurchased 5.1 million shares to date under our special share repurchase program. The third strategy: in the March 2015 quarter, we purchased call options for 6 million shares for $80 million. We have the right to exercise the option during designated time periods between April 2015 and the end of October 2015. Funding these exercises will require the use of capital of approximately $570 million. The average strike price of the call options is $95.","Let me switch gears and address warrant coverage. First, the 2016 warrants. At March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, which was $113.67, the capped calls covered 46% of the expected dilution. Adding the 1.51 million shares already repurchased, we come about 70% hedged on the 2016 warrants. Now looking forward and assuming we successfully exercise the call options representing 6 million shares, we move to 95% hedged.","","For the 2017 warrants, again at March 31 and based on our closing share price on that date, the capped calls covered 42% of the expected dilution. We have not completed any other share repurchases or hedging activities related to the 2017 warrants yet.","","To enable our investors to better track our coverage as our share price changes, I'd like to highlight that for every $5 increase from our March 31 closing share price, our total hedging coverage on each warrant will decrease by about 2%. Likewise, if our share price decreases by $5, our total coverage will increase by about 2% on each warrant.","","As a reminder, premiums paid for call options are not expensed in our P&L. They directly impact our equity account. And shares specifically earmarked for hedging are not included in our adjusted share count for EPS purposes. We will net these shares into the adjusted share count when the new shares are issued at the time of warrant exercise.","So to summarize this section, ABC remains committed to offsetting expected dilution in our adjusted EPS from the warrant exercises. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital deployment, including repurchasing shares and other hedging activity, as well as looking for other means to fill the EPS gap from the warrant dilution, including strategic M&A.","","Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our revised fiscal '15 expectations. My guidance comments will now include MWI.","","Revenues. Based on positive trends in our business and also the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 12% to 13% range. MWI is expected to account for about 2% for this growth.","","Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be in the range of 19% to 21%, driven by our first half performance, stronger full year revenues, especially generics, and adding MWI.","","Operating margin. We now expect that our operating margin will be up 8 to 10 basis points due to the performance of our business and mix with MWI having a higher margin in our drug and specialty businesses.","","Our adjusted dilution share count for the full year is expected to be down just under 1% due to exercises under employee stock compensation plan and reduced share buybacks. In fact, we expect our Q3 and Q4 adjusted share count to be higher on a year-over-year basis.","","Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which reflects growth of 22% to 25% from last year's adjusted EPS. As we have said on prior investor calls, even though the second half of the year will include the contribution from MWI, we have a very tough EPS comparable due to strong generic price appreciation last year, we also begin to anniversary the Walgreens contribution and our renewed contract with the Department of Defense starts with revised market pricing.","Share repurchases. Our guidance for regular share repurchases remains at $200 million for the full year.","","Switching to our free cash flow guidance. Due to the combination of strong generic revenue growth and generics having positive working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion.","I would like to make one final comment about share repurchases and our share count. Historically, we've committed to deploying $400 million to $500 million for share repurchases in a given year subject to market conditions and other uses of cash like M&A. When we had a much lower share price, we were able to both offset employee stock option exercises and reduce our overall share count. As a reference point, our employee stock exercises can be roughly 2% of our outstanding shares in a given year. Going forward, due to our current share price, we will be challenged to just keep our adjusted share count flat while deploying the same approximate dollars.","As I wrap up, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. I've covered several key areas, and I hope you found this information helpful.","","At the halfway point of our fiscal year, we are executing very well. We are working to integrate our new business, MWI, and we are thrilled with progress to date. And we remain committed to making the right long-term investment to continue to grow our earnings.","Thank you for your interest in ABC. And now here's Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Barbara A. Brungess","[Operator Instructions] Tony, please go ahead with our first question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, it looks like you've reupped the contract -- the PBM contract, for another year. Just curious, was that just a pickup of the -- kind of a 1-year option associated with it? Why not a longer-term extension there?","Steven H. Collis","Well, the option was Express' option. And we believe we have a good relationship. We believe it's constantly improving. And we're confident that there will be more opportunities to carry on strengthening the relationship in the future, so. Anything, Tim?","Tim G. Guttman","No, we look forward to working with them over the next several months and getting something deeper and longer term. You're right, Steve.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Bob. Next question, please.","Operator","It'll come from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, I appreciate all the details on the warrant hedging strategy, and I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. It kind of sounds like that for the '16 warrants, you almost feel like you're fully hedged at this point, so we shouldn't expect any dilution. But for '17, it kind of sounds like with the original capped call, you're probably about 40% hedged. So if I'm kind of doing the math correctly as it stands kind of right now at the existing stock price, maybe you're looking at kind of the mid-single-digit dilution in 2017 if you do nothing else at this point. Is that a fair assessment?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, I would say, Glen, that you're right. We've made -- we're really pleased with progress we've made on '16. We feel like we're kind of in the homestretch here on '15 and we'll make some further progress. That's one of our key areas for cash deployment to take care of that. '17 we have a gap, and we'll take a look at that. And I stand by the comments I made and Steve makes that we're committed to closing that EPS gap, and we have a ways to go.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so, Steve, maybe if I just follow up on closing that EPS gap. It sounds like one of the strategies you suggested you might use is M&A. Given that you're only a month into the MWI deal, where do you feel like you are from an integration standpoint? Do you feel like the company's at a point where it can actually deploy more capital towards M&A at this point?","Steven H. Collis","Well, we have very good cash flow, Glen. And certainly, I think we've been very thoughtful of M&A. If you look at the Other sector and you see the 3 signature acquisitions that we made since I became CEO, I think all of them have really differentiated us from a service perspective but also from a financial and margin perspective. The MWI franchise is really awesome, and there's opportunities for regional consolidation, opportunities for international expansion, opportunities to add more value-added services to this revised [ph] segment. So it's quite an intriguing opportunity to enter that franchise with more capital deployment. I also think we did a very thorough due diligence. But it's the first public company I've been involved in acquiring and there was a lot of information. But it's just -- it's an incredible franchise and we're very, very pleased to have this within ABC. And I think the manufacturers are pleased to have our partnering as we look to -- towards further expanding the model, both internationally and domestically.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Glen. Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's just a broader-level question. So if you look at the recent headlines and also comments from this morning, consolidation among manufacturers and branded price inflation continue to be key trends. So how do you, as part of WBAD, contemplate these trends? And where -- had you remained independent, so to speak, you would not have been able to benefit from. Is there any sort of a structural change when it comes to the branded manufacturers? And also on the consolidation front, advantages you now have that you would not have had.","Steven H. Collis","Well, on the branded, we don't do that through WBAD. So we have opportunities for enhanced services when it comes to the areas like specialty, data and Good Neighbor Pharmacy in Alphega that is an opportunity we have in branded. But certainly, on the contractual side, it's really around oral solid generics. And we believe that we have the most global approach. If you look at all the different portfolios of business that are residents in WBAD, they really are a unique collection of assets. And at the time, I think we maintained very strongly that it was very hard for others to match this portfolio of assets. And I think that has become even more so since -- as time has evolved. So I was just in a TDS convention, met with all the global heads and U.S. heads of just about every big generic company, and I believe we're very well positioned. Certainly, generic price increases are something that has added a little bit of upside to our performance, as there's variability from quarter to quarter, which we try to point out to the best of our ability as -- given that we want you to have full understanding of our financials. We've got a good headwind in the next 2 quarters. But we -- the challenge with our customers, all of them and particularly I've been talking here about the ProGen customers, is to get those reimbursement tables changed quicker. And that's what we really are focused on through Good Neighbor Pharmacy Provider Network and other resources that AmerisourceBergen has. And I think certainly, the larger customers like WBA have their own resources around this area, but we'll always work constructively to face the market together.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. You've made some comments regarding inflation required to meet last year's rates. So what are your current branded and generic inflation assumptions in the updated guidance that you've given?","Steven H. Collis","Do you want to take it?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I can start, Steve. We remain the same on our guidance, as we have said. I mean, we -- we're still at flat in terms of dollar contribution for the year. Sequentially, I'd like to point out sequentially, we were down some between our first fiscal quarter and second, and I think the comment was we would need to see a little bit of an uptick for the second half of the year to get to our expectations. And again the point is, last year, if you'll remember, last June and September quarters, we had very strong price appreciation on the generics side as a comparable year-on-year.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. And then on the brand side, we were about 10% to 11% where we were last year, consistent with IMS data. So we did see some good mix in the last quarter, particularly around specialty products where we have disproportionate market share.","Barbara A. Brungess","Tony, next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, in your prepared remarks, I think you spoke about the contribution from Walgreens. It has come in a little bit better than you expected. So can you just kind of like quantify for us, is this that Walgreen is sending you more business that they were holding back before? Or is Walgreen just growing faster?","Steven H. Collis","No, no, it's just -- it's purely their core growth rate. I mean, we essentially do all of their pharmaceutical distribution to their stores. And if you look at our customers, as the mutual fund of U.S. health care, we were merging that chain piece. And it's been very, very productive for us to have a large chain retailer and I have been with the combined company now for over 20 years, and we never ever had a big chain customer that was buying their store business for us. We had -- others we have, of course, within the various companies, but we've never had a big chain customer. I think that's been very, very helpful. It's helped with the capacity and scale issues that we have in our distribution centers. And we certainly are having to make more investments to keep up with the pace with our largest customer. And, of course, our PBM customer is a huge driver, around -- somewhere in the high teens, as well of our revenues. So our customers are doing well, and they're benefiting from health care reform and they're benefiting from utilization and innovation on the product side. So -- and that's especially evident at our larger customers, so.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up on the comment, Tim, that you made on the generic inflation. I think you said that brand inflation came up -- came in above your expectation. Generic came in a little bit below your expectation. So can just help us quantify that? Kind of like what are you seeing in terms of generic inflation? Obviously, that's been a big theme for the last year or so. Any thoughts of how to think about the going-forward contribution?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Ricky, I would say that on the brand side, again it was better than expected, and I would say, especially in the -- in our specialty business. And that is kind of tough to predict when and if it will come. So that helped to offset -- it's more than offset the -- a little bit generics being down. I don't think we want to get into trying to size that at this point, but we would -- we continue to see generic -- I don't think we've seen any changes. We continue to see generic inflation. And it's built into our guidance. I think we talked about we have a tough comp compared to last year. So I think that's probably the comments. I don't know, Steve, do you have anything to add?","Steven H. Collis","No.","Tim G. Guttman","No?","Steven H. Collis","No.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So from a guidance perspective, you really didn't make any changes to your guidance assumption. Is it true? Is it...","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, no, that's -- I'm glad you mentioned that. I mean, that's true. I mean, it was -- it's included in our guidance, and that's why we still have a $0.10 range in our guidance in case we -- in case generic inflation moderates the second half of the year, to some degree we would move further down in the range. So it's all factored in.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Ricky. Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just I guess on the guidance, obviously nice raise midway through the year. Now if I -- even after adjusting for what I think MWI will contribute from this point forward, clearly you're not calling for the items that drove the significant upside in 1Q and 2Q to continue in the back half. Slightly better back half than the previous guidance, but nothing to the order of magnitude that we've seen in the first half of the year. Just -- and I understand the headwinds that we knew about coming into the year that are in the back half. I guess I'm just curious if maybe you could talk a little bit more about what specifically is driving the amount of upside that we've have seen. And then I guess related to that, why isn't that expected to continue even relative to the headwinds we knew about coming in? Why isn't that expected to continue throughout the balance of the year?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I'll start. I mean, we called it out, but I'll gladly talk about it again. In the first half of the year, we've done really well in terms of just revenue growth and also, especially on the generic side, and brand price inflation. I would say that the second half, we're going to slow down in terms of generic revenues, especially in our largest customer. But we also anniversary their contribution from the procurement JV. And I think, Bob, one of the bigger things is just really DoD, the Department of Defense, contract. There was a significant reduction. It kicked in here in May, so it impacts us partly in 3 and more so in September quarter. And when we gave guidance originally at the beginning of the year, we always thought that generic Nexium would help buffer-zone that in the second half of the year and we just don't see that as a big recurring item.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that's changed, I guess, then from the original point of view on the back half?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, absolutely. With -- there hasn't been a #2 generic company -- manufacturer enter the market. We don't know when and if that will happen. Us being single source, the revenues are fine from that item, from the generics. But clearly, the margin, the economics just don't contribute that significantly.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. I guess just to follow up on the really impressive gross margin performance in the quarter, maybe can you give us a sense -- I know you've touched on this kind of across the board but maybe a little bit more specifically. Can you give us a sense of how much of the margin expansion came from within specialty? And if you're willing to go there, maybe what pieces of specialty are really helping push that margin higher?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I don't think we want to get into specifics between the core drug business and specialty. Again, I would say primarily drug. But clearly, specialty did well across the entire portfolio. All their businesses had a pretty good quarter, had good growth, and, as Steve mentioned, especially our ASD business.","Steven H. Collis","Yes, I mean, it's a -- we did all the business reviews. Honestly, all of our businesses did very well. It was across the board, really excellent performance. And we've made the capital deployments in high-margin areas, so we try to focus on the areas that kind of offset those larger customers that are growing at above the market. And we have 2 or 3 of them we've really talked about. But community oncology, we had a really good quarter, our best quarter we've had in a long time. That's a higher-margin segment for us because we have both the ION as well as the community oncology distribution business. So I was at an ION meeting last Friday and we had about 500 folks there. It was a very positive environment. The -- I think people have gotten used to the diminished reimbursements, and I think that the payers are being very constructive in their discussions. So the mix of business in the practices are good. And by that, I mean the mix between Medicare and private. And there are some good trends for them to partner with [ph] and take advantage of. And I think organizations like ION and Oncology Supply will be extremely helpful to the survival of community oncology in these tough times.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Bob. Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm going to go on a little bit of a fishing exercise right here. You guys detailed how generic dollar growth in the quarter was about 50%. Can you talk about what generic profit growth looked like and maybe some of the puts and takes around that?","Steven H. Collis","Tim, we had the...","Tim G. Guttman","No, I called out the 50% to give people an idea of not only the impressive growth in our Drug Company but also a good mix of our business. But I don't think we want to go -- George, I appreciate the question, but clearly generics are more profitable. But we're not going to get into that level of detail.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, fair enough. And then maybe, just as we think about tax rate on a go-forward basis, how should we think about how low the tax rate can go as the business shifts? And how much of that will be driven just by mix shift? And how much of that will be driven by kind of proactive strategies?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I would say, George, that good question, and the best word I can tell you is that tax rate is durable. So again, we called out it's not onetime items. We would expect it's a partial year. It's a partial year this year, so we will see some incremental benefits to our tax rate next year as we have a full year. And -- but that's probably it unless we change -- further change our mix of business or come up with some type of new initiative or idea.","Steven H. Collis","I mean, AmerisourceBergen Switzerland is a platform, and we -- I think it's helped coordinate with WBAD, but it's also a new interface mechanism, as I pointed out. I think we gave intensive comments on that. And there's a lot of innovation in that group. I just spent the weekend with them and was meeting with some of our key suppliers. So we do think there could be opportunity there to carry on doing more services abroad. BluePoint is a great driver for our business. It's been well received in the marketplace. So the mix of business, I think, is looking favorable in terms of our international businesses. And also, World Courier. If you look at corporate, World Courier is a good driver for us with above-market growth in its prospects. And I think we're starting to make some good progress there on really the -- looking at those ICS kind of orphan drug distribution opportunities. We bought a couple of new facilities that we've introduced, particularly in Asia. So I think, again, the investments we've made, the business emphasis, the people, it's quite an extraordinary time at AmerisourceBergen.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, George. Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of follow-up questions. Tim, can you give us any color on when the new renewal pricing will go into effect for the Express Scripts relationship? If I remember correctly, I thought that the contract ran through October of '15, but will that impact the next 2 quarters?","Tim G. Guttman","Let me -- Lisa, let me clarify that. The contract was really -- it was through September 30, '15. We just extended for a year under the same terms and conditions. So no impact whatsoever to our Q3, Q4 this year.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then see, Steven, when I look at the specialty business, I think you called out that you saw some shift from distribution to pharmacy. Can you just give us a little more color as to what's happening there and why you're seeing the shift from distribution to pharmacy? And then, can you just remind us if the margins are better when you see that shift?","Steven H. Collis","No. So there was a manufacturer-mandated program, and they still drop-ship [ph] programs that are peopled by drop -- by Drug Company essentially but coordinated through ASD Healthcare. So they are distribution contracts and they -- the economics are really comparable. These were manufacturers looking to use more of a specialty model with -- on the inventory side with a centralized location. So it's not going through a pharmacy program.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. But how do I think about the margin profile as we move forward if we see other incremental opportunities? And do you see incremental opportunities like this to work with the manufacturers in this regard?","Steven H. Collis","We try to be very consultative with the manufacturers. I think overall, the customers prefer it to come with their regular drug delivery. There are certain products -- I mean, you look at the legacy of ASD. Its product [ph], of course, with blood plasma products. We do a lot of work in flu vaccine as part of our ASD and Besse division. And there's now some specialty products where there's unique data requirements. So the manufacturers might have a REMS program or some area like that and they would like ASD-impacted products. Sometimes, it makes more sense to go through the specialty distribution as opposed to roll-down [ph] wholesale. But we try to be very consultative and thoughtful about both approaches and including taking the customer's perspective. But manufacturers have views on -- especially the larger manufacturers on how these products should be distributed throughout the supply chain. So we have all the tools, though, whatever the requirements are.","Barbara A. Brungess","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question on BluePoint. I know you mentioned you had your first injectable product this quarter. As you think about the strategy you've taken there, we've heard 2 different strategies of late, one within the U.S. market focused on very low-value products, another in the European market focused on partnering with manufacturers, how do you feel your BluePoint strategy fits among the spectrum?","Steven H. Collis","No, I don't know about lower value, but I think it's maturer products. And certainly with this, quite a few participants in the market. They had to be those sort of conditions prevalent for us to do a private label program. And it's really done in conjunction with the manufacturers. And I don't think it's vastly similar than the European model, but I'm not an expert on that. So it's not -- but I would say it's fairly similar circumstances in order to do a private label program, so.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I'm surprised given the commentary on tax. Do you feel that you're pretty early in BluePoint and that you have a pretty large expansion opportunity? I would think that would help drive the tax rate down over time beyond what you have today.","Tim G. Guttman","Well, again, that's one of the 3 components that I called out. It's grown and increased quickly over the last couple of years. If it continues to grow, it will help that mix. So I guess the short answer is, it could -- yes, it could help drive -- it could help influence our tax rate.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you feel you're still very early in BluePoint's development?","Tim G. Guttman","I think we still have some -- a ways to go. I mean, it's an area that we continue to focus on.","Steven H. Collis","Yes, and we got to partner with WBAD and the successive [ph] elements, so we think there's some opportunity there. And now that WBA is together, we really are starting to focus on that, and I think the AmerisourceBergen Swift Code -- Switzerland, I should say, is of course going to be very constructive for that.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Eric. We're coming up on noon here, so could we just have room for one more question, please?","Operator","That will come from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve and Tim, so really for me just a couple of quick ones on the back half comps. The DoD renewal announcement had occurred back in mid-November, but can remind us again when that pricing goes into effect? I think Lisa hit on the Express, so we're good on that one. But then the other thing for the back half would be a could we theoretically substitute generic Abilify launch for generic Nexium as a guidance component for the back half? Or do you not want to count that one yet just given that Abilify is an at-risk launch? So curious to get your thoughts on that one, too.","Tim G. Guttman","It's Tim. I'll start. The DoD will be -- will impact us 2 months in the June quarter, May and June, and it will impact us for the entire September quarter. So we'll have that. And again, as we talked about, there is a significant reduction to market, but it is to offset that and it's a long-term contract with a growing, very, very good customer. The generic -- your second question on generic Abilify, it's not in our guidance. We haven't contemplated -- it's too new. And that's, I guess, the easy way to say that's a TBD. We'll have to wait to see how that works in terms of uptake in the market and also the margin and how many ultimately come to market, manufacturers.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. Before we go, Steve would like to make some final comments.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Well, thank you, Barbara. And this -- we're now concluding one of the most memorable quarters in ABC's history. I've actually been very active this quarter throughout the ABC universe as we've had many customer and internal meetings. I'm tremendously proud of the engagement and passion of the ABC associates. That is true throughout our company, including our international assets, and we highlighted the third anniversary of our acquisition here in the clinical trial space. So we could not be more thrilled of our overall portfolio.","","Just want to give a special welcome to MWI, which is our largest acquisition to date, where we continue to be thrilled about the quality of the service, their customer base and the people that literally continue to delight us. So thank you for your attention and interest in ABC.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. I'd just like to highlight our upcoming conference activity before we go. We'll be attending the Deutsche Bank health care conference in Boston on May 6; the Bank of America health care Conference in Las Vegas on May 11; the UBS health care conference in New York on May 18; and the Goldman Sachs health care conference in Rancho Palos Verde on June 9.

At this time, all phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given to you at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over to your opening speaker for today, Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results. I'm Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen; and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today's call, we also will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in today's press release as well as on our website.","During this conference call, we will also make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, EPS, operating margin and income taxes.","Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone. Today, I am pleased to discuss our first quarter results as well as AmerisourceBergen's continued execution, the stability we're seeing in the marketplace and our company's strong positioning for long-term growth and shareholder value creation.","Revenues were up 6% to $40.5 billion for the quarter, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.55 for the first quarter, an increase of 14% compared to the previous fiscal year period.","Importantly, our core Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses are executing extremely well, growing volumes with key customers and segments, and continue to effectively manage operating expenses. We're very pleased with the strong start for the fiscal year.","We are proud of this continued solid execution, and I want to take a moment to again thank our amazing team of 21,000 associates, including those that have recently joined us through the acquisition of H. D. Smith for their dedication and performance.","As I have said before, it is our associates around the globe, who help shape our culture, power our corporate transformation and drive our growth. So again, thank you.","With one quarter completed in fiscal year 2018, we believe that our consistent ability to execute and achieve more will continue to drive growth and create value in the healthcare market and for our shareholders.","My comments today will be focused on three topics: one, AmerisourceBergen's proven continued execution; two, the current market landscape; and three, our strong positioning for long-term growth.","So first, execution. I continue to be extremely proud about how AmerisourceBergen is successfully navigating the healthcare markets. We are growing our revenue and our gross profit with a diverse portfolio of fast-growing customers. We're successfully servicing the new business and volume from AllianceRx and Rite Aid.","Walgreens has now acquired more than 600 Rite Aid stores, and has said that they'll continue at an increasing pace moving forward. We were fully prepared and are seamlessly adding these stores into our distribution network.","Following on the close of our acquisition in January, we are also integrating new H. D. Smith customers. As we said at the time of the deal announcement, we're very proud to bring H. D. Smith, which was the largest independent wholesaler in the U.S., into the AmerisourceBergen family. It's a best-in-class operation with a diversified customer base and the strategic cultural fit with our own business is very strong.","Importantly, we're also continuing to make great progress increasing the purchasing compliance across our existing customer base. This strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth and helping us to offset what has been higher than historic deflation rates. We also have continued to execute across specialty distribution, oncology and physician-administered product distribution, where AmerisourceBergen has long been the leader.","In the first quarter, we marked our 16th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth for this part of our business. I really believe that innovation is a hallmark of AmerisourceBergen. In the first quarter alone, we supported the launch of virtually all of the new specialty products, and we also convened more than 150 community oncology providers and patient support teams to explore the future of immuno-oncology with our ION Solutions group.","Of course, execution is also about successfully navigating through challenges. We are committed to enhancing PharMEDium's quality assurance and quality control programs and continuing to build its position as the industry's market and quality leader. That includes remediation efforts currently underway at our Memphis facility, where we voluntarily suspended operations in December.","We are working diligently and communicating with the FDA to fully comply with the Agency's 503B regulations and new compounding policy barrings. There will be an impact to our fiscal year 2018 financial expectations for the business, which Tim will talk about in more detail in a few minutes, but this business and its offering is strong and we feel we are best positioned to execute over the long-term, meeting and growing market demand and delivering the highest quality products to our customers.","In our Other segment, Commercialization Services and Animal Health, market leader MWI continues to grow revenue driven primarily by strong U.S. companion animal market. I just returned from a meeting of our MWI sales associates, and I must say that I've been consistently impressed with their knowledge and passion for the business and the customers they serve. MWI has established itself not only as the market leader, but as a valuable demand-creating extension of our manufacturer partners' businesses.","World Courier also had a very strong first quarter, its position as the leader in global specialty logistics services drove compelling volume growth and overall performance. We are especially proud of its recent designation as the first logistics company to obtain global Good Distribution Practices, or GDP, certification against three major GDP standards and the only provider to hold a GDP certification with such wide and global scope.","As we're continuing to execute at Lash Consulting launching the Fusion platform, which is a game-changer for the industry, the customer migration and onboarding progress has been in its early stages, which is having an impact on the segment, but we are confident that we have the right teams, technology and an unrivaled expertise to make this an important growth driver for our company over the long-term.","Second, let's talk about the stability of the current market. Overall, we're continuing to see a stable market and competitive market. Generic buy-side deflation has been higher than historic norms for several quarters, creating a headwind for us and our business. That deflation rate, however, has been stable. We continue to see it tracking in the high-single digits in Q1, in line with our expectations.","Brand inflation is also tracking in line with our projections. We have no major contract renewals on the horizon and we are making strong progress on our customer contract rebalancing efforts. All of these factors are drivers of the market and competitive stability we're currently seeing across our industry.","Finally, third, AmerisourceBergen is strongly positioned for long-term growth. As Tim will talk about in a few more minutes, there are significant benefits for AmerisourceBergen as a result of recent tax reform. As a U.S. tax payer with primary U.S. income, the new tax rate enhances our ability to invest in our business, to innovate and to deliver value to our shareholders. Over the long-term, this enables AmerisourceBergen to grow our U.S. business.","In the last two years alone, we've continued our commitment to improving and enhancing our business, investing nearly $1 billion in capital spend to create operational efficiencies, leverage scale and provide best-in-class customer service. We are well-positioned to realize long-term benefits from our state-of-the-art services, distribution network and IT investments.","AmerisourceBergen's innovative platform also differentiates us in the healthcare industry and we continue to build our portfolio of high value services and integrate them into our customers' businesses.","For example, we've been able to show that community pharmacy customers (10:42) full line of services and solutions grow faster than their peers and more growth and success for our customers, ultimately means more growth and success for AmerisourceBergen.","I'm happy to report that our highly automated distribution network, now includes six of our planned seven new distribution centers and we are confident that our capacity and capabilities are industry leading.","We've also made \u2013 are industry leading. We've also made strategic investments in our IT systems, positioning AmerisourceBergen to realize greater operational efficiency and increased operating leverage.","As we've discussed on past earnings calls, in 2017 and 2018, we are rolling out eight new IT systems, including ABC Order, for the Pharmaceutical Distribution business, key systems at (11:37) and World Courier, and new e-commerce platform at MWI and Fusion at Lash, these systems enable us to better run our day-to-day business and, importantly, to quickly and efficiently service our customers and their patients.","Another driver for long-term growth in AmerisourceBergen is our established, undisputed leadership in specialty. We continue to offer one of the industry's broadest ranges of clinical trial support, consulting commercialization services, data analytics and specialty product distribution, with specialty product outpacing the broader pharmaceutical market, which is definitely a growth opportunity for AmerisourceBergen.","Another opportunity for future growth is in biosimilars. With several biosimilars and follow-on biologics now approved by the FDA, we're advancing towards a marketplace where those products have a greater impact on patient care.","AmerisourceBergen has always had a strategic approach to biosimilars recognizing them as a distinct product launch that they are and we feel our market position, particularly our market leadership in specialty and community oncology is a differentiator for us.","Our diverse, fast growing portfolio of customers also strongly positions AmerisourceBergen for long-term growth with Walgreens, Express Scripts, Kaiser, CPA and so many others, we have both integrated strategic partnerships that support and accelerate expansion. Driven by customers' performance and leadership in the fast-growing specialty market, AmerisourceBergen expects to outpace the U.S. pharmaceutical market growth range over the next five years. We're extremely proud of our customers and the services and value we deliver to them every day.","Finally, at AmerisourceBergen we have the talent and the team in place to maximize and realize all of these opportunities. I'm so proud of the strength of our team and how AmerisourceBergen continues to internally develop and elevate our leaders. They are leading, executing and delivering great results.","In summary, AmerisourceBergen is strong. We are evolving and transforming our business to best meet the needs of our customers, drive value for our shareholders and ultimately serve patients. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.","Now let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results and our financial guidance update for fiscal 2018.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. And growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter unless otherwise noted.","For a discussion of our GAAP results, including one-time adjustments related to tax reform, I'd ask that you please refer to our earnings release.","As Steve mentioned, we had a solid quarter and our focus continues to be on executing across our businesses. Overall, we finished better than we expected, driven by execution in several of our priority areas, despite a couple of headwinds. Our commitment as we move forward is to always deliver outstanding service, solutions and value to our customers.","This morning, I'll provide commentary in two main areas. First, I will highlight our quarterly consolidated and segment performance. And the second area, I will cover our revised fiscal 2018 expectations, including impacts from tax reform and PharMEDium.","Let's begin with our Q1 2018 results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.55, an increase of 14%. This included $0.15 from the benefit of the new U.S. tax legislation. I will provide more color on the impact from tax reform shortly.","Our consolidated revenues were $40.5 billion, up a solid 6%. Operating income \u2013 our adjusted operating income was $488 million, up $2 million with our operating margin down 6 basis points.","As expected, and as we have previously communicated, we had a much higher growth rate in our operating expenses due to costs associated with new distribution centers, duplicate IT costs resulting from the implementation of new systems and variable costs supporting our higher revenues.","Given the timing of the onboarding of the Walgreens new store business, we expect disproportionate relationships between gross profit contribution and operating expense to continue at least for the next quarter.","Moving below the operating income line. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 24.2% and reflects primarily the positive impact from tax reform and the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.","Our annualized effective tax rate is based on a blended calculation using the previous corporate federal tax rate for one quarter and the new 21% tax rate for three quarters applied against our U.S. pre-tax income.","For fiscal year 2018, the impact of tax reform will contribute about $0.60 to our adjusted EPS. During the December quarter, we also had a slightly lower tax rate than expected due to ongoing tax initiatives.","Our adjusted net income increased about 13% to $342 million, as a result of our lower tax expense. Our diluted share count decreased slightly to 221 million shares. In the December quarter, we repurchased a modest amount of shares; given our announced H. D. Smith acquisition and our subsequent bond offering. We exited the quarter with $766 million remaining on our current board share repurchase authorization.","Moving over to cash flow and our cash balance. In the December quarter, we are off to a good start, given that we had a very slight negative free cash flow of about $60 million, which is better than we expected.","This year, we had the benefit from sales mix and also continued efforts in managing our working capital, including our inventory levels and churns. Last year, we were still making a working capital investment with our largest customer.","We ended the quarter with roughly $3 billion in cash, which includes the proceeds from our November debt issuance. However, it's worth noting that in January, we used cash to fund and close our acquisition of H. D. Smith. Of our total cash balance at December quarter-end, we had about $1.1 billion offshore and a majority of this amount was U.S. denominated cash. This finishes the review of our consolidated results.","Next let me switch and cover our segment results. And we can begin with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Total segment revenues were $38.9 billion, up nearly 6%. The segment continues to benefit from the growth of our largest customer, Walgreens, which includes incremental specialty drug sales to AllianceRx. We started servicing AllianceRx in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, so we haven't yet anniversaried this new business.","During the quarter, we also had very good revenue growth across our existing customers in the independent retail segment. Our inside sales team is increasingly serving as a resource for our independent customers, focusing on their products and service needs, while helping to ensure customers are optimizing their contracts by reaching and exceeding their generics compliance rates. This creates a win-win for our customers and our business.","Let me highlight year-over-year, we are extremely pleased with the overall decrease in our generic leakage percentage, down roughly 400 basis points.","Moving over to specialty distribution, defined as our oncology and physician-administered specialty drugs and consistent with our previous reporting of legacy ABSG, we saw revenues increased 12%. Volume trends continue to be very good, especially in oncology, led by new innovative drugs, and also ophthalmology and MS.","Wrapping up this segment, we did have revenue headwind of about 100 basis points, from lower Hepatitis C revenues again this quarter. Segment operating income increased about 2% to $388 million. This segment benefited from solid revenue growth, notably from specialty products.","Additionally, we realized the benefits from driving higher-than-expected PRxO Generic revenues. We were pleased with the contribution from PRxO and our overall margins during the quarter.","The segment's first quarter results and year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, where we had lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. PharMEDium's 503B outsourcing facilities were inspected by the FDA, beginning in late calendar 2017 and carrying into early 2018. As a result of these inspections, we voluntarily suspended operations at our Memphis facility.","Memphis is our largest 503B production facility and our most highly automated one. We are engaging an ongoing dialog with the FDA to implement any corrective actions that should be taken and to confirm a clear pathway to full compliance for this facility.","We were previously optimistic that Memphis operations would restart in early January. However, the facility remains closed, and we currently anticipate that operations will resume this quarter. We fully expect to ramp production through the second half of the fiscal year and exit the year at full production.","It's important to note that all of the other PharMEDium inspections are now complete, and our other three 503B facilities have remained operational throughout this process. Because of the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than anticipated.","As Steve mentioned, we are committed to continuing to build PharMEDium's position as the industry's market and quality leader. PharMEDium's business fundamentals remain strong and unchanged. There is certainly high demand for outsourced compounded sterile preparations.","Additionally, we believe that FDA's new 2018 guidance will provide further clarity and increase oversight around its 503B standards. We believe this will be another positive for our business and create new opportunities.","Overall, we remain confident that we'll cycle through this remediation period, and ultimately, we will increase PharMEDium's competitive advantage while delivering the highest quality compounded sterile preparations available today.","We can now move to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health and include World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI.","In the quarter, total revenues were $1.5 billion, up 12%. All three businesses contributed to the revenue growth. World Courier had an excellent quarter, with records in both shipment and billable weight.","MWI had revenue growth as a percentage in the low-teens, driven mostly by Alliance shipped that increased in the high-teens. On a comparable basis, we had a 10% growth rate in companion animal revenues. MWI is benefiting from a growing U.S. market, but they also continue to gain incremental share. From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $100 million, down about 6%, or $7 million.","As I just highlighted, World Courier had strong operating income growth, as a result of the businesses increased in revenues and mix of business. However, the segment did have lower contributions from both MWI and Consulting.","MWI had a tough comparable to last year, when they earned certain manufacturer rebates based on established revenue targets. These rebates do not repeat in the December 2017 quarter. Additionally, MWI had higher operating costs, primarily associated with a higher number of shipments and revenues. That said, MWI's operating income growth rate is expected to improve going forward, and we are confident they will meet their full-year contribution target.","Finally, our Consulting business was down year-over-year, due primarily to the implementation of Fusion and the cadence for Lash's new business development pipeline.","During the quarter, we made progress converting and supporting manufacturer clients on this new technology platform. However, the conversion process is slower than we previously anticipated, which slows down Lash's ability to onboard new business.","We are excited by the feedback we are receiving on Fusion so far. And despite, the slower-than-anticipated ramp, we remain confident that this new platform will be best-in-class, a unique asset and a long-term value driver.","Now let's turn to our revised full-year fiscal 2018 expectations. Consolidated revenues, we continue to expect growth between 8% and 11%. This growth rate includes the onboarding of the Walgreens' Rite Aid stores, which will accelerate into our third fiscal quarter. The growth rate also includes nine months of revenue contribution from the new H. D. Smith business.","Consolidated operating expenses. We are now able to formally adjust for the addition of the H. D. Smith business. As a result, we expect our OpEx growth rate will be between 6% and 8%. Let me emphasize, backing out the incremental OpEx impact from H. D. Smith, we will be right in line with our previous OpEx guidance.","Consolidated adjusted operating income. We now expect to grow between 1% and 4%. Importantly, without the impact of PharMEDium, our operating income guidance range would have remained unchanged.","Let me cover the revised guidance from a segment standpoint. We expect the following: Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, growth of 1% to 4%, reduced to reflect the impact from PharMEDium. Again, we believe these regulatory initiatives are near-term challenges for the business. We have the right people and resources mobilized to address these items. We are confident that PharMEDium will remain a trusted partner to our customers for their outsourced compounding needs, and a compelling long-term growth driver for ABC.","On an overall basis, excluding PharMEDium, this segment is executing well. Core fundamentals are strong. Volumes, generic compliance rates, customer renewal sell-side rates and margins are all performing as expected or even better than we anticipated.","Moving on, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health. We now expect operating income growth to be between flat and up 2%. Compared to prior guidance, this is a decrease, due in large part to our Fusion technology transformation that I just discussed at our Lash Consulting business.","Moving below the operating income line. Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of 23% to 24%, primarily lower to reflect the ongoing benefit from U.S. tax reform. We also expect a slightly better than anticipated contribution from the accounting for share-based compensation, and also from continued tax initiatives.","Looking forward; so for fiscal 2019, at this point, we expect to see a further decrease in our effective tax rate of 150 basis points to 200 basis points due to the net full-year impact of tax reform.","Interest expense. Although, we did not guide specifically on interest expense, when we provided our initial fiscal 2018 guidance, since we issued debt in connection with our H. D. Smith acquisition, it's important to highlight that we will have about a 25% increase in our quarterly interest expense beginning in Q2 2018.","Share repurchases. We continue to guide to modest share buybacks generally enough to offset the dilutive impact from employee stock-option exercises.","Adjusted EPS. Our fiscal 2018 range will now be $6.45 to $6.65. This revised range includes the estimated positive impact from tax reform of $0.60, offset primarily by the change in our expectations for PharMEDium.","Switching to our free cash flow. Our new range which continues to exclude non-recurring items is $1.35 billion to $1.6 billion, and reflects the positive impact from our cash tax savings, as a result of tax reform.","Overall, we are pleased with tax reform, not only the lower effective tax rate, but also preserving the LIFO tax deduction. The benefit from this deduction allows companies like ABC to continually invest in infrastructure, drive scale efficiency and also to carry higher levels of inventory. All of these enable us to better serve our customers.","In closing, this continues to be a dynamic time in healthcare and because of this, AmerisourceBergen is evolving and transforming our business.","At the same time, our principles remain strongly in place, financially disciplined and highly focused on execution. Doing what we do well and doing it consistently, so that our customers can advance their businesses. We're confident that this is a winning formula, and it enables ABC to be the partner of choice, which keeps us on the path of creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here is Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Tim. Operator, we're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Glen Santangelo of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Tim, I just want to follow-up with some comments you made with respect to the guidance. I think you said that the operating profit growth goal was 4% to 7%, and that was sort of post the H. D. Smith acquisition. Now it's 1% to 4%. So, you decreased the guidance by about 3% off the midpoint, and just looking at your operating profit, totals for the year, it looks like to be about a $60 million hit to your guidance. And I think you said that absent PharMEDium, you would not have changed that guidance. So, are we correct in assuming that PharMEDium is about a $60 million drag on your operating profit numbers this year?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hi Glen. Good morning. Yeah. I would say that you're thinking about it correctly. I mean, we were transparent, we gave our new revised guidance. PharMEDium is \u2013 when we purchased PharMEDium high-margin, high-growth, very profitable. So, I would say, as you think about the change in guidance and that midpoint, think about the core business performing really well, probably better than we expected, all the trends that we called out. So positive from the core business, offset almost all by PharMEDium and a little bit of Lash. So that's \u2013 yeah, directionally you're thinking about it right. Please don't forget about the core performing very well.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That was going to be my follow-up question. Steve, you sort of went into it and you talked a little bit about some of the issues in MWI and Lash, maybe being a little bit weaker than expected within this fiscal year. And it kind of sounds like the weakness might be offset within the range of the guidance, or as Tim just sort of pointed out, maybe the core Pharmaceutical Distribution business maybe doing a little bit better than expected. So, could you just sort of weigh-in on that a little bit?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I think on the core business, we carry on hitting on very well on specialty with another record revenue quarters and market leadership there, and new products coming out. I think we've done very well with launches and participate in our Commercialization Services.","As you noted, we did have a tough quarter in MWI but that was more from a comp perspective and not out of the historical norm. And Mark Shaw and Jim Frary and the team, they are working hard to make their numbers for the year and we've got every confidence they will.","And I just would say that we had good trends in utilization. Our portfolio of customers is excellent, as you know, all growing very well. And we're benefiting a bit from mix, so although we still see higher than anticipated generic deflation rates. There are lot of other offsetting trends, including specialty, better compliance and some of the rebalancing that we've done, which is a long-term process, but definitely we're seeing that it has benefited us. That discipline that we've observed about two or three years ago is really benefiting as that top line changes even quicker than we expected it would because of deflation in generics.","And then brand inflation trends were pretty much as expected, maybe slightly higher than expected. So overall, we liked the quarter a lot. We just got control of all issues around our own performance with two businesses that we're working very hard on.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the details.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks so much. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to go back to PharMEDium. I believe there are four PharMEDium facility locations and I know you said that the others were up and running; but is there any FDA concerns or focus around this particular issue at the other facilities?","And then just trying to put some numbers around the PharMEDium issue. Tim, could you give us just a sense of what percent of total PharMEDium production comes from Memphis? I know you said it was the highest and most automated facility, but just trying to get a little bit more specific of a gauge of how big that is relative to total PharMEDium?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Bob, Good morning. Yeah, let me emphasis that there are four facilities. Three, the other three, have their inspections completed, all are operational; and again that's a positive.","Memphis is our largest facility. They're roughly, ballpark, maybe half of our production capacity. They're highly automated. They're some robotics and some automation equipment there. So, they're not only large, but they're very efficient. We're confident, we're mobilized, we're on Memphis. We anticipate it's going to be open this quarter. There will be a glide path to get production back up.","And as Steve mentioned, it's manageable, controllable, there's tremendous demand from customers. The positive is a lot of the production that we \u2013 if we put a customer on quota it shifted back to the hospital, we feel confident that we can regain and get that share back in a reasonable amount of time. So, again, a little bit slower than we anticipated this year, but a positive that we exit the year and get into next year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on tax. I just want to make sure I understand the impact from tax reform on the quarter and the full-year. So, I think you're excluding a benefit from reduced tax liabilities in the quarter. That sounds like it was a result of tax reform, but yet the tax rate on an adjusted basis for 1Q was obviously quite a bit lower than what was expected at around 24%. So, I guess, what drove the lower rate?","And then for the guidance, that $0.60 that you're talking about being a benefit for the full-year, does that include any portion of the lower rate that we saw in 1Q or is that all incremental starting January 1?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, Bob, let me \u2013 let me \u2013 the $0.60 is all tax reform. I mean, that's our estimate of the change in the statutory rate for three quarters over our annualized U.S. income, again, but we also had a benefit in our tax rate just from different initiatives and, again, with our share price up a little bit higher previously, we saw some stock comps. So clearly the $0.60 is all tax reform, but we continue to work hard to be very thoughtful and plan for our tax rate. Hopefully that answers your question.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Bob.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I'm sorry to keep jumping back to PharMEDium here, but as we expect the ramp and the facility to get back online, and you expect that to ramp up. Is there any reason not to think that we would recover the EBIT contribution from the Memphis facility? Or is there anything in sort of remediation that would change sort of what the output of that facility would be?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Essentially, it should get back. It's timing. We have to ramp production up, build up inventory, get the inventories released, get customers back in the ordering cycling. So, if we are correct that we get back \u2013 that we get the facilities inspected and released this quarter, then we should see some impact the next quarter. Hopefully, we aimed fiscal year 2018 as the full run rate that we would expect, at least from revenue. Some slightly more operating expenses, but nothing serious; maybe 1% or 2% for a higher-margin business than \u2013 almost than any other business we have, so.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the OpEx side, obviously, that ticked up again. Can you remind me \u2013 I'm sorry, I might have missed exactly what that was attributed to. And \u2013 should we think of this as \u2013 is this sort of a near-term phenomenon? And then should we expect that also to maybe normalize again later on? Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. OpEx, we did change our guidance on OpEx. It increased and again, that's because of closing H. D. Smith and having that business for nine months. But again, in the prepared comments, we were very specific; ex H. D. Smith, excluding that, we would have been right in line with our OpEx that we gave originally.","And then I think the OpEx \u2013 the important thing really on OpEx is we're going to create some value in 2019. The OpEx is high; there's a little bit of a mismatch as we take on all the business for the full-year. As we eliminate some of the duplication in the system, down the road, there's going to be value created on OpEx and better leverage. So again, getting into 2019, OpEx will certainly be a tailwind as that comes in line with where we expect it to be.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. But the \u2013 the H. D. Smith was included in the original OpEx guidance, too, wasn't it, so?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, it was not. When we gave original guidance at the end of the year, at the end of Q4, that was not contemplated and we never adjusted it when we announced H. D. Smith.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great to clarify. Thank you.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Caliendo of Needham. Please go ahead.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Kevin, are you there? You may be on mute.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","I apologize. I was on mute. I apologize. Thanks for taking my call. Can you talk to what PharMEDium did from an EBIT perspective in fiscal 2017? Just so we have some scope of sort of how big this business is for you?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Kevin, it's Tim. Yeah, I don't think we want to size PharMEDium. I mean they're a terrific business, high margin. Like we said, demand is very strong. They're off to a good start this year. Our October-November, we were off to a really good start, so I don't think we want to call it out.","And again, I mean without the impact from PharMEDium this year, we would've been right in line with op income, where we thought we would be. But again, I think PharMEDium we talked about it and we did the acquisition. We pay that healthy multiple because of the growth and what \u2013 and being a market leader and best-in-class, but I think that's as far as we want to go.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","No, that's fine. I appreciate that. Can we just talk a little bit about the Rite Aid onboarding? Obviously, it's in your guidance, but can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 I'm assuming that the Rite Aid stores will have a little bit lower margin than your corporate average. I'm guessing it will be the same as what you get from Walgreens. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I mean we have, as we said, about 600 pharmacies that we really have onboard and we expect to be complete by the late spring. So quarter four will be the first quarter that we have the full run rate benefit. And sure, it's part of \u2013 (42:39) Walgreens (42:38) essentially. So yeah, you could expect it would be slightly lower. But it's still manageable.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah. No, I just wanted to make sure we were thinking about the right way.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","And just late \u2013 oh, I'm sorry.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, that's okay.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Just really quick on H. D. Smith. Very good reputation business. Can you talk a little bit about how it would be integrated into Good Neighbor Pharmacy product? And if there's anything strategically you do with it, how you operate within the independents or the GPOs. Is there anything you can take from them? Or is it going to be fully integrated sort of into your business?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We just had our first sales integration review last week. Again, confirms that there's a really good cultural fit between the two businesses, they have competed surprisingly well against the Big 3 in an independent sectors. I would say we've seen some best practices in areas like long-term care, so \u2013 where we probably lagged a little bit maybe since we lost PharMerica. I think with PharMerica coming back into WBAD, we could really think about that sector and gain some reasonable market share there. We've retained \u2013 we're not going very fast, Jeff (sic) [Kevin].","I think that the team wants to be cautious. It's highly prized customer subset and certainly there are customers that were anxious to receive some of the benefits of elevating Good Neighbor Pharmacy and we try to transition those on an expedited basis. But we've kept all the sales force essentially, so far in our distribution centers have been cut down and we're looking at it very closely.","We've just with the Rite Aid onboarding and that, we decided to just slow again. We have the room to do that. So \u2013 and we've had some key executives (44:40) who decided to stay with us and are looking to have their career with AmerisourceBergen. And we've done very well with executives from acquired companies that have assumed senior roles at ABC and contribute a lot. So, so far we're very happy with it. It's going well.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much, and thanks for all the disclosure.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Thanks. In MWI, you need to lower rebates, is that a function of a, I guess, less favorable contract being negotiated contracts with a consolidated vendor base? Or is this a change in agency versus buy-sell relationships? And, I guess, how will that impact or inflate top line versus the margin trend for that business? Or are there any other changes or major changes in contracts in terms of that business going forward? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. You could say with MWI, I think, I've got everything. There had been some shifting manufactured dynamics of the Boehringer Ingelheim acquisition of Sanofi, so that changed some things. I think you've had some manufacturers with some competitive overlaps, where there was some different pricing rebate issues.","And we had a very \u2013 I wouldn't say we had a bad quarter loss in 2017. It was just really a very good fourth quarter in 2016, exceptionally good. Maybe more one-time items you could take them in the fourth quarter. So yes, it's something that we were a little bit behind expectations on.","But quite a good plan and the business, the units that they're shipping are very good. The market share is good. We did a small little acquisition there, which was very important to the East Coast sales force and the East Coast customer base. So, I was at the sales meeting, and we're looking at what we could do better on expense control. And so, we're confident that MWI will hit their numbers and we've always given them a great target, so (46:48). When we say that we think they're going to hit their numbers for this year that there will be good performance year-over-year.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Great. Thanks, Erin.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So...","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, can we move to the next question? Sorry, I know we're closing in on only about ten minutes left in the call.","Operator","George Hill, RBC.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe switch gears a little bit and talk about Lash. You talked about the onboarding issues. I guess, is there any customer churn risk here? Can we talk about how many \u2013 or I guess can you guys talk about how many people have been on-boarded? And kind of how do we think about risk to the business as it relates to re-platforming?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, we did. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. We did have some customers that got a bit maybe frustrated about the delay or particularly price concerns, but not too many. We've on-boarded about three or four customers, I'd say. They're happy with the results. We just have renewed two new customers \u2013 well one new customer and renewed a big one. So, we've got solid leadership there, and it's a big project. If we had our (48:00), we probably would have started earlier. But, we're working with the facts we have and it's a great business for us.","I've had that business reporting to me since 1998 and this is the second year they've had budgetary issues. So, it's, overall, been very stable, very good at managing targets, very good at managing programs. We were in a busy time of the year there right now with the re-verification processes. So, we've got every bit of confidence that it fulfills a great need in manufacturers and there's also some interesting opportunities to do that sort of work, maybe more for providers, so I think we got lots of interesting strategic opportunities, so we're bullish on Lash, we think it's one of our most important franchise platform businesses.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Great. Thanks, Steve.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Just one clarification and then one question. On the clarification, when we think about PharMEDium and the Memphis facility and talking about it getting back up online, the way that I understand what you're saying is that the roughly $60 million impact is going to be for the rest of the year, even though things will start to come online, it wasn't specific to the quarter. Number one, do I understand that correctly?","And then, secondly, I just want to understand, Steve or Tim, how you think about the impact of flu on your business as we think about how rampant it's been here in the first quarter.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Lisa. No. Thanks. I think it's an important question to clarify. Most of that, as you think about PharMEDium in terms of cadence for the year, I mean, we did have a couple penny impact in Q1 from lower production in December. Most of that change will be in the March quarter. I think, I mentioned there's a glide path, I mean, so most of the impact will be Q2. There will be a small impact again in Q3 as we kind of glide back to full production. And then, Q4 less of an impact and really no impact, because we're back to full production. So, as you think about the cadence, that's the right way of thinking about it.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","And then, flu.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Flu. I mean, I think flu I saw some early numbers the other day, slight impact in December quarter, but, certainly, as we saw the numbers in January and really picked up in January in terms of revenues. And so far we haven't had any type of issues in terms of fulfillment or being short product; we're staying pretty current with what we're shipping out to our customers, but flu looks to be fairly strong from a revenue standpoint in January.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Question from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I have a question about biosimilar contracting and you mentioned given that the biosimilar market there have been some products out for a little bit of time now. What changes are you seeing? And how are manufacturers reacting to your contracting them separately from other specialty products? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Okay. Just repeat the last part of that question, contracting with...","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Sure. Yeah. Just in terms of how you're contracting, the discussions are going with manufacturers, or separately from other specialty products?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. We've talked about differentiated pricing. Certainly, as we think about biosimilars, that's a unique class of how we're contracting with a unique price and making sure we get appropriate compensation. So that's an area as we re-contract with customers, that has a specific price and margin and that's how we're going \u2013 that's how we're approaching the market.","Again, Steve mentioned in his prepared comments, the rebalancing is really critical. It's going to help us offset lower contribution from generics and the headwind from generic deflation, but we want to make sure we get appropriate pricing on biosimilars, on specialty, on core brand, on generics. That's a big emphasis of the company and we're making good progress.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. And most of the margin has to come from buy-side, so services that we provide and the most robust portfolio of services we have is in oncology and specialty area. It's possible we could have some in U.S. bio, which is a business we're starting to highlight more, we've been very successful in oral oncology, but there's definitely going to be more and more products.","I think it depends on how many products (52:54) changeability. It depends on who the manufacturer is. Some manufacturers are used to buying more services from us. So, we're trying to educate the market more and I think everyone understands that ABC has some unique capabilities to bring biosimilars to market and establish market share. We understand reimbursement really well.","And I think you've seen \u2013 I was just at an oncology meeting we had at end of last week, and definitely a very interested and enthusiastic group in terms of having more choices for their patients. So, we're bullish about biosimilars in the long-term. We just would like to see more legislative clarity and flexibility and acceleration. I think acceleration is the keyword. It's probably the number one opportunity is for cost efficiency in the system.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Great. Thanks. Operator, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question will come from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. And the Goldwasser line is open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick clarifications. So, Tim, just to clarify on fiscal year 2018 guidance, I thought that on November 20 you actually did up the EBIT guidance to include H. D. Smith. I think the 4% to 7% of Pharma EBIT growth included contributions. I guess, the question is, is what you're seeing in PharMEDium, has there been any \u2013 sorry, sorry, not PharMEDium \u2013 in H. D. Smith, has there been any changes to the fundamentals in the business? Or is it just that the integration might be taking a little bit slower?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Ricky. It's Tim. Yeah. We did update the guidance to include H. D. Smith. It was only the op income guidance but there have been no changes in H. D. Smith. We're still very pleased with H. D. Smith integrating. We've talked about this would be steady-state integrate, keep the customer experience, work on synergy 2019 and 2020, but so far as Steve mentioned, H. D. Smith is going really well, kept all the customers, no retention issues. The change in op income clearly on the new guidance and lowering it unfortunately is PharMEDium which is we believe manageable and contained and we're focused on it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then secondly, just as we think about the signposts to watch for PharMEDium and what's factored into guidance, so does the new guidance assume that the facility is going to reopen at the end of the quarter or when we think about the high to low end of the guidance range, is there also some assumption there that things might take longer to play out?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I'll start and Steve can jump in. The new guidance we did our best estimate, we put a lot of time and thought into it and talk to our business, and again our estimate assumes that they're going to be open during the quarter.","And again, we know this is important and we'll update the investor community if that changes but that's our best estimate today that based on, yes, what we know behind the remediation and progress that'll be open during the quarter.","I would say certainly the guidance as you think about the guidance, there are a lot of positive trends in the business, to the core business. So, the volumes turn out to be better. Reps are better. Generic compliance were chugging along. We're a little bit better on OpEx. We'll move up on the high end of the range. Certainly, we're optimistic and hopeful that we always are better than the guidance and that's what we're working for.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Okay. Operator, I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mr. David Larsen of Leerink. Please go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you just talk briefly about brand inflation and generic pricing? With the 7% to 9% generic deflation, what in your mind is a normal range for the buy-side? Is it like minus 3% or so? And then can you touch on the sell-side environment? Like, how is your spread trending between the buy and sell-side? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Again, the generic deflation that was all higher than the norm. We didn't have inflation for very long but we did \u2013 we were having one or two years where it was net or even slight positive with inflation and that was very helpful to the mix of business. So we've seen now stubbornly persistent high single digits sort of deflation rate. I think there are signs that it's going to turn with product rationalization, at least announced from the bigger players, so we will see how that turns. But so far, we haven't seen anything that would change our guidance, and we're more at the higher range of the range.","On brand, we were encouraged in light of increases in the high-single digits, and so what we expected, maybe a slightly stronger trend than we expected. But I think that we would never expect anything more than that. That's a rate that (58:33) sustainable, and of course we see these increases at the growth level, at the net level, (58:43) and depending on the category and the competition and the product maturity. But that is definitely at the gross level, and that's just how we play. So we see that playing out for a while, but we're managing with it.","Your other question was on the competitive environment. We're lucky we haven't really had a lot of big RFPs out this year. We went through a stage where we had a lot. We managed through those. I don't think we lost a big one other than where there was a cut from consolidation which everyone goes through.","So the market's pretty stable, and I think we all have very similar economics and all of these came from the successful public company, so there's some natural gates there. And again, the customers have to be pretty motivated to want to leave us, because AmerisourceBergen does a great job. We're very integrated with the customers, and we try like hell to keep them and enhance the level of services and do a good job for them. So they're usually not motivated to leave. But I think, Keri, you want to do one more question.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I think we have time for one more, operator.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just to follow-up on that last question, so as we think about the negative 7% to negative 9% generic pricing comment. So, does that essentially mean flattening of the generic pricing levels at the current level today? And then how do you view that translating into margins, obviously excluding the drag from PharMEDium and H. D. Smith?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, the 7% to 9%, we try to make that up by the unit sales and better compliance from customers, which I'd say in the last few years we've done very, very well on. Occasionally we have an opportunity to make more margin on the buy-side on a generic which could offset some of the inflation. So a product that's deflated say 10%, we manage to retain a bit more of the gross profit dollars, but it depends on reimbursement and the market.","And of course there's been a lot of consolidation in the industry. Any time we buy a customer like H. D. Smith \u2013 the competitor like H. D. Smith that does change the dynamics in the market. So, as you get to understanding and processing that, others are enjoying in the market. So there has been a lot of activity in the market, and I think it's a market certainly where you could describe it as a buyer's market. So we're very active.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, thanks. I think this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I'll just turn it over to Steve for any closing remarks. And thanks, everyone, for joining us.","Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. So, Keri, thank you. I think we try to be well prepared to explain to you the manageable performance issues we have with PharMEDium and the fact that we see a bright future over there and at Lash as well. We think we've made all the right investments.","Somebody was saying to me that every 483 you get you need to treat it as a learning experience, accept it, prove your standards and prove your qualities. That's what the team at PharMEDium is trying to do. We are the leader in the industry, so we think that upsetting the standard is the way to go.","And then I just would like you to remember that on the 90% of our business we performed very well, and in almost at all cases above expectations and through some very strong trends. So, we are overall really thrilled with the quarter and feel good about the rest of the year. So thank you for your time and attention, and we look forward to being in touch with you at some conferences and certainly on the next earnings call to update you more.","And also, last thing I'll say is that the tax reform worked out spectacularly well for ABC when you think about preserving LIFO, and such a significant benefit not only to EPS but to cash flow also. So we're very pleased with how that's all worked out, and we think that it's just made it a lot fairer for primarily U.S.-based companies like ourselves to compete internationally.","So I wouldn't want to lose that as a very strong \u2013 a lot of you have not heard it already, but it's a very strong change in our business fundamentals, which we are extremely excited about. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's panel, I'd like to thank you for your participation in today's ABC Earnings Call, and thank you for using our service. You have a wonderful day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our fiscal 2012 first quarter results. I'm Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Mike Dicandilo, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2011.","Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by phone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.","Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.","Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.","AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. It will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.","These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.","Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufacture customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provider customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.","Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Overall, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide to the healthcare system.","I've discussed our core tenets several times over the last year but they continue to drive our efforts and that bears repeating. Firstly, collaborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They'll focus on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work beside them.","Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter, up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously-discussed loss of a large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate side segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. ","We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. That is a powerful endorsement of the role that independent retail pharmacy plays in the complex healthcare landscape today.","Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with redistributions and our conversions complete, and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 4%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance in Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based after our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched in the physician marketplace.","In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of introduction. This is a great example, not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also of the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.","AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business both performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.","In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. ","Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we would consider selling larger if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders.","Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.","Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.","In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.","Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg Businessweek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.","As I stated earlier, we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.","Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC set us apart in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike.","Michael D. Dicandilo","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating TheraCom into our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.","As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.","So let's turn to the quarter, and starting with the top line, revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs\/CVS contract. ","The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions, with TheraCom being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth in the quarter.","Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December, and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.","Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We gave an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor scripts. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.","Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.","We did a very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies' ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.","Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year x the impact of our acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons. Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year. Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.","Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously-mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.","Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million, 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.","Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility, and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.","Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.","We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. ","With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in a range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher-ending balance, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and the favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.","With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35%, and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.","Our cash balance of just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with great financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.","Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.","So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business. And despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.","Now here's Barbara for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Mike. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Cara.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Steve, I think you touched on in your prepared remarks briefly, but I was wondering if you could sort of expand a little bit. The competitive landscape obviously has got a lot of attention in the investment community lately, whether it's because of the VA or the impact of the various M&A activity out there potentially. What are you expecting in terms of contract churn over the next year? Similar to the last year? If it's higher, is it because of certain unique reasons? Or do you see sort of the potential for more churn out there because of other types of reasons and maybe decisions that specific customers may be making?","Steven H. Collis","I think that these are really 2 or 3 really isolated events. I mean the VA comes up every 8 years. It's not a surprise to anyone that it comes up in this particular time frame. And obviously, we've gone to great lengths to point out that the industry is a lot different than it was in 2003. And we bid that as you would expect us to bid a large contract. And then, of course, there's been a couple of big M&A deals, which one in particular was not at all expected, but we expect to participate in that. Our focus has been on servicing the companies that we do service to the best of our abilities. And I think we do a great job for them. And we expect that will be a part of any discussion going forward with those businesses. So just to sum it up, the competitive environment remains very similar to how it's been in the past. And we don't have a particular large amount of contracts coming up in the next couple of quarters. I mean, Mike, anything to add?","Michael D. Dicandilo","No, Steve. I think you said it well. The atmosphere is always competitive but stable as you mentioned.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then now just on the follow up there, maybe a smaller topic but there's been some activity around generic Lovenox today. Just curious if you could frame that drug for us and the potential impact, roughly speaking, if there were more supply on the market.","Steven H. Collis","Well, Tom, generic Lovenox, we have done very well with that. It's part of our pro-generics offering and we already have had expectations that there would be competition in the marketplace. And that's built into our expectations.","Operator","The next question comes the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert C. Jones - Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.","Just trying to get a better sense of some of the individual impacts in the quarter. First, I guess in the acquisition side, aside from the announced severance costs, was there an impact on operating expenses from the acquisitions in the quarter? And then I guess along those lines, if you could give us some color around how Lipitor and Zyprexa contributions ultimately shaped up relative to your expectations?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Well, let me -- I'll start with the cost of the acquisitions. I think we highlighted on the face of the P&L that we had $3.6 million of transaction costs related to closing the deal that we did in this quarter, the TheraCom deal. In addition, we obviously have an ongoing operating cost from all 3 of the companies we've acquired in the last few months that are incremental to last year's first quarter. And as I mentioned, they're included in our normal SG&A. And if you took out the normal run -- the ongoing operating costs, our year-over-year SG&A would have been down. So I think that speaks well to the rest of our business and the continued impact of our productivity efforts throughout the company and our continued focus on keeping our costs down.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. And on the 2 big generic launches in the quarter, I mean, we had said on our Investor Day which we really were into the very big one -- the prominent one, we were only about a week or so into it that conversion rates were slightly lower than expected, but it settled down around about that 70% level, which is a little bit less than you'd expect. But it's definitely trending in the right direction. And Zyprexa's right around where we expected it, around 80%. And we performed very much at expectations for both of them with the exception of the Lipitor, which we discussed at Investor Day, but which we now feel is back on track as we sit at the end of January.","Robert C. Jones - Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.","Okay, got it. And just a follow-up, I guess around the buyback, it's $750 million left on the authorization and reiterating the $400 million that's stays in the guidance. I was wondering at what point in the year, what would trigger you to maybe look to upsize the buyback in fiscal '12?","Michael D. Dicandilo","First off, let me just clarify, we've got $380 million remaining on our current authorization. And obviously, our guidance for the year is $400 million of share repurchases. And I think you can look back to our historical performance to understand how we might deploy additional capital for repurchases. If we don't make any other larger strategic moves, we certainly have the capacity to increase the share repurchase. And once again, we've shown that we would do that, similar to what we did last year if that's how the year progresses and we continue to meet our cash forecast. So we're in a very good position.","Operator","The next question comes the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.","Kipp R.F. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Kipp Davis in for Larry. So this is just sort of a follow-up on Lipitor. So it sounds like you're communicating that it came a little bit slower initially than you would expect it in terms of generic conversion. Now you're sort of more comfortable with where it is. Just kind of curious after we think about Zyprexa, and of course, other generics that are going to come on line, how have your thoughts changed for the rest of the year? What do you think some of the key variables are with regard to whether it's manufacturer, strategies, et cetera, that might cause you to change your thoughts about the generic contributions throughout the year?","Steven H. Collis","Yes, this is -- Lipitor was as we said a lot, is really a unique product. I mean, first of all, just the size of it, just the prominence of it. And we think that it's also uniquely a mail-ordered drug. So Pfizer was able to contract with large purchases of the product directly. We think that this is an unusual situation. We don't think it's been particularly successful. And we don't -- we have not changed any of our plans for any other generic launches this year. And as I said, we feel very reassured by the fact that the conversion rate is now approaching 70% and looks like it could go up from there.","Kipp R.F. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up. This is also sort of around consolidation. How do we think about -- with a broadened specialty offering, how do we think about customer consolidation in the specialty space? And would we think that specialty would always be serviced as part of a larger PBM contract or would that sort of business potentially be carved out? How do we think about that sort of relationship there? I don't know if that's a question for James or any of you folks.","Steven H. Collis","Well, you raise a good question. I understand -- I think I understand what you're getting at. First of all, let me distinguish that our Specialty Distribution business is really dealing with physicians who administer products in their office. And there's been numerous articles, there's no doubt that AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group is the leading company in that area. And we're very, very successful there. In our drug company, we do have, within our ultimate side segment, several large companies that are involved with specialty products more on the mail-order side and on the patient delivery side. And we definitely have expertise in servicing those customers. So overall, AmerisourceBergen really services a huge part of the specialty industry, and we expect that to continue. So I hope that's helpful. I think both aspects of the Specialty Distribution are important to our company, important to manufacturers and important to the patients.","Operator","The next question comes the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I realize that all but one of your major customers purchase generics through AmeriSource. But there have been rumblings in the market that perhaps 1 or 2 of the larger retail systems are looking at  internalizing generics, perhaps slowly but are testing the market there. Have you seen any shift in your customers' buying behavior around generics recently? Whether it be asking for greater discounts or looking to perhaps internalize some of the work?","Steven H. Collis","No, I mean obviously, generics are becoming more and more important. They're a bigger part of the prescriptions that the patients get in the U.S. every day, and that's certainly what we expected. But we really haven't seen any different shifts. I mean, we believe that our ProGen formerly and our overall generic offering offers the best everyday value to our customers. And we continue to work very hard at keeping that to be the case. And I think our customers appreciate it, Eric.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. Just one quick follow-up. Another healthcare distributor this morning highlighted that physician activity was slower than they expected. They saw less flu -- seasonal flu impact due to lower illness rates and the weather, obviously. I realize that's also a very small piece of your total business, but can you give us any comments on what you're seeing around primary care and the flu market, both for December quarter and where we are early this year?","Steven H. Collis","The flu vaccine has become a very small part of our over $8 billion in revenues. The most activity actually takes place for flu vaccine in our fourth quarter of our fiscal year, so the September quarter last fiscal year. We have some modest activity in this quarter but it really is primarily now become that September quarter. Of course, our retailers are impacted by seasonal trends. If there's a lot of flu, a lot of cold, that does help patient traffic. But we really focus on overall top line growth, not as much on individual prescription trends at the retail level. So hopefully, that's helpful for you. Mark, anything to add?","Michael D. Dicandilo","No, and they've been good, Eric. We're up year-over-year despite the completion of the Longs\/CVS contract last quarter, which I think is an indication of strength in the top line force.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, you made a comment on the revenue line that you're seeing strength on the hospital side as well as in the independents. Can you maybe just talk about -- is this that you've picked up any incremental customers? Or is there some other reason why you're seeing increased strength in those customers? Because your revenue came in much better than we would've anticipated.","Steven H. Collis","I think we had some mix. I mean, the big customers grew pretty well in the quarter. But our hospital business is -- we believe we have good market share there. And really nothing extraordinary that happened, I mean, just good solid demand for our products.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was -- did revenue come in where you were thinking? Or so do we have it wrong? Or is it just that this is what you were expecting based on what you've seen in your book and all of us got a little carried away on what our expectations were for the impact of generics?","Steven H. Collis","Revenues came in very close to what we're expecting. I mean, maybe slightly ahead of expectations. But very close to what we were expecting.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, as we think about the oncology offices and we think about reimbursement as well as some of the programs for example, that United is doing around bundling of services, et cetera, are you starting to see any change as we move into the next year? And we start thinking about planned design changes and changes with the managed care companies around how they pay for oncology. Has there been any noted change this year?","Steven H. Collis","This discussion has been around for several years and I think it's just really -- it's why our offering is so important. I mean, you look at why we acquired IntrinsiQ and you look at the investments we make in our ION business, our physician services company. We really want to enhance the dialogue between managed care companies and our community oncologists then. Our strategy is not to be a principal in those negotiations, but really to assist our customers so they have the information available and they have the sort of data that managed care companies are looking at. And we think are definitely enhancing that dialogue. It's not -- we're stopping that trend. I think as we sit here today -- I was in D.C. last week and often obviously with some of our large oncology practices, people are starting to recognize us. It's very important to keep cancer care in the community setting, not only from a patient point of view, clinical point of view, but also from an economic point of view. And that's obviously a trend that AmerisourceBergen supports and a big part of what our Specialty Group practice -- is able to demonstrate everyday.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just to understand it, then you're not seeing anything as far as trends go -- and we think about how would it impact your revenue, you're not seeing any changes to utilization or the way that the product is delivered based on these discussions?","Steven H. Collis","No. And again, we've had that SP formerly -- for over 6 years now. So I think our practitioners are used to it. Everything as we said in the release, everything went very well in our oncology business this quarter.","Operator","The next question comes the line of A.J. Rice with Susquehanna.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess because there's so much focus on the VA contract, I'd love to get any perspective you'd be willing to offer on sort of the rebidding and the ask for additional information and say taking a second look, what does that imply about what they're trying to do there? And I guess, I'll ask you a similar question to the one I asked at the Investor Day. If you guys, with what you now know, if you were to be successful and get the contract, would you consider that to be something that would be additive to your results almost immediately?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Yes, A.J., this is Mike. I'll give a go at it and I'll let Steve add any additional comments. But when we got the additional information from the VA, it essentially clarified that there is a small part of purchases approximately 3% that were off contract and clarified that fact and asked us to rebid based upon that new information. I would go back to what we said, when we bid this contract back in June, we considered that to be our last and final bid. We took it very seriously. We considered the new information. We made the appropriate modifications, but it did not change our bid material from what we had done at the end of June. Should we get the VA contract? Yes, we think it would add right away. I think our expectations, it's a several billion dollar contract. There's not many of those out there. And typically, the largest contracts in our industry get the best price. And I would expect this to be similar and have the appropriate contribution for a large contract.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Just maybe then a follow-up on the comments you made in the prepared remarks. I think, maybe Steve made this comment about outpatient in the drug corporation being particularly strong. And I just was wondering -- maybe there's a little more color on what was exactly going on there in your opinion.","Steven H. Collis","I think, A.J., you talked about really our old site? That maybe my accent. That's really our nonhospital institutional business, our mail-order, skilled nursing facility, institutional pharmacy, et cetera. And we did have good revenue trends in that sector. And we have a couple of new customer wins there, particularly we've talked about the Humana contract where we had good revenue performance.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Yes, and I understood it was the alternate site. I guess, that's probably my lingo. I was just curious if it was -- if there was underlying pickup in trend or is it new business? So it sounds like it's mostly new business, maybe?","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Yes, you could say new business. But just good high-growth sector. I mean, benefiting from favorable demographics.","Operator","The next question comes the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess, one real quick follow-up about the VA here. Obviously, investors and analysts are all focused on this contract, but can you tell us essentially when you're in discussions with clients, I mean, is this something that ever comes up? Or is this something that people ever look at and refer to?","Steven H. Collis","No, I think everyone understands that it's a very, very different contract. The way it works, it's very unique both as in the DOD and it doesn't really come up.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then, Mike, maybe a question for you. And I guess this kind of gets back to your original comments about how you see Lipitor come on. When we look at the LIFO charge in the quarter, obviously down less than a year ago. Should we expect that to sort of increase as we see more of this -- the rate of adoption on like Lipitor and some of the other generics come on? Is that a good proxy then for us to think about how the pace of generics are coming onto the course of this fiscal year?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Yes. The LIFO charge as expected, Charles, to be significantly below what it was last year and really 2 reasons. Last year was actually much higher than we expected because of how high the brand price appreciation was. And again our expectation is it's still going to be strong this year but may moderate a little bit versus last year on the brand side. But certainly, with all the new generic introductions and 34 launches, there's going to be a big impact on the generic price deflation this year from products coming off exclusivity. And that has led to lower overall expectation of what a LIFO charge is going to be. And that's really starting in the beginning of the year and will be pretty consistent the rest of the year as a lot of the launches are pretty well spaced throughout the year. And we'll continue to have launches next quarter and all the way through to the end of the year.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And so that sequential change, that's a good signal for us? And was this quarter sort of in line with what you had expected?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Yes. Yes, very much in line. And again, it's a $15 million annual expectation. We're always a little bit higher in the second quarter because that's where a lot of the brand inflation occurs. But otherwise, very much as we expected.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just as a thought to the last question but taking it from a revenue perspective, so you grew revenue at about 2.4% and you're guiding us for flat revenues. So should we assume that second half revenues might decline given the timing of drugs going off 180s that you just mentioned?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Yes, some of that sequential change, Ricky, has to do obviously with our largest customer who only buys brand-name drugs from us and there's more products, though generic, their revs will moderate some over the rest of the year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So when we model, I just want to make sure that our model is kind of like accurate, should we assume kind of like a first half kind of like 2%? And then sort of like negative growth in the second half to get to kind of like flat year-over-year? Or is it going to be smoother than that?","Michael D. Dicandilo","I think it's going to be a little bit smoother.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the generic side, I know we talked a lot about that, but can you quantify kind of like the EPS impact for new generics? Is it back at this quarter? Just to give us a sense of how does it relate to kind of like this $0.05, $0.06 of benefit that you're seeing from Gemzar and Taxotere?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Ricky, I don't think we went -- get into a quarter by quantification of the impact of the new generics. And obviously, what happened last year has an impact as well the year-over-year impact. I think again our guidance for the year's, we expect that the cumulative impact of the 34 launches will offset the decline on the specialty generics side. From a specialty generic perspective, we had about a $0.06 benefit in the first quarter of last year. And this year was pretty similar down about $0.005 or so. Those comparisons will get more difficult the next couple of quarters as they were very big quarters here for Specialty. But I think the beneficial impact of the oral solids will also increase in those next couple of quarters as well. So we really haven't changed our viewpoint on the year about the offset on the oral solid side to the headwind on the specialty generic side.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Directionally, will Lipitor and Zyprexa combine again directionally, no specific numbers higher or lower than that kind of like $0.05 to $0.06?","Michael D. Dicandilo","Again, Ricky, I don't want to get into the quantification. I think we gave a pretty good view at Investor Day that the top 2 players were a significant part of the year, in the 40% range, I believe we gave. And I think that's the best quantification that we want to get into at this time.","Operator","The next question goes to the line of George Hill with Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Mike, I just want to ask another guidance question directionally. I know that you guys don't like to give quarterly guidance but straight expectations for Q2 or for a big number. And as we think about the branded Lipitor to generic conversion, I guess, I'd ask 2 questions, one, do you expect the Pfizer retention rate to stay at the 30-ish percent range? Or how quickly do you guys think that'll continue to fall? And if it hovers at 30%, it would look like the most profitable period for generic Lipitor to kind of be that first month right after May when there's no limit on multisource introductions and the whack probably won't catch up with the falling rate at which you guys can acquire the price. I guess, is it your sense that we might be -- I guess, is the consensus maybe seem too ambitious for fiscal Q2? And maybe should be a little more optimistic on fiscal Q3?","Michael D. Dicandilo","No, I'd say, again we do not -- let me make clear, we do not give quarterly guidance. And directionally, the March quarter has always been our strongest quarter because of the timing and the impact of manufacturer, our brand price increases and the impact that has on some of our fee-for-service agreements, that trend is -- continues to be our expectation this year. Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter, we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solids is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending, I think is, again, very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70:30, that's in line with our expectations. If it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us. But again, I think the historical trending, as far as quarterly progression is still intact, and as I've mentioned, we've got tough comparisons of 2 and 3 on the specialty side, but good performance on the oral solid side. And the fourth quarter continues to be our easiest comparison.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up to Tom's question that's actually where investors worry about clients' trend being unusually high given what's going on in the M&A space. A lot of the big clients tend to see their relationships with the wholesalers as pretty transactional with low switch in costs. What can AmeriSource do, I guess, to make these relationships more sticky?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think obviously, with the smaller customers, we have different services. But in the larger customers, I think we've proven time and again that our relationship to our largest customer is very valuable to them. We were happy to receive the VIP award the last 2 years in a row. And I think we can do different services especially around logistics, cash flow, joint negotiations, even look at some generic lines with large customers. I think there's lots of opportunities in the industry to work together. And then, of course, I just -- I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our specialty franchise, which I think is of great interest to almost anybody in the healthcare space. Specialty is really where the innovation, action's going to be in the years ahead. And definitely our expertise, our physician connectivity, our understanding of the trends there, some of the contracting we do with manufacturers is definitely of interest to all large participants from mail-order to retail to hospital, et cetera.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just to confirm, it sounds like there's no change to the $0.14 to $0.15 EPS expected from the -- in fiscal '12 from the big specialty generics. And then, is the reintroduction of generic Oxaliplatin in August, does that account for any material portion of that? Or is that going to be basically a rounding error at the end of today within fiscal '12?","Michael D. Dicandilo","It's included in the $0.14 to $0.15. But as you said, it's only a little bit more than a month of inclusion in our fiscal '12. But it is in there.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matthew Coffina with Morningstar.","Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. So you said before that Medco is only about 5% of earnings. Maybe to help us get a better understanding of the flexibility in the cost structure here, what, from a specific standpoint -- what, from a practical standpoint, can you do in terms of reducing SG&A when you lose a large customer like that?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think you look at our year and we always do a good job. I think ABC's got a history of always continuing to look for new efficiencies. And we continue that trend I think I highlighted in my remarks. Medco is unusual because we really had very few sites, it's a concentrated delivery, they actually work primarily with our large greenfields, so highly automated facilities. So I think that, that's why we pointed to a 5% contribution that also did contemplate the operating expense increase. But in that particular case, it's unlikely we would shut down any distribution centers or anything like that because of the way the business is currently contracted for and operates. Want to say anything else, Mike?","Michael D. Dicandilo","No, I think that's right. I mean, most of that impact is on the gross profit side. Our expense to serve is very low in that contract as it is with high-volume concentrated location type customers as Steve mentioned.","Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And how do we think about Express Scripts in there, a CuraScript subsidiary? And would that be seen as a competitor to you? And how do you think they'll be thinking about that?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think CuraScript does have the physician distribution business. They also have, I believe, a large amount of order specialty pharmacy business. But nothing extraordinary. We work with all channel participants. We do have some business relationships already with Express Scripts. And obviously, we think that there will be a subject for discussion should the merger be approved.","Operator","There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Barbara Brungess.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Cara. And now, I think Steve would just like to make a few closing remarks.","Steven H. Collis","Yes.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our second quarter fiscal year 2013 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2012.","Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and thank you to everyone for joining us on this busy morning. I'm pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid performance in our second quarter fiscal 2013, with revenues of $20.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.87 in the March quarter, both up 4% over the same period in the prior year.","We had a very difficult comparison in generics this quarter, and we benefited from efforts we made to redeploy capital into share repurchases late last fiscal year and earlier this year. Tim will detail our financial performance and our guidance for the rest of the year. But as we look ahead, there are many moving pieces that will potentially impact our results, and we expect that our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the lower half of the range of $3.04 to $3.14.","We accomplished a great deal in the March quarter. We completed the implementation of our SAP system following the conversion of our last distribution center to the SAP system. We took a few very important steps to significantly strengthen our business, reinvigorate our focus and greatly enhance our opportunities to provide long-term value to all of our stakeholders.","We announced an agreement to sell our contract pharmaceutical packaging business, AndersonBrecon; we signed an agreement to sell our underperforming Canadian drug distribution business; and most importantly, we entered into a new strategic long-term relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. All of these decisions were strategically undertaken to ensure that AmerisourceBergen has further improved our positioning to generate sustainable long-term growth.","ABC already had a strong foundation, and we will now have enhanced scale upon which to continue to develop innovative and value-added services and solutions for all of our customers, both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers alike.","It has been just over a month since we announced our unprecedented new agreement with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. As I said, when we made the announcement on March 19, we have before us an extraordinary opportunity to leverage global supply chain efficiencies and best practices with the largest pharmacy retailer in the U.S. and the leading international pharmacy-led health and beauty group. As we have continued to explore ways to collectively improve patient access to pharmaceuticals while increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system, I am more convinced than ever that this partnership will unlock tremendous value across the supply chain, not only for AmerisourceBergen but for all of our customers and suppliers and our new partners as well.","There are 3 basic components to the new relationship. First, we have signed a 10-year comprehensive primary pharmaceutical distribution agreement with Walgreens, which includes not only branded products but also generics and specialty drugs for Walgreens' retail stores, mail order and specialty pharmacies. The contract is effective September 1, 2013. And while the initial phase will include products that Walgreens has traditionally sourced from distributors and suppliers, over time, AmerisourceBergen will assume the distribution of the products that Walgreens has historically self distributed. This contract significantly expands our historic relationship with Walgreens and will yield $25 billion in incremental revenues for AmerisourceBergen in the fiscal year 2014.","Second, AmerisourceBergen will have access to generics and related pharmaceutical products sourced through the Walgreens-Alliance Boots development joint venture. This relationship will improve AmerisourceBergen's access to globally-sourced products and further strengthen our proprietary approach in formulary. Importantly, AmerisourceBergen will, over time, be able to source products through the JV, not just for the Walgreens stores but for our entire customer base.","I'd like to call our third bucket, \"the platform leverage.\" We have agreed to work collaboratively to share best practices and leverage the expertise of all 3 partners across all of our various platforms. Together, we share a vision for enhancing and preserving the role of community pharmacy throughout the world, and we bring unique capabilities to facilitate that worthwhile goal. I have just returned from the NACDS Annual Event in Florida, where I personally met with many manufacturers and chain customers. At several of the meetings, the 3 companies and our teams had joint meetings. These interactions affirmed that the vision and strategy for our relationship creates truly unparalleled knowledge, capabilities and leadership.","In international markets, we will look cooperatively -- we will work cooperatively with Walgreens and Alliance Boots to expand our manufacturer services businesses and specialty businesses. Alliance Boots' increasing activity with European biotech manufacturers and AmerisourceBergen's expertise in commercialization and patient support services offer manufacturers additional platforms to expand patient access to biotech products in Europe and beyond.","Our goal is to provide manufacturers with integrated solutions for clinical trial logistics, global third-party logistics and product support services by leveraging AmerisourceBergen's market-leading World Courier and Consulting Services businesses and Alliance Boots' vast experience in global markets. I am thrilled with the degree of collaboration we've experienced thus far with our new partners and with the tracking and governance mechanisms we are building into our relationships to ensure we properly measure our respective performance over the long term.","Finally, in consideration of the value creation inherent in this new relationship and in an effort to ensure long-term interest overland [ph], Walgreens and Alliance Boots have given the right to be -- have been given the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over the next 4 years.","Over the long term, we expect significant earnings accretion and other benefits to accrue to AmerisourceBergen as a result of this transaction, and we are very pleased to have our partners' share in our future success. We have submitted all required regulatory filings and are expecting to receive regulatory approval in this current quarter.","In the weeks since we made the announcements, I have personally met and spoken to many of our customers and suppliers, and I am pleased to report that we have been very encouraged by the open and honest dialogue. Across our entire organization, we remain absolutely committed to meeting the needs of all of those with whom we have the privilege of doing business. We have endeavored to demonstrate as broadly as possible that our intent is to strengthen our entire business and thereby provide even greater service and more innovative solutions to all AmerisourceBergen customers and to all of the manufacturers whose products we distribute and support in the marketplace everyday. The healthcare landscape is changing rapidly, and we need to continuously explore ways to drive efficiency without sacrificing the quality of care and service delivered.","Ultimately, we all share the same crucial objective, to help ensure that patients have access to the best possible care and the medication therapies they need to improve their lives. I truly believe it is a great time to be an AmerisourceBergen customer and supplier. In the months and years ahead, we will be making meaningful investments in our core business and infrastructure, and we will be seeking ways to improve the products and services we provide with the help of our global partners.","Turning now to the performance of our business units in the March quarter. Revenues in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation were up 4%, due primarily to an increase in sales volume resulting from our previously announced new contract with our largest -- with our large PBM customer, offset in part by the loss of a food and drug combo GPO earlier in the year. ABDC's revenues will of course ramp significantly in the second half of the year, as we begin to on-board the volume from the new Walgreens contract.","We have already begun the process of incorporating the store locations into our store systems, and we have continued to run tests and pilots over the course of the summer and even to begin to shift certain lines to ensure a smooth transition on September 1. We've also already begun to look at opportunities for enhancing our Good Neighbor Pharmacy programs with the help of Walgreens and Alliance Boots, whether it is through an improved Pro Generics formulary, proprietary front-of-store products or new share clinical systems that will facilitate third-party contracting, we believe there will be compelling new offerings for our independent customers in the years ahead. Our new partners share our goal of strengthening Good Neighbor Pharmacy and enhancing and preserving the role of independent community pharmacy.","Our institutional segment, including both hospitals and alternate sites, continues to perform very well. We have made significant progress in expanding some of our best-in-class specialty capabilities into the hospital market in an effort to continue to support physicians to treat oncology patients even as the site of care sometimes changes.","As the specialty markets evolve, we want to -- we continue to find innovative ways to support all of our customers who want to care for patients, who are being treated with specialty products.","Operating income in ABDC was down year-over-year as expected due to the decline in operating margin, which resulted from the implementation of the new large PBM customer contract and fewer significant generic launches available to offset that pressure in the quarter.","Overall, trends in brand inflation, generic utilization and even generic price inflation continue to be positive. As I mentioned earlier, we have very difficult comparisons on generic launches in fiscal 2013, but those improved significantly in fiscal 2014. We will see further operating margin degradation in fiscal 2014 as a result of on-boarding the Walgreens contract. But once we anniversary the impact, we fully expect to return to a model where we are able to meaningfully increase our operating margins on an annual basis.","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group revenues were up 4% in the quarter due to strong sales in ICS, our third-party logistics business, as well as in ASD and Besse. We had somewhat disappointing results in our Oncology business, as physician practices continue to face economic challenges in the face of declined reimbursement rates.","Clearly, there has been pressure on specialty physicians, especially those in smaller practices. In addition, under the sequestration legislation, Medicare physician reimbursement rates for part B drugs were cut on April 1 from a rate of average selling price, or ASP, plus 6% to a rate of ASP plus 4%. We have been hard at work in Washington to help members of Congress and regulators at CMS and elsewhere to understand that physician reimbursement has not just been cut by 2%, it is essentially been cut by over 30%.","Specialty physicians and specialty oncologists who had already maintained an ASP plus 6% was inadequate reimbursement to -- for physicians -- to reimburse physicians for the services rendered to procure, store and administer Part B drugs.","As we have previously noted, we have seen a trend of small practice selling -- small practices selling to larger practices or, in some cases, to hospitals. We continue to believe that patients are best served in the community practice setting. Not only do patients tend to have better outcomes, but the cost of care are lower in the community setting. We are hopeful that, at a minimum, the sequestration cuts will be reversed. But at this time, it is difficult to know when or by what mechanism that would occur.","Furthermore, since the reimbursement rate just changed on April 1, we cannot be certain if we have seen the full impact of the rate cuts at this time. It is possible that the growth rates of our sales to specialty physicians, both oncologists and other specialists, may continue to slow over the course of the second half of our fiscal year.","Fortunately, as Oncology sales have slowed, our other specialty businesses have been growing at above market rates. These businesses do what -- do have somewhat lower margins than Oncology business does, so there has been a mix shift towards lower margin businesses in ABSG, and that growth was not enough to overcome the decline in the contribution from Oncology.","While the specialty market is changing and working through near-term challenges, our specialty franchise remains a key differentiator for AmerisourceBergen and an important driver of our long-term growth. The investments we have made to ensure that we are participating, to some degree, in the entire life cycle of biotech and other products across all sites of care, combined with the efforts we have made to strengthen our core business and expand our customers' ability to provide specialty products, gives me great confidence that we will continue to be the leading-edge partner for all who care for patients who require specialty products.","Revenues in the segment that is comprised of our manufacturing services business was up 47% due in large part to contributions from World Courier, which were not included in the prior year.","Operating income was up 5% over the prior year, which was below our expectations, as some sluggishness that we experienced in the December quarter carried over into the March quarter, particularly in World Courier. We are seeing signs of improvement in April, and we expect World Courier to have a strong second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very excited about the long-term potential for our manufacturer services businesses, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the global marketplace.","Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate a theme I mentioned earlier. AmerisourceBergen has always been deeply committed to the pharmaceutical supply channel. The investments we've made in our own business and through acquisitions over the last few years have strengthened our platform. And our new strategic long-term relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots dramatically improves our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth for all of our stakeholders.","As I look ahead, I have great confidence that we invested in the right markets and that we'll be able to meet our long-term growth objectives of mid-teens earnings per share growth even with the dilution impact expected from the warrants that were issued to Walgreens and Alliance Boots. There has never been a better time to be a customer, supplier, associate, shareholder or other stakeholder in AmerisourceBergen. We have a great deal of work ahead of us, but I am confident that our associates will continue to bring dedication and creativity to every task and opportunity that lies ahead and that we will continue to meet, if not exceed, the expectations that all our partners have in us.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to report another solid quarter for ABC. As has been our practice, my comments on our financial results will be on a GAAP basis. Near the end of my prepared comments, we will provide forward-looking guidance for non-GAAP adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year.","We are now at the halfway point of our fiscal year 2013, and we're pleased with our progress in what we knew would be a challenging year. As a reminder, last year's March quarter had the full benefit of 2 high-volume generics, which were in their exclusivity periods.","The highlights for the current March quarter are: solid top line growth in both our core drug business and specialty even with 1 less business day; growth in our generic revenues, excluding the customer lost that Steve mentioned; and very good free cash flow. And as a result, our cash balance is north of $1 billion again.","This quarter, we had 3 announcements related to transactions. During my prepared comments, I will cover financial reporting impacts from our new Walgreens-Alliance Boots relationship and the pending sale transactions with Drug Canada and AndersonBrecon. We are now classifying Drug Canada as a discontinued operation. Their quarter and year-to-date operating results have been removed from our March 13 and March 12 results from continuing operations. Additionally, the estimated loss on the sale of Drug Canada is also recorded in discontinued operations. AndersonBrecon had previously been classified as a DO in our fourth quarter 2012. The gain on the sale of AndersonBrecon will be recorded within the DO line upon transaction closing.","Let's start our review of current second quarter results. Revenues were $20.5 billion, up about 4% compared to last year's quarter. This is solid performance even with the headwind from the difference in generic conversions year-over-year.","Our revenue growth was primarily due to our new PBM contract beginning last October. Gross profit was $717 million in the current quarter, up 5.5% compared to last year's quarter with a gross margin of 3.49%. Our World Courier acquisition contributed roughly $65 million of gross profit in the current quarter. Excluding World Courier, our gross profit was down year-over-year due to lower contributions from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, operating expenses were $367 million, up about 21%. This increase is due primarily to the operating cost of World Courier, which were not in the prior year. This quarter marks the first quarter that we have an expense associated with warrants that we issued to Walgreens and Alliance Boots. We used an independent third party to calculate the fair value of the warrants.","At March 31, the warrants had a value of $314 million, using a binomial lattice model approach. Per the accounting rules, we started to expense these warrants from the date of issuance, March 18 through March 31, about $3.8 million. We will account for these warrants under variable instrument accounting rules. And as a result, the fair value has to be remeasured each quarter end based on valuation assumptions, which include our stock price and volatility of our stock price. Consequently, the expense will not be a fixed amount each quarter.","Moving to operating income. We had $350 million in the current quarter, a decrease of about 7%. The decrease is due to lower gross profit in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Our operating margin was 1.71%, down by 20 basis points compared to last March quarter.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $18.5 million in the March quarter decreased 21% compared to last year.","Moving to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate in the current March quarter dropped to 38.3%. This is the result of reclassifying Drug Canada to discontinued operations. For the full fiscal year, we'd expect our tax rate to be in the range of about 38.2% for continuing operations.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the current March quarter was $0.87. The warrant expense equivalent to a $0.01 negative was not contemplated in guidance previously given. Adding back the $0.01 means we would be at $0.88 on a non-GAAP adjusted EPS basis, an increase of $0.04 or about 5% over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from an 11% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding versus the prior year's quarter.","At March 31, 2013, we had about 231 million shares outstanding. We did not buy back any shares during the current March quarter.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the March quarter, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $20.1 billion, up by about 3.5% versus the same quarter last year.","The increase was due to 2 primary drivers: One, growth at our drug company, about 4%. As mentioned previously, new volume from our PBM customer, offset by the contract wind-down of our food drug combo GPO customer; and, two, growth at our Specialty business, about 4%, specifically our ASD, Besse Medical and ICS businesses, offset by weaker-than-expected revenue performance in our Oncology business. These sales growth percentages are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we've communicated these percentages in the past.","Total segment operating income decreased $34 million or 9% to $329 million in the current second quarter. Most of the decrease is related to the drug company. Drugs decrease is due to lower contributions from our PBM contract and the lost of the food drug combo GPO contract. We also had a sizable headwind from oral solid generic launches, offset somewhat by better generic price appreciation.","In terms of Specialty, they had higher contributions directly related to the increased revenues at ASD, Besse medical and ICS. However, these increases could not offset the decrease from our Oncology business. As Steve mentioned, Oncology's income is being negatively impacted from lower revenues, as community practices face more challenging economics due to the changing government reimbursement. We expect this trend to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Moving to the other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. Segment revenues increased nearly $140 million to $435 million. Most of the increase is from World Courier. This business did experience some revenue softness, as new business slowed somewhat in late calendar 2012 and is carried over into our March quarter. However, we are starting to see an improved pipeline for customer RFPs. And recently, we've had several account wins that will positively impact our June and September results.","Operating income for the Other segment increased about $1 million or about 5% from the same quarter last year. The increase is related to contributions from World Courier. Our Consulting business had a decrease in operating income due to higher operating costs, as they ramp up for new initiatives.","Previously, we've given guidance that World Courier would contribute $0.06 to $0.10 of earnings this fiscal 2013. We now expect to be near the lower end of this range due to the revenue softness we are cycling through. We remain positive about the prospects for meaningful, long-term returns from World Courier. And as Steve mentioned, we now see even greater opportunities further out, as we explore new business with Walgreens and Alliance Boots globally.","Switching gears, I'd like to comment on our 2 announced business sales, both recorded in the discontinued operations line and our P&L. We are waiting for regulatory approval on both transactions. We expect that both transactions will close in the June quarter. For Drug Canada, in our March 2013 quarter, we have recognized expense of $166 million in the DO line. Almost all of this is related to the expected loss on sale.","Now let's turn to our cash flow. Overall, we are pleased with our free cash flow performance for the current March quarter. We generated about $950 million of free cash flow in the 3 months ended March 2013. For the current 6-month period, we now stand at approximately $655 million of free cash flow, about the same level as last year. Some of the free cash flow benefit was a result of timing. Our last business day in March was a Friday. Friday is typically our strongest AR collection day, and AP invoices due over the weekend were paid Monday. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion.","Before I provide fiscal 2013 guidance, let me cover quickly key updated fiscal 2012 numbers since our financials will be revised to pull Drug Canada out of continuing operations. We'd expect to issue adjusted fiscal 2012 ABC consolidated and segment quarterly numbers via an 8-k soon after we file our March 10-Q. Total consolidated revenues will be revised to $78.1 billion. Consolidated operating income will be revised to $1.3 billion. And finally, diluted EPS from continuing operations will be revised to $2.96.","Now let's cover our fiscal 2013 guidance.","EPS. Our full year non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations remains unchanged, a range of $3.04 to $3.14, which excludes 2 items: one, the negative impact from warrant expense that we recorded in SG&A; and, two, the expected LIFO charge from on-boarding the Walgreens brand distribution business. We now expect to be in the lower half of the range due to lower contributions primarily from our Oncology business and also a $0.02-negative impact from dilution on applying the treasury stock method of accounting to the warrants.","Going forward, whenever our average quarterly stock price exceeds the average strike prices of the warrants, then the warrants will be dilutive to our share count for EPS purposes including the September -- including the June and September quarters.","One final comment about adjusted EPS guidance. Our guidance includes the effect of revising our Q1 2013 EPS results from continuing operations, as we have pulled out Drug Canada and classified it as a discontinued operation. Keep in mind that we'll have deal cost in the June quarter and on-boarding cost including the one-time Walgreens rebate in the September quarter. Based on this, we now expect our adjusted EPS to be pretty even for the June and September quarters.","Our key guidance assumptions are as follows: Revenue growth. Revenue growth will now be in the 11% to 13% range off the revised fiscal 2012 revenues. We expect revenues to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2013, as we begin to service certain lines of Walgreens prior to September 1 and add new brand lines for our large PBM customer. Additionally, the headwind from brand-to-generic conversions decreases significantly in the second half of our fiscal year.","Operating income and margin. We have many moving parts. And because of this, our operating income will now be down 3% to 5% for the year as compared to the revised fiscal '12 operating income.","Let me cover operating income dollars first, and this excludes any impact from the warrant expense and the LIFO expense. The 2 drivers of the operating income decrease are: one, deal cost and the ramp-up of operating expenses, including the one-time rebate we're paying, again, in quarters 3 and 4, respectively; and, two, lower contributions now from our oncology business and somewhat lower contributions from World Courier and the delay in reducing legacy IT operating costs where we previously expected to see savings in our September quarter.","Additionally, our operating margin will decrease in the 24 to 29 basis point range from the revised fiscal '12 margin of 1.67%. This represents a decrease in our operating margin of 16 to 17 basis points from our previous guidance. The decrease in margin is due to the 2 items I just mentioned.","Additionally, the third item negatively impacting margin is the increase in revenues from our PBM customer and the new Walgreens contract. These 3 items I called out are all negatively impacting margin by about 5 to 6 basis points each.","Free cash flow. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million, which includes the significant working capital build to support the Walgreens contract. This includes CapEx of at least $220 million.","Share repurchases. Our share repurchase expectation continues to be $400 million in fiscal 2013.","Before I wrap up, let me comment briefly on LIFO. We continue to operationalize the Walgreens contract. This means that we are working to understand the brand inventory build, primarily occurring in July and August. For example, the brand inventory build could be $1 billion or more. This means we are likely to have an unusually high mix of branded inventory at fiscal year end. As we have commented in the past, brand inflation has been in the 9% to 10% range the last couple of years. This could translate to a non-cash LIFO expense of $100 million or more.","In our June quarter, we expect to be able to forecast our annualized LIFO expense, as we'll have clarity on brand inventory requirements. This means that we will be in a position to record a 9-month true-up to our LIFO annualized expense. The remaining 25% of the annualized LIFO expense will be recorded in the September quarter.","One final LIFO comment. The incremental EPS benefit of $0.20 in fiscal 2014 from the Walgreens-Alliance Boots transaction that we highlighted on March 19 did not include a LIFO assumption, given the","complexities around LIFO and the timing of on-boarding the Walgreens generic business.","This wraps up my prepared comments this morning. I appreciate your patience as we work through the financial details and thank you for your continued interest in ABC.","Now here's Barbara for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from the line of Mr. Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So, Steve, you mentioned the joint venture and how this benefits the ProGen program from the better generic purchasing. Before AmerisourceBergen was included with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, Walgreens had sized what they thought the purchasing synergies were from their joint venture. Can you maybe just help us think about the potential savings that could be realized over time from this particular part of the agreement with Walgreens and Alliance Boots?","Steven H. Collis","So first of all, this is a fairly complex work that involves many other parties, the generic manufacturers, these are global organizations. Almost all of them -- we met with the CEOs of all of these organizations over the last few days, and almost all of them have established relationships with all 3 companies. So we really are creating an unprecedented platform here, and it's going to take time. We are a significant amount of generic volume to almost all of these suppliers' global business. So we're going to be very thoughtful and planful about this. We really expect that the benefits from the Walgreens-Alliance Boots development relationship would really start accruing in fiscal year 2015, which will also coincide with when we have the full run rates for the generic distribution. But we expect that this will be significant because we think we've got a significant value proposition back to the manufacturers, the scale that we have, the ability to do long-term contracting. And that message is really being well received. These various conversations that -- I had an accelerated amount of conversations in the last few days. We did a lot of those conversations on a joint basis and have been very encouraging. So we think that this is going to be probably one of the most significant areas of opportunity that we have between the 3 companies, especially from 2015 on.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. I guess, also, Steve, you mentioned the goal of significantly improving margins beyond fiscal '14 and kind of ties into this arrangement. But I mean, can you give us any goalpost around your expectations? I mean, can the company -- given its customer mix and factoring in this unique contract, can it get back to historical operating margin levels? And is that something you're thinking about in the next few years?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Hey, Bob. It's Tim. I'll take this one. Again, Steve, in his comments, mentioned meaningful growth in the operating margin expansion. Again, we have to cycle through the on-boarding next year. But getting to '15 and beyond, historically, we've been in the high-single digit kind of range. And again, I think we will get back there in terms of growth. And that's our expectation.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, Tim, while I have you. I know back when the arrangement was struck, there was some discussion around hedging around the warrant dilution. Any update there? And is that something you guys are still contemplating?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes -- no, great question. We did talk about it. We continue to do a fair bit of work on hedging. We're at the point now where we're looking at some different alternatives, Bob. And we have a Board Meeting in the middle of May, where we're going to make some recommendations. So we're -- we'll have an update in the June quarter, but it's still top of our list to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, first, a housekeeping one maybe for Tim. I just want to make sure. It sounds like the cost to sort of implement the Walgreens contract and deal-related costs are included in the guidance as sort of a negative. So, a, is that right? And, b, care to size maybe what you're going to be spending to implement it?","Tim G. Guttman","No, it's -- Tom, I mean, you're right. It is in our guidance. We called that out, again, one of the reasons why our margin is down. We called out the basis point drop, so definitely in our guidance. We don't want to really call out the specific pieces. I did give some kind of a broad range, broad stroke in terms of about 5 to 6 basis points for that first bucket, which is the deal costs, on-boarding costs which includes the rebate. So that's about as far as we're willing to go at this point.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Steve, in your prepared remarks, you talked about lots of customer -- lots of conversations with various constituencies, including customers. I think some of us had done our own work, talking to people in the channel. But can you maybe dive a little deeper into the conversations that you had and what customers are asking you in terms of both the opportunities that they are looking for as a result of this and as well as some of the concerns, maybe, that you've heard and how you sort of balance of those?","Steven H. Collis","Yes. When we made the announcement, obviously, it was a big news. I think we really caught a lot of people by surprise, which is a good thing. We -- given that it was a very confidential relationship. So I think we had -- there was definitely about as much upside or downside in the communication plan as maybe in any other investment or transaction contract that we've entered into and, certainly, in my experience. So the team was very well prepared. We've met with all of our top 20 customers in person. We've met with, as I said, all the key suppliers. And I think, we've got long-term relationships with many of the customers, and our industry tends to have long-term relationships and very integrated relationships with our customers. So I think the history of our industry has been that the wholesalers being strong is good for the customers, and this agreement, we believe, strengthens our -- strengthens and adds to our long-term prospects in a virtuous way. So those conversations, we've been able to do in person, and we've all been very active. And I think that the tone is really -- they ended up in a very good way. People understand this. We've had to talk through the equity component as being one of the concerns. Board seats, we've discussed. The Board seat lands up being commensurate with the holdings in AmerisourceBergen. These various options and the right to purchase stock in the open market. We've had to explain all these different things. We've got very large sophisticated customers. We've got smaller customers. We've got large suppliers that probably understand what Walgreens-Alliance Boots development corporation was -- their goals were. We've got some that have never heard about that before. So we really are -- we've been very planful, very thoughtful. But I'll sincerely tell you that where we sit 1 month off the announcement is in a good place with the majority of our customer -- almost all of our customers and suppliers.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe if I could just follow up. Tim, I was kind of curious about -- just looking at the year-over-year results in the Drug Corporation, it kind of seems like the operating profit was maybe down a little bit more than maybe what I expected, and it sounds like you're suggesting that maybe Lipitor and Zyprexa sort of being on that exclusivity this quarter last year had a big point to do with that. But as you move out into 2Q, if we were to strip out the specialty issue, as well as some of the start-up costs around WAG, is your overall drug businesses a positive year-over-year in terms of operating profit?","Tim G. Guttman","Glen, we are down in Q2 in this segment, right? And I gave a little bit of color in terms of -- most of that being drug, probably 2\/3, drug; about 1\/3, specialty. Moving out for the second half of the year though, Drug will be down year-over-year even if you strip out some of those items. Again, most of that do what we said from day 1, just a very challenging full year generic comparison and repricing of the PBM contract.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I could just ask one follow-up then. It kind of sounds like, within the Oncology business, that the challenging environment is going to persist into the second half of the fiscal year, and I think you sort of called out that it's just a challenging environment for the community specialists. And can you just elaborate a little bit more on that, Steve, and maybe what's driving that and what the issue is and then ultimately how you rectify that situation to sort of reinvigorate the growth within that segment?","Steven H. Collis","Thanks, Glen. It's an excellent question. So I've been -- I had 19 years with the company last week and almost all of that has been closely watching oncology business. These are very smart businesspeople. They're dealing with very expensive therapies. And the ASP plus 6% has been -- for Medicare, which is typically about half of each practice, is somewhat finely balanced. It's more or less of a -- you could say almost a breakeven on a lot of these therapies. They don't often actually buy entirely ASP because of some other measurement in the reimbursement calculation. So cutting this down by 2% was not expected. So as we've got into the end of March, I think a lot of practices started looking at their patients and maybe looking at treating Medicare patients in a different way or referring them to hospitals. So we started to see some impact. And that could be further accelerated. Yes, depending on what happens with the sequestration cuts, there could be some budget resolutions in the next quarters. But everyone is well aware that you don't need me to pile on the situation in Washington, but it's extremely frustrating. I have personally been along with James Frary, Peyton Howell, Rita Norton. A lot of our leaders are just very, very engaged in Washington in trying to explain that this is not a 2% cut. And we took the time in our comments to illustrate why this is not a 2% cut for that small part of the margin spread that our customers are receiving. It is somewhat to a 30% to 40% cut in that already fairly long margin. So it's a concern, and it could accelerate larger practices acquiring smaller practice, which is a good trend for us. We have a lot of the larger practices on ION and members on Oncology Supply customers. But we've also seen -- say, for example, take a town like Louisville, Kentucky. 5 years ago, there were over 20 community practices, there's only a handful now. And what's happened is that the hospitals have acquired them and, many times, those become 340B practices, and about 1\/3 of the case about AmerisourceBergen customers. So it's not like we lose the business, but you lose the patients to community setting. We don't have a comparative to ION in the hospital setting. And it's why we have been adjusting some of our business goals to look at oncology more in different sites of care sometimes it's based on oral formulation, sometimes it's based on oncology in a hospital setting or a heart patient setting, so -- or a specialty pharmacy setting. So I think I probably answered a lot on that question, but I hope that's -- it's a complicated issue. And as you can see, we're on it. Our group is as well positioned in the industry as we've ever been, but these are issues that could really change the way cancer patients get treated.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Willoughby of Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, maybe it's kind of a same question. But do you really think it's realistic to assume the higher inflation rate on the specialty drugs continuing? I mean, aren't you expecting other cost management efforts by healthcare payers to contain that trend and wouldn't that influence your business?","Steven H. Collis","Yes. So manufacturers take price increases. That doesn't mean that the ultimate med pricing goes up by that much. It gives specialty drugs -- the physician-administered, like part B-type drugs, I would say -- I don't have the exact data in front of me, but it's not as high as 8% to 9%, which is our traditional brand inflation, and it would not be feasible to do that because of Part B reimbursement. When we talk about specialty drug inflation as being in therapies, like, for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis in particular has had very high brand inflation. And that has slowed somewhat this year. All right? Tim, do you have any comment?","Tim G. Guttman","No, I think you're right, Steve. It's just not -- the trends on the oral solid, you just don't see on the specialty side.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What are the payers doing? How are they slowing that rheumatoid arthritis trend?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think a lot of it has been managed by limited networks. One of the visions for our partnership is to do more specialty products in the community setting, whether it's through -- it's Walgreens, Good Neighbor Pharmacy. I think a lot of our customers are very interested in that. We have a very strong what we call an alternate site segment. That's something that we're planning to have a specialty network that's for qualified participants that AmerisourceBergen has been very involved in. And then, we do a lot of work with payers and try help them understand what some of the trends are. And I'd note the growth in our Consulting Services business, which helps with not only patient access, but with managed care communication planning, product launch support, including pricing decisions, comparative effectiveness -- these sort of areas. So we've got well-developed practices. Whatever the need of the manufacturer or the provider is -- and I think we're going to have -- we're going to be a key participant in any of the sites of care or any of the different formulations that arise.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Hill of Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe to follow up on Glen and Bob's question, Tim, can you talk a little bit about the severity of the impact in the Oncology business and maybe remind us, again, about how big oncology is inside the specialty business and kind of the rate at which you're seeing the deceleration?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, Bob, I mean -- or, George, I'm sorry. Let me just -- again, on Glen's comment, I talked about that. For this quarter, we had about a $33 million change in that segment, operating income, again, about 2\/3 by drug, 1\/3 is related to specialty. And we did have really good growth from our 3 businesses: the ASP, Besse and Medical -- Besse Medical and ICS. Just not enough to offset Oncology. So I mean, we don't want to get into a lot of specifics. But again, you can kind of look at what I just provided there. Oncology is about 40% of ABSG revenues. Those 3 businesses I talked about are about 60%. And again, if you put Oncology in perspective with ABC, it's probably 7% of total ABC. So again, clearly an important business. But we are starting to see, as Steve mentioned, some revenue declines that are persisting, and we felt it was appropriate to call them out as we go forward in the 3 and 4.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Now that's great color. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up. Given you're taking about the mix shift...","Steven H. Collis","I'll just make one clarifying comment. It's important -- when we talk about Oncology, we're talking specifically about Oncology Supply and ION businesses. And that enables us to -- the physician services and contracting we do in ION had been very meaningful. And when we do other sites of care, we don't get those contract benefits. So that's why it's been important. It's been, as you know, a great business for ABC. We've been a great partner to Oncology. So when we talk about Oncology -- here, in this context, we're talking about specifically the Oncology Supply and ION businesses. We are doing a lot of other Oncology in our ICS business, in our ASD business and more and more in our health systems business, where we think we're doing over $4 billion in Oncology sales into the hospital channel. So I just think it's important to clarify some of that.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Steve, that's great clarification. And then, I guess one of my follow-up question was going to be, is it seems a lot of this could be stemming also from the 340B initiatives at the hospital organizations, all the data that I see would seem to indicate that they all want to step up kind of 340B program launches and utilization. I guess, can you talk about how you expect that to impact mix?","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Well, we service a lot of 340B hospitals. I mean, there has been a trend, I believe, that 40% of the hospitals in the U.S. are now 340B-enabled or eligible. And so -- and we're going to see what the impacts of the Affordable Care Act implementation are but -- and what's going to happen with the accountable care organizations. So again, some of these trends are very interesting. You should be assured that ABC is monitoring that. We believe we're well positioned. But we're pointing out here it does affect our mix and the margin implementations, depending upon mix -- how mix changes based on different sites of care and different changes. But we -- some of these trends, we will keep on trying to point them out to you when we have clear indications of where they're going. But not -- they are about as many moving parts in the whole health system as in any time in my career.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just to drill down on Tom's earlier question a little bit further. I guess, besides just positive discussion with customers, I think there may already be some recent contract renewal examples, like in service, tangible evidence of customers not worried about potential conflicts of Walgreens. So I guess, just without going into specific details, can you just confirm whether or not you've already made some progress in renewing some retail contracts following the announcement of Walgreens?","Steven H. Collis","Well, thanks, Steve. We did resign our largest buying group customer, that's about 1,000 stores, $2 billion in revenue. I personally met with their Board over the last few weeks and many of their members, and they understand what we're trying to do here. Again, I think one of the key comments I made, our new relationship with Walgreens really is pro the channel. We're bringing a tremendous amount of lines into the system. We're enhancing the productivity we're going to have in our distribution centers. And the independents understand that the wholesale industry is their best friend. And so, some of the benefits that we're going to be having, which is -- looking at the clinical platform together, looking at third-party contracting, I think definitely one of the immediate benefits I am seeing is the front-store -- what can we do to help GNP stores do even a better job in the front-store requirements that their customers are expecting in a newer, more modern environment orientation towards healthier products, more vaccines, et cetera. So we've talked to all these, and I think our customers are trusting us on this. And they will see us bring more benefits to their Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. And I think the recent signing is -- was a vote of confidence in us, absolutely.","Operator","Or next question will come from the line of Ms. Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions around point of clarification. Tim, when you talked about 2015 and you talked about high-single digits, were you talking about margins in 2015 as being a high-single digit or the growth rate that you think you can get back to in 2015?","Tim G. Guttman","Growth rate. The bps -- increase in bps, Lisa.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, secondly, Steve, I know you made a lot of comments around global opportunities with Alliance Boots and Walgreens. Have you identified anything specifically that you think that will have some impact in the next year or so? Or do you believe there's longer-term opportunities?","Steven H. Collis","I think in terms of meaningful earnings, to be honest, I don't think we'll see anything in the business [indiscernible] next year. We're working on a couple of joint manufacturers services RFP responses. If those work, that could be great test cases. But some of these programs are a lot smaller. I think there could be chances to make investments collaboratively between the 3 of us, but those are dependent on the right opportunities emerging and that fit the criteria. And of course, we all 3 are independent companies, and we've got our own set of respective shareholders. So -- but when I talked about that third bucket -- just again, some of the meetings we had this week, we're really moving the dial up. This transaction that we announced has caught a lot of people's attention, and I believe it's -- people are waking up to the fact that it's a truly unique global platform with tremendous leadership capabilities, talents on all sides of the table. So I am really bullish on what the relationship is going to mean to our shareholders and customers.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you think that others will have to respond to this, Steve? Do you think we'll see other type of purchasing consortiums on a global basis because of this, based on the conversations you've been having out in the marketplace?","Steven H. Collis","Yes. I mean, it's a great question, and I understand why you'd asked it. But it's not up to me to speculate on what the outcomes could be. I mean, we saw the announcements this morning. So again, I think all of the large U.S. wholesalers do a great job. We all are very tight with our customers. And I think it's just hard. Again, there's not many Walgreens out there, there's not many Alliance Boots out there. And of course, I am particularly proud of AmerisourceBergen's capabilities and position in the channel.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I have some follow-up question here. So first of all, just a point of clarification, hinting to Lisa's point, you're saying that you're going to see a single-digit basis points growth or expansion in margin once '14 -- the base year of '14 is behind you. So should we basically -- when we think about our long-term models and the impact here, should we think about AmerisourceBergen going back to a '13 type of margin by 2016?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Ricky, again, I mean, it's early. We're still -- we haven't even looked at plans. I mean, we got a lot of runway to go here. But certainly, our goal has always been to lap and to on-board Walgreens the best we can, best to our abilities and then, in '15, start getting back to historical growth, which again is at high-single digit is what we need to get our EPS in the mid-teens. So I mean, at this point, I think that's pretty much all I'd like to say. But we're very confident we can do that especially when you get out to those years. As Steve mentioned earlier, we have the benefits of the procurement JV kind of kicking in and, again, with a slower ramp-up. But we're confident that we can get to the high-single digits.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, I know it's very early on, but have you seen any change in the competitive behavior from your distribution peers?","Steven H. Collis","I mean, Ricky, it's a very good question. But, no, we don't expect it to be. No, I don't think so. No, I'll -- It's -- again, it's only a month. But, no, we don't think so. We think, again, all 3 of us are public companies. We report to shareholders, and I -- we don't expect that there should be any discernible change in competitive trends because of this transaction.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowens.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A question for Tim here. Can you go over the -- your comments here on the LIFO charge and how you expect that to come out? And then, can you help walk us through sort of how that will impact? And when we think about fiscal '14, you kind of made some comments about it's not being incorporated into the sort of $0.20 incremental benefit from Walgreens?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Sure, Charles. Let me go back and recap LIFO. It's a certainly complicated area. It really depends on how we on-board, how much inventory we have to build. We're working through that conversion plan, which will probably be done in the end of May. So we'll have a much better idea again. And just how much brand inventory we have to bring on. But the service to large customer [indiscernible] locations. Again, for the '13 impact, you have to bring on a lot of brand inventory. And again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, it's really going to impact the mix. Bringing -- typically, in inflation, right, in LIFO, you have high brand inventory, high inflation rate, but you also have generics. Well we won't have that generic inventory from Walgreens until next year. So again, that's the reason why we're going to have the high LIFO expense this year. Again, the way we do our calculation is we always estimate LIFO on a full year basis. So when we're in June and we close the June books, we'll basically have to do a catch-up entry on that full year. So we'll have to book 9 months a year-to-date true-up. So again, whatever entry -- whatever number we come up with, 9 months of that will be booked in the June quarter and then the remaining 25% in the September quarter, again, non-cash item. The other -- and again, your second question about '14 is kind of what I covered earlier. It's just, at this point, we haven't calculated anything on LIFO for '14. I think it's clear it will be less because we're going to transition generics during '14. But at this point, we don't still don't know how quickly that will come and when we'll get that business fully on-boarded. So when we know more details later in the year, we'll update everyone.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But so -- but when we think about '14 though -- because we're going to take the charge here in fiscal '13 and we'll have some generics in '14, the absolute number will be less, right? So...","Tim G. Guttman","Absolutely. I'd fully expect, again, kind of knowing what I know today, that, that charge will be less in '14, again, because we're going to have some amount of the generic inventory that will offset that brand high inflation. So, yes, definitely less.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And just one last clarification on that is -- In your guidance, you don't back out LIFO charges or credits, right, even though we know them as being noncash?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, typically in the past, LIFO has always been in our GAAP numbers, right? I mean, everything we presented historically, LIFO has been in. But this year, for '13, because it's such a large number, it's moving around. We don't fully know the number. It's not in our forward-looking guidance for '13. In that $3.04 to $3.14, there's no LIFO impact in there. And again, in the number that we gave for incremental for '14, there's no LIFO assumption there either.","Operator","And that last question will come from the line of Mr. John Ransom of Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can we just recap, just to make sure everybody has this. When you talk about your new guidance, results coming at the bottom of the range, can you just total up, again, what was not contemplated in your original guidance, so we can have kind of an apples-to-apples look?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, sure, John. I mean, really, that -- it kind of comes down to a couple of things. One being the change in the -- in what I would call the base business. I mean, the softness in the Oncology revenues, mostly a little bit of softness in World Courier. And the third item there is just -- we always talked about getting some benefit to our P&L in the fourth quarter post SAP implementation. And again, we won't have that. So those 3 items really impacted our guidance. And...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So you're not including the warrant dilution and you're not including...","Tim G. Guttman","No, let me get to that. That's one bucket, and the other bucket is clearly a couple of pennies from warrant dilution. And again, when we -- as we look out today for the rest of the year and where our share price is today, we just made an assumption that our share price for 3 and 4 will be higher than that strike price. And when you look at that, we'll have to add some equivalent dilution, we'll have to add some shares into our share count. That's going to cost us a couple of pennies.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. So there's warrant dilution in oncology, World Courier and all of that should total, what, $0.06, $0.07, something like that?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, we haven't sized it, but that's the most that we're going to comment. But...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fine.","Tim G. Guttman","Okay.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, my other question is, can you just go back to your -- the oncology reimbursement? Was that sequestration, or was that a specific cut to Medicare B?","Steven H. Collis","John, it was sequestration. So April 1, it's -- and again, I think regulators just don't understand. They say, \"Well, a 2% cut should be manageable.\" It's not a 2% cut because the practices don't have any ability to impact that ASP. That ASP stays fixed. And then, what they have to work with is the -- what was once the 6% over their ASP number, it's now 4% over their ASP number. So it's definitely going to be impactful.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And to be clear, so you're thinking it's not that you're getting less margin yourself, it's just that you're losing some practices to the bigger consolidators because they can't take the...","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Well, in my comments, I said that we -- there has been a trend towards practices selling. Just in cardiology, for example. It was very, very profound. In oncology, it's been a couple -- we've lost a couple of practices a quarter. Many of them selling to other larger practices. In most of the cases, those larger independent and non-U.S. oncology practices are our customers. You've got market share in oncology has always been well known and understood, but we're actually seeing that trend towards practices selling. We think it could be enhanced now or accelerated now because of this additional reimbursement pressure.","Barbara A. Brungess","And now, before we go, Steve would like to make some final comments.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Thank you, everyone, for your attention today. I know we went a bit longer than planned, and we wanted to give you all -- as many of you as possible to ask questions because today's call was certainly more complex than our calls had been historically, and -- but we appreciate your attention and interest in ABC.","[Technical Difficulty]","Steven H. Collis","Okay. Again, so we sincerely appreciate your attention and interest. It is clear that this was a momentous quarter for ABC. And we believe with the various steps we've taken this quarter, including our performance in this quarter, that we've significantly expanded our position in the supply channel and we have an opportunity to continue to create accelerated value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you very much.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. And before we go, I'd just like to highlight a few of our upcoming events. As we noted in our press release, we'll be attending the Bank of America Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 14; the UBS Health Care Conference in New York on May 28; and the Goldman Sachs Health Care Conference in Rancho Palos Verde, California on June 12. That concludes our call for today.","And now, I'll turn it back to the operator. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Financial Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen, and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman President and CEO; Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President, incoming CFO.","On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations provided in today's press release are also available on our website. During this conference call, we will also make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, earnings per share, operating income and income taxes.","Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. We will be updating you on our performance for the year and briefly discussing our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results. Additionally, I will spend some time addressing the current market environment, AmerisourceBergen's positioning and our expectations for fiscal 2019.","Throughout fiscal 2018, our associates executed to deliver solid performance even as two of our business units continue to work through some challenges. I am proud of what we accomplished in this dynamic market, and I want to take a moment to thank our team of 21,000 associates for their dedication and performance. These are talented teams across the globe who help shape our culture, power our ability to execute and drive our growth.","Over the past year, we've had several notable achievements. First, we successfully executed a number of key strategic initiatives that further strengthened and expanded our relationships with key customers. Our team helped enable the seamless integration of more than 1,900 Rite Aid stores acquired by our largest partner, Walgreens. We also continue to grow share of wallet within our existing customer base and successfully renewed key customer contracts, including with a key partner, Humana, and several others, all without creating any margin headwinds.","Next, our continued leadership and performance in specialty distribution remained a key area of strength for AmerisourceBergen. This quarter marked the 19th consecutive period with 10% or greater revenue growth for our specialty distribution businesses, and the first time surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue. We are proud of both this achievement and the ability of our teams to put our customers first, ensuring that patients have access to vital pharmaceuticals whenever and wherever they need them.","Also our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business group, including businesses like World Courier and Xcenda, delivered results above expectations and surprised (04:21) manufacturer innovation across the globe with best-in-class global specialty logistics and market access services. These efforts across AmerisourceBergen helped to deliver strong results. Revenues were up 11% to $43 billion for the quarter, and 10% to $168 billion for the full year. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.45 for the fourth quarter and $6.49 for the full year, an increase of 9% and 10%, respectively, compared to the previous fiscal year period.","Next, I will provide updates on two business units that have dealt with challenges in fiscal 2018. We are pleased with the substantial progress we have made at Lash Group as the business continues to migrate customers to Fusion. Our game-changing technology platform and manufacturer feedback continues to be very positive. In a growing market of new innovative specialty therapies that require additional patient access and adherence services, we believe Lash's focused services enabled by Fusion are a significant differentiator that is positioning Lash for future success.","Now for an update on PharMEDium. As always, patient safety comes first and we continue to communicate with the FDA to ensure they are satisfied that our Memphis facility meets 503B standards prior to commencing commercial distribution. We have made significant progress in Memphis. However, work remains to be done. The progress has certainly taken longer than we expected. However, that is the right approach to take and we have factored in an (06:17) appropriate outlook for PharMEDium in the fiscal 2019 guidance.","Despite the challenges, we believe the long-term outlook for PharMEDium's business and industry demand remains unchanged. In fact, PharMEDium has secured the primary award status for a large health system GPO, reflecting the markets' appreciation for the work we do and the products that we create. We have taken significant measures to ensure that the long-term outcome from this process will be enhanced quality assurance and quality control programs that delivers the safest and highest quality products for our customers.","As we close our review of fiscal 2018, I want to discuss our financial leadership transition. As you all know back in September, we announced that CFO, Tim Guttman, had decided to retire from the company; and that Jim Cleary, our current Group President, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, will succeed Tim as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Throughout his 16 years in the company and nearly seven-year tenure as CFO, Tim has been a key partner to me and the rest of the executive leadership team. He has supported the company, delivering a strong track record of financial results, growth and total shareholder return. All the while, he has exemplified financial stewardship and humble leadership. Please join AmerisourceBergen team and me as we wish the best to our colleague and friend, Tim Guttman.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter financial results.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and I really appreciate your kind words. This morning, consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. For a discussion of our GAAP results, I would ask that you please refer to our earnings release.","I also want to remind everyone that we are consolidating the adjusted financial results of our Brazil investment, Profarma and the specialty joint venture. We have yet to anniversary these consolidations and, as a result, they add some complexity when reviewing our numbers and comparisons. We continue to include a schedule in our earnings release which illustrates the financial impact of the consolidation.","As Steve mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and importantly, we exited fiscal 2018 on a strong footing. Excluding the financial headwind from PharMEDium, our business portfolio executed well. We grew our volumes across the enterprise and we had solid financial results. In the second half of our fiscal 2018, we reported just under $3 in adjusted EPS, delivering on the guidance we provided on our March quarterly earnings call.","With that, we could begin our detailed financial review. I will provide commentary in two main areas. First, I will discuss our September Q4 consolidated and segment performance; and second, I will provide a few brief comments on full year fiscal 2018 performance.","We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.45, an increase of 9%. Let me highlight that Brazil was neutral to our adjusted earnings this quarter. We did lose a few pennies of EPS from two items that I will cover shortly, that were onetime expenses specific to the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment.","Our consolidated revenues were $43.3 billion, up 11%. The growth rate was a solid 10% ex the impact from Brazil. Gross profit increased 6%, or $68 million, to about $1.2 billion. However, when excluding the impact from Brazil, our gross profit would have increased 1%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment contributed most of this increase despite the headwind from PharMEDium. Let me highlight our gross profit growth, ex Brazil, would have been closer to 2% if not for a onetime inventory expense due to damaged, nonreturnable pharmaceutical products at one of our distribution centers.","Operating expenses increased 17%, or $106 million, to $732 million. We had several moving parts within OpEx that caused the large increase. Let me spend a minute working through these items to normalize the growth rate. Brazil contributed just under half of the OpEx dollar increase and drove 8% in our OpEx growth. Additionally, Pharmaceutical Distribution's acquisition of H. D. Smith earlier this fiscal year drove roughly 5% of the OpEx growth. Consequently, our comparable year-over-year OpEx growth rate, ex Brazil and also ex H. D. Smith, would have been a very good 4%. Let me also point out this 4% growth rate included a compensation item related to a year-end 401(k) discretionary match we elected to make.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $432 million, down about 8% from last year. And on a comparative basis, so ex Brazil, we would've been down roughly 9%. As a reminder, on our call last quarter, we specifically discussed the expected PharMEDium headwind in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment for the September quarter since the business had a very good Q4 last year. We will cover PharMEDium in more detail in the segment section.","Overall, Steve and I both mentioned that we were pleased with our execution this quarter, because ex-Brazil and PharMEDium and the two expense items specific to the current September quarter, our operating income growth rate for ABC consolidated as well as our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment would have been in the mid-single-digit range.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense, net, increased by about $8 million. Ex-Brazil, the net increase was $5 million due primarily to debt issued earlier in the year to fund the H. D. Smith acquisition.","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was just about 20% and reflects the positive impact from tax reform and the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Additionally, we completed the year with a higher international income mix than we forecasted due to the strong performance by World Courier and a lower contribution from PharMEDium. This change in income mix had a positive effect on our tax rate.","Our adjusted net income, after backing out the Brazil noncontrolling interest, was $315 million, an increase of 7%, driven mostly by our lower tax rate and corresponding tax expense. This concludes the review of our consolidated results.","Next I will cover our segment results. We can begin with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Total segment revenues were nearly $42 billion, up 11%. The growth rate would have been 10%, ex-Profarma Brazil. This 10% growth rate is mostly due to onboarding new business from our strategic partner Walgreens, growth in our specialty distribution business in the high-teens as a percentage, and integrating H. D. Smith.","Moving to segment operating income. We had a decrease of about 11% to $357 million, the growth rate, ex-Profarma Brazil, was 1% lower at negative 12%. The segment was impacted by lower performance at our PharMEDium business. Ongoing remediation efforts at PharMEDium's Memphis facility caused a significant decline in year-over-year units shipped. We also had lower units shipped from our open PharMEDium facilities as they implemented enhanced quality procedures and testing.","On the surface, the segment operating income results don't probably reflect the solid underlying business performance. We had better-than-expected growth from our key customer groups led by higher volumes, especially in generics and oncology drugs. Margins were in line with what we expected and, overall, we managed our expenses well. It's worth saying one more time the segment would have had a mid-single-digit operating income growth rate, after factoring in the items I highlighted earlier, when discussing ABC's consolidated results.","Before I leave the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, I want to point out that this is the first quarter that we recorded an estimated expense related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act. This expense has been excluded from our adjusted results because the expense is not expected to be recurring. Recently, we changed our operating business model in terms of how we receive opioid prescription drug inventory in our New York distribution centers. This change essentially eliminates our New York opioid tax liability going forward.","We can now move to the other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, which includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. As a reminder, we consolidate our Brazil specialty joint venture in this segment. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up 8%. When excluding the Brazil specialty JV, revenues grew 3%, led by our Canadian operation and, to a lesser extent, World Courier and MWI.","From an operating income standpoint, with Brazil, the segment increased 5%, or $4 million, to $75 million. The segment, ex-Brazil, increased 3%. We are especially pleased with this result as this was the first quarter in fiscal 2018 that the segment had year-over-year growth. MWI led the way while World Courier and our Xcenda businesses also contributed. These three businesses offset the headwind from our Lash Consulting business.","Let me spend a minute on Lash Consulting. We continue to be encouraged by their progress. During the quarter, Lash added another key manufacturer partner to Fusion. This transition to Fusion was the most efficient to date and we received high satisfaction marks from our partner. We are also pleased with the momentum at Lash with new business wins, due in part to manufacturers being keenly interested in Fusion and the system's capabilities and benefits. Looking forward, Lash is positioned well, entering a period with positive outsourcing and market trends.","Wrapping up the Other segment, we are executing well and very optimistic about this group of market-leading businesses and their prospects. This completes our segment review.","I would now like to cover a few full year fiscal 2018 consolidated financial items. To make this review more efficient my comments and comparisons will exclude Brazil.","Revenue. Our full year growth was a solid 9%. Our specialty distribution business had an standing year, finishing with a revenue growth percentage in the mid-teens. When excluding the impact from H. D. Smith and new business from our Walgreens relationship, specifically their acquired Rite Aid pharmacies and PharMerica, our normalized revenue growth would've been just over 5%. Overall, we're pleased with this normalized growth rate as we continue to track above market as a result of our leading customer portfolio and best in class specialty business.","Our adjusted operating income for the year was down about 2%. We would've been closer to flat for the year, ex the items that negatively impacted us in our September quarter. And importantly, our operating income growth rate, ex PharMEDium, would have been in the mid-single-digits.","EPS. our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $6.49, up 10%, primarily due to tax reform, other tax initiatives and solid execution in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, helping to offset the headwind from PharMEDium.","Adjusted free cash flow. As a reminder, our adjusted free cash flow excludes the litigation payment we made in late September which we reserved to fiscal 2017. We had an exceptionally strong cash flow finish in fiscal 2018, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $1.7 billion, just above the guidance range we provided earlier in the year, and more importantly about 120% of our adjusted net income.","We ended the fiscal year with $2.5 billion in total cash, of which $800 million was held offshore. During the quarter, we did elect to repatriate approximately $640 million from our international operations, and we used this cash for general corporate purposes. Going forward, we expect to repatriate international cash on an annual basis, primarily from our Switzerland business, subject to applicable tax laws.","Our full year fiscal 2018 total share repurchase were $639 million. This translated to repurchasing about 3.5% of our share count. We continue to repurchase shares in October, roughly $125 million, to complete our share authorization.","As I wrap up the section, our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders is clear. During the last five years, we returned about $4 billion between regular share repurchases and dividends.","The last topic I want to cover for fiscal 2018 is manufacturer drug pricing. First, brand drug pricing. If you remember at the halfway point in our fiscal year, we had an average brand price increase of about 8%. With the slowdown in price increases during the second half of our fiscal year, we ended right in the middle of our 6% to 7% guidance range.","Now moving to Generics and, specifically, the deflation rate. As a reminder, our range was a negative 7% to negative 9%, calculated using our buy side acquisition cost for generics. We ended the fiscal year just slightly higher than the negative 7%. Let me point out, the deflation rate has remained relatively stable the last couple of months and has improved versus what we experienced last year. Stabilization is hopefully the last phase before easing generic deflation.","As we have said in the past, the lower the deflation rate, the easier the annual hurdle is to overcome. Each percentage improvement on how much generics are deflating is meaningful. This stabilization is a clear positive and something that makes us optimistic looking into the future for generic pricing. This completes our fiscal 2018 review.","Before I turn the call back to Steve, let me make a few personal remarks. As I quickly approach my retirement date from ABC, I want to take a moment to acknowledge several groups of people. First, to my ABC finance and accounting team, certainly best-in-class, thank you for your dedication, expertise and support you have provided to me throughout my time as CFO.","To Steve, our executive leadership team, the terrific ABC associates and, of course, our board, thank you for your partnership and commitment toward enhancing patient access to pharmaceuticals and growing ABC together.","And last, but certainly not least, thank you to the sell side and buy side. I've enjoyed getting to know everyone and having conversations, many times passionate, about ABC's differentiated positioning, and the incredible value our industry delivers every day. I am honored and pleased to be handing the CFO reins to Jim, a seasoned and accomplished executive who will help lead the company to new higher levels.","With that, I will turn the call back to Steve to discuss fiscal 2019.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Looking to fiscal 2019 and beyond, AmerisourceBergen will continue to invest, innovate, execute and grow. Even with challenges from PharMEDium, we expect our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.95, representing mid-single-digit percentage growth.","Our pharmaceutical-centric focus, unique portfolio of customers and businesses, differentiated customer experience and leadership in specialty position AmerisourceBergen for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. While there may be periods of uncertainty within the broad marketplace, we are confident in our ability to execute even as the company navigates through what continues to be an ever-evolving healthcare landscape.","Healthcare remains a critical, integral part of the economy and pharmaceuticals represent the most efficient form of patient care. They not only improve patient lives but are also key to mitigate overall healthcare spend. Right now, many debates regarding the U.S. healthcare system are taking place at a headline level, with the cost of care and the price of prescription drugs drawing focus. We realize that the healthcare system will continue to evolve, yet also recognize that significant changes will likely take time.","In this dynamic environment, the scale and scope of AmerisourceBergen's value to its partners and our industry's value to the healthcare system overall continue to be undeniable. Our unique capability to provide logistical services and drive cost efficiency within the supply chain are vital to patient access and care.","As changes to various parts of the current healthcare model are considered, we have an important seat at the table during discussions with policy leaders, manufacturers, customers and other stakeholders to help ensure that changes do not negatively affect patient access to the best care possible and that our important role in the supply chain continues to be recognized. We believe every change offers opportunity, and our overall focus on innovation and efficiency is key to ensuring that any model evolutions reflect the value we provide.","This morning's announcement of the board approval of our new $1 billion share repurchase authorization reinforces our confidence in our value proposition and ability to successfully navigate the industry evolution, and reflects our ongoing commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We will continue to focus on elements we can control, be an advocate for community-based providers, servicing our customer relationships, executing our differentiated strategy, and investing in our businesses. AmerisourceBergen is positioned to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth and is highly differentiated in four key areas.","First, AmerisourceBergen has key long-term anchor partnerships in each segment. Our alignment with these long-term relationships expand our ability to create more value for all of our partners and position us for share growth and success. We are extremely proud of the position we are in with our customers, with no major contract renewals on the horizon.","Manufacturers are a key customer segment who understand the value they capture in driving patient access to products through strategic partnerships with AmerisourceBergen. As a vital connection between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, AmerisourceBergen continues to enhance our value proposition to manufacturers through services, data and analytics that deliver additional value by helping manufacturers maximize patient access to therapy.","On the other end of the supply chain, AmerisourceBergen continues to support the viability and growth of community-based providers, including independent pharmacies; specialty practices, such as community oncology and veterinary practices. Consumers seek care in their local community where there is a hospital, a clinic or a pharmacy, and accessibility of these healthcare professionals is vital.","We want to make sure that we're enabling the local healthcare destinations to better (27:41) serve the people and the animals in their communities, providing access to expertise in medicine when and where the patients need it. AmerisourceBergen will continue its unwavering commitment to supporting community-based providers, enabling to use their time to focus on patient care and enhancing their ability to maximize business performance.","Second, our leadership position in specialty. The fastest growing part of the pharmaceutical market places AmerisourceBergen at the forefront of successful commercialization and distribution of specialty products. Over the last several decades, we've made many strategic organic and inorganic investments (28:24) comprehensive portfolio of global commercialization and distribution services that supports enhanced access for an increasing number of new, innovative therapies coming to market.","We continue to have the most extensive footprint in specialty, leveraging our strength and scale to serve as the key connections between manufacturers and physicians and, ultimately, patients. The growth of complex specialty medications is also driving an increased demand for commercialization services.","AmerisourceBergen continues to be well positioned to meet this growing need by having made ourselves the essential partner for manufacturers throughout the pharmaceutical commercialization process. As a differentiated partner with market-leading data and technology platforms and solutions, we are improving efficiency, driving data connectivity, generating insights and enabling manufacturers to enhance outcomes for patients and businesses.","Third, innovation is fundamental at AmerisourceBergen. Our differentiated portfolio of services and solutions unlocks new value for manufacturers and provider customers. Our highly automated distribution network and key IT systems enable the successful navigation of a complex supply chain while maintaining product safety and security. We remain committed to delivering a best-in-class customer experience through the design of new solutions that transform the customer's experience to become more integrated, seamless, personalized and informative, empowering providers to spend more time on patient care.","For example, our ABC Order technology, designed by pharmacists for pharmacists, continues to help providers operate more effectively and efficiently, giving us differentiated value and high customer satisfaction scores, we recently expanded and launched ABC Order to support our health systems customers, helping them improve inventory control efficiency, optimize ordering decisions and access data trends and insights.","Finally, AmerisourceBergen has a proven track record of successful financial stewardship. Our company continues to have a strong balance sheet and a thoughtful and disciplined approach to capital deployment that includes investments to drive organic growth, through valuation consideration or (31:02) value-creating strategic M&A opportunities, share repurchases and a reasonable dividend for our shareholders.","This October, we completed our previous share repurchase authorization, following the execution of opportunistic repurchases. This morning's share repurchase authorization announcement and increase in our dividend reflects our balanced approach to capital deployment and ongoing commitment to returning shareholder capital.","In closing, I feel fortunate that in this financial leadership transition, we are able to have such an experienced executive, as Jim, take on the role of CFO of AmerisourceBergen. Jim brings more than 20 years of strong leadership and operational experience and an in-depth knowledge of our business to this new role. His proven track record of management and execution make him an excellent leader to help AmerisourceBergen continue to grow as the leading healthcare solutions provider and drive shareholder return.","Over the last several years working with Jim, I've come to know him well personally and professionally, and respect and value his leadership experience, dedication to our associates, and as many of you in the investment community already know, his commitment in delivering value to shareholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim, who will discuss our financial guidelines for fiscal 2019. Jim?","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I start my commentary on our fiscal 2019 guidance, I want to take a moment to thank Tim, not only for his support during this transition process, but also for having developed such a deep talented financial team to support me in my new role as CFO. I certainly have big shoes to fill and appreciate Tim's guidance throughout this process.","During my time as CEO of MWI Veterinary Supply, I valued my engagement with the investment community and I look forward to working with all of you now as CFO of AmerisourceBergen. Throughout my time here at AmerisourceBergen, most recently leading our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, I've gotten to work with so many great associates, understand in detail the complex services and solutions we provide our partners, and fully appreciate our incredible value proposition for our manufacturer and provider partners.","Now turning to some of our working assumptions that are factored into our fiscal 2019 expectations. First, brand pricing. We assume that brand inflation will be in the mid-single-digits. We believe this range is within reason based on historical pricing practices. For AmerisourceBergen, the broad level of brand inflation is not as important as it once was due to our successful transition of our brand compensation to fee-for-service arrangement. 95% of our brand buy side compensation is now covered by fee-for-service.","However, there are a select number of manufacturers that have not transitioned to fee-for-service. And for that group, our compensation for distribution services rendered throughout the year are realized as part of their pricing activity. If the economics we receive on the products from that subset of manufacturers were impacted, we would go back and renegotiate to ensure that we receive fair compensation for the services we provide.","Now, on the generic pricing front. We've been encouraged by recent manufacturer commentary regarding portfolio rationalization and the observed trend of manufacturers not launching their ANDA-approved generics in markets that have sufficient supply. As we look ahead into fiscal 2019, we are anticipating a generic pricing environment similar to the one that we experienced at the tail end of fiscal 2018.","Given the positive stability and improvement we've seen in generic deflation, we will no longer break it out as a separate line item that we guide to and regularly update. This trend of stabilization is certainly a positive for margins and cash flow and we are hopeful that this is the beginning stages of the normalization of deflation.","Turning now to the specific guidance metrics for our fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Moving forward, the consolidation of Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil will be included in our guidance. We will continue to have year-over-year comparison distortions until we lap the impact of this consolidation as a result of our incremental investment that was made in January 2018.","Regarding revenue, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range, largely driven by growth within our broad portfolio of customers and multiple strategic partnerships.","Regarding consolidated gross profit. While we do not provide specific guidance on gross profit, there are some considerations to point out. First, we have made great progress on rebalancing customer contracts. The process has been successful as our teams have been able to make the process a win-win for customers as the broader market continues to shift to include more specialty products.","Second, our sourcing team is ensuring that we are staying competitive and procuring generics. Third, our leadership in the high-growth specialty distribution business continues to differentiate AmerisourceBergen. And fourth, our leadership and growth in higher-margin Commercialization Services and Animal Health businesses are positives for our overall margin profile. These gross profit benefits will be partly offset in fiscal 2019 by lower volumes at PharMEDium, certainly in the first half of the year and potentially for the year overall, which I will cover later in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment section.","Regarding consolidated operating expenses. We expect consolidated operating expenses to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range due to the consolidation of Brazil and the impact of an additional quarter of H. D. Smith. However, we will almost certainly finish at the very high end of this range.","We have been thoughtful in the integration of H. D. Smith to ensure that there is no impact to customer experience or service levels. We have had excellent customer retention and the integration of this business has gone phenomenally well, and there is a clear cultural fit. As we move further into fiscal 2019, we will begin to capture more H. D. Smith synergies and fully expect to hit our run rate accretion target on time in fiscal 2020.","If you were to normalize for the impacts of the consolidation of Brazil and the elevated expenses related to H. D. Smith, our operating expense growth would be toward the lower end of mid-single-digits. As always, our commitment is to remain diligent in investing and spending, focused on achieving the right benefits and returns while never sacrificing customer experience.","Now I will turn to consolidated operating income. We expect to grow operating income in the low to mid-single-digit percent range, helped this year by a return to growth by both of our operating segments.","From a segment standpoint, we expect the following. In Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, while PharMEDium's Memphis facility remains closed, we're working through the timing of this facility's reopening. We are incorporating a wide range for the segment's operating income growth and currently expect the segment's operating income to grow in the low single to mid-single-digit percent range. Without the potential headwinds from PharMEDium, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment would be growing solidly in the mid-single-digits.","It's worth noting that we've been working through remediation at the Memphis facility. We've also been implementing similar enhanced processes at our other three PharMEDium facilities while continuing to operate them. There's some production limitations at those facilities during this implementation period.","On a more positive note, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continues to benefit from our leadership in specialty distribution, as we provide key services for our customers in the fast-growing part of the market. Our strategic positioning in the specialty market is a clear differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. Additionally, the segment continues to benefit from having anchor customers under longer term contracts with no large renewals in fiscal 2019.","Moving on to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health. We are excited to see this group return to growth in fiscal 2019. We project that this group that helps differentiate AmerisourceBergen will grow operating income in the high single-digit percent range in fiscal 2019. World Courier is carrying its strong growth from 2018 into 2019, and MWI picked up strong momentum in the fourth quarter through the execution of margin initiatives and continued strengthening of its customer relationships and commercial partnerships.","This group's strong growth reflects the team's ability to unlock value and meet the growing demand for services to support specialty products and animal health, even as Lash is migrating customers to the Fusion platform. We are extremely excited by the work being done at World Courier, MWI, and our other consulting businesses to drive this great growth expectation, and we look forward to Lash returning to its normal level of growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond.","Regarding interest expense. While we do not provide specific guidance on interest expense, I will highlight that the consolidation of Brazil and a full year with the debt issued to fund the H.D. Smith acquisition will cause our interest expense to be up about 7% year-over-year.","Moving to our consolidated tax rate expectation. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of about 21% to 22%. While we do get the benefit of one additional quarter at the new U.S. corporate tax rate this year, fiscal 2018 tax rate benefited from a certain level of employee stock option exercises and some discrete onetime items, all of which we do not expect to repeat.","Regarding share repurchases, as Tim detailed, we repurchased over $750 million of AmerisourceBergen shares, if you look at the entirety of fiscal 2018 in combination with the buying activity that we had in the month of October. This opportunistic share buyback represents a significant return of capital to our shareholders. Our fiscal 2019 guidance assumes that our share count will pick up a bit throughout the year due to employee stock option exercises, and we expect to finish the year at around 216 million weighted-average shares outstanding.","Moving to earnings per share. We expect our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.95, reflecting growth of 2% to 7%. Rather than providing a point in time deadline for the reopening and ramp of production at PharMEDium's Memphis facility as we did last year, we believe it is appropriate to incorporate into guidance a range of three scenarios at PharMEDium.","First, the business being a tailwind; second, its contribution being flat compared to fiscal 2018; and third, a scenario that includes a lengthy delay in the opening of the Memphis facility, causing a sizable headwind from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will provide some incremental color to help explain the cadence of our EPS progression. Our fiscal first quarter of 2019 will likely be down slightly year-over-year as we lap a strong first quarter for PharMEDium in fiscal 2018. EPS growth will improve in the second quarter, but overall, we expect our second half EPS growth will be much better than our first half EPS growth.","Moving to cash flow expectations. First, CapEx is expected to be about $300 million. Over half of this CapEx spend relates to key projects that are being carried over from fiscal 2018, including strategic technology investment like the expanded rollout of ABC Order, our customer order entry system; Lash's Fusion; and World Courier's new logistics system, NOVA.","Additionally, as a result of our transformation efforts to further improve efficiency, we have decided to make the investment in bringing our Specialty Distribution group onto the SAP platform, which is a multiyear project with significant benefits, including enhanced customer experience.","Now for free cash flow, we expect our free cash flow for fiscal 2019 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. This cash generation level is impressive, given that fiscal 2019 ends on a Monday, which is our worst cash day. As always, sales mix between specialty, brand and generic products, each of which have distinct cash conversion metrics, is a driver that can move us within this range.","In closing, I look forward to taking on my new role as CFO of AmerisourceBergen. And as investors, you can continue to expect us to be focused on being strong stewards of capital. We are well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and drive value for our shareholders in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Steve for some closing remarks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Jim. Before we proceed with Q&A, I would like to share a few final remarks. AmerisourceBergen continues to execute and drive long-term growth in a highly complex dynamic healthcare environment. Every day, our teams collaborate and apply their expertise towards opportunities that serve our manufacturer and provider customers in more efficient and integrated ways.","As a discussion of different healthcare system models continues, AmerisourceBergen will continue to be a thought leader, engaging with policymakers and commercial partners to ensure that we are a driver of solutions, enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a part of the solution and supportive of the most cost-efficient form and sites (47:55) of patient care.","Our differentiated strategy and ability to execute strongly position AmerisourceBergen for long-term growth. We think, plan and act strategically to improve efficiency, support partner growth, champion patient access and build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. More than ever, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. As always, we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen.","I will now turn it over to Bennett to start our Q&A.","Bennett S. Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Given the length of management's remarks this morning, we will be extending the call past one hour to be used for additional Q&A. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First question is from the line of Steven Valiquette, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Steve and Jim. And also, Tim, just wanted to say I definitely enjoyed our interactions over the years and best of luck in future endeavors.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. I really appreciate it.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. My quick question here really is just curious as we think about PharMEDium and your potential future revenue run rates, just curious, has the industry growth stayed pretty robust for these products and services in 2018 and 2019 while you're partially out in the market? And then, again, do you think you're still maintaining good relationships with customers today during this longer closure process, or is it possible the longer it takes to resolve these issues, there could be a little bit of slippage on the prior volume? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, Steve. Yeah, thanks for the question. It's Steve Collis here, of course. And, yeah, we're very disappointed with where we find ourselves with PharMEDium as we know you all are. Memphis does remain closed. And I think it's important for you all to recall that we're already focused on the long term here. And in the long term, we committed to a healthy bilateral relationship with regulators. That's going to be key here. And being at the highest end of service in this industry, PharMEDium was really such a large participant in the 503B industry and was one of the key drivers for our \u2013 with the new legislation, one of the key drivers for our decision to invest in the company.","We focus right now on demonstrating the commitment to the FDA to the highest standards of regulatory compliance and patient safety, and that's going to be our priority. We think that the customers are being very supportive. We announced a major award as customers do look towards the future. However, we recognize that customers are frustrated also. So it's hard to gauge exactly how the market will respond when we are ready, particularly as we don't have a firm start date and that's the frustration right now, and it has our full attention.","But I'll just end by saying that it's important to keep in the context of the overall progress in AmerisourceBergen and great results that we feel we reported in a very difficult market in fiscal 2018 and a relatively strong outlook for both segments, excluding PharMEDium, which we know investors kind of actually look at it like that (51:30) but it is probably helpful to you to see the strong trends that we have in the rest of our business. And we'll take the next question \u2013 or Jim \u2013 sorry, Jim wants to say something as well.","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, just, Steve, following up on your comments, we're committed to not restart commercial operations pending further FDA feedback. And of course, our priority is to demonstrate to the FDA our commitment to patient safety and compliance practices. But in addressing your question, we really do feel that there's compelling patient need and significant market demand for safe and effective compounded sterile preparation products, and we remain committed to being the market leader, PharMEDium remains committed to being the market leader in quality and the trusted partner to customers. So of course, right now, though, our priority remains patient safety and we're dedicated to achieving full regulatory compliance.","Operator","And next question's from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And, yeah, Tim, let me just echo that sentiment. It's been a pleasure working with you. Best of luck.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And I'm sure you'll get a few more on this, but I did want to stick with PharMEDium. I guess last quarter, you guys obviously seemed very confident that you'd be able to resume production by the time we got to fiscal 2019. Obviously, today, it sounds like we're not quite there yet. I was just wondering maybe what changed with the ongoing discussions with the FDA that has you rethinking the timeline, and then how should we think about that relative to guidance.","And then if I could just sneak in a follow-up related to that, the 8-K today obviously mentions the DOJ, which is a new element. I'm just wondering if you could also share how they now factor into this process. Thanks.","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. And so we're committed to working with the FDA and working closely with them and not restarting operations pending their further feedback. And so we'll be actively working with them.","And then with regard to how it really plays into guidance, and I want to echo something Steve said that as we look at fiscal year 2019, our portfolio of businesses is performing well, but of course, as we talked about today, we do have this PharMEDium issue. And so we've looked at it in three different scenarios in the guidance, as we said. First is the potential of it being a tailwind. Second is the contribution being flat to fiscal 2018. And then there's a third scenario that includes a lengthy delay of the opening of the Memphis facility causing a sizable headwind from PharMEDium.","And let me kind of talk about it with regards to operating income at the Pharmaceutical Distribution group. We've said that the Pharmaceutical Distribution group will have operating income in the low to mid-single-digits. And at the lower end of this range, without the PharMEDium impact, we would be solidly in the mid-single-digits for Pharmaceutical Distribution. And so the potential PharMEDium impact at the lower end of the range is kind of this 2% to 3% impact on operating income growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question's from the line of Charles Rhyee, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Sorry, I just wanted to stay on PharMEDium one more time, just to follow up on Jim's comments there. So you're kind of suggesting that if we look at 2% to 3% of growth being from PharMEDium, kind of sounds like that's like $0.15, $0.20, which sounds like \u2013 can you kind of describe for me within what else in the range, certainly relative to where I think the Street expectations were coming into today for fiscal 2019, maybe kind of go over some of the other headwinds I guess that could be affecting the growth as we think about this year.","And I know it's early and we're just talking about 2019 now, but what would you kind of think about sort of the more sustainable long-term growth rate once, let's say, PharMEDium is sort of back on a normalized run rate growth? Thanks.","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, so let me talk a little bit about what moves us within the guidance range. And as we've said earlier, the biggest thing that moves us within the guidance range is PharMEDium and the Memphis reopening and the production ramp. But the other things that really move us within the guidance range are business unit performance and, as we've said before, the portfolio of businesses is performing well and we expect it to perform well in fiscal year 2019.","H. D. Smith synergies move us within the guidance range, management of our operating expenses, our expectations on generics deflation and branded inflation and then the mix between brand, generic and specialty. Those are kind of the numerous things that move us within the guidance range. But then really kind of the biggest thing that's moved us within the guidance range is PharMEDium and any kind of timing with regard to Memphis reopening and production ramps.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. And on the long-term model, maybe just add, we feel confident on long term, we really mean over the long term, and ABC's approached this with a long-term perspective as we do all of our businesses. And we would say growth with the market, which is again, prescription demand continues to surge, new product innovation, we're very well placed with our anchor customers. Our specialty business is a differentiator. Our Commercialization Services and Animal Health, we have robust growth next year in 2019, and we think that those will carry on being differentiators for us. We've been excellent stewards of our capital. We have a active shareholder return policy.","So we feel really good about our business in the long term. And we also feel that if you isolate the PharMEDium issue, we are competing very well in the competitive landscape that we're in. And we do have differentiation. We have so many businesses this year, Charles, that have performed really well. We try to point out our specialty distribution to physician businesses and the incredible results they posted, but also businesses like Xcenda and World Courier and our Innomar business Canada have really, really performed very well.","So I think ABC has got a complex and, overall, very well performing portfolio. MWI had a really strong fourth quarter. We were thrilled that their fourth quarter, they came in ahead of expectations. So there's a lot to be optimistic about at AmerisourceBergen.","Next question.","Bennett S. Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Next question.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. A two-part question here. You mentioned you were encouraged by the portfolio rationalization across some generic manufacturers. Do you think we're in a time period where you have greater visibility on the generic pricing environment? And then separately from a regulatory perspective, I guess how should we think about the potential implications of Part B drugs moving to Part D, as well as other concepts such as specialty, step therapy, for instance, across your specialty business? How should we think about the impact of some of those proposals and what you're paying most attention to from a regulatory perspective? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We're pointing out that generic deflation is sort of in the range of what we've come to expect and more what's normal. We expect fiscal year 2019 to be similar to the tail end of fiscal year 2018, and we're optimistic that, in the long run, we'll return to single digits. The stabilization is obviously, we pointed out, is good for not only our generic business, which is very important to us, but also for the cash flow. Those are some of our highest return cash flow businesses.","On the Trump proposal to changes to Part B, we remain incredibly committed to the community setting. It's an active setting, it's shown great growth this year. It's an active marketplace. And we think that the access to those lifesaving therapies and to community practitioners is very important to patients. There's no data we've been able to show that says that that setting is more expensive or that physicians prescribe based on economics. We think that they prescribe based on the highest standards of therapy and protocol management.","And we really are committed to seeing that those patients have access to care in their communities and particularly when you look at rural communities and the job that rural community oncologists perform, it's really quite moving. And to think that those community physicians could be threatened is obviously not something that we think regulators or CMS wants to encourage in any way.","So we think that there'll be a rational debate and we also feel that there are people in DC and at CMS and HHS that understand these issues and that we can engage with and dialogue with them. We are doing that.","Operator","And next question's from the line of George Hill, RBC. Please go ahead.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. And I want to say, Tim, on a personal and professional level, sad to see you go. And, Jim, welcome to the call.","I guess, my question is on the brand or pricing environment, where we're seeing the launch of generic introductions of higher priced specialty drugs and price cuts for expensive brand drugs. I know that you guys have taken an aggressive approach to biosimilars and specialty drugs in the past. In your discussions with manufacturers, do you guys think you're going to be able to keep unit economics the same in the face of some of these price cuts for brand drugs and these authorized generic launches?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, it's a good question, George. Look, the market is dynamic. I'll just reiterate that ABC is confident in our value proposition. We're confident that the economics that we receive are fair. It's also always important to remember that we have both buy and sell side economics and we have flexibility in how we price contracts.","I think that some of these trends are very interesting and we discuss this at length in our business reviews, what should our strategy be with the manufacturers. And there's all sorts of strategies being deployed, there's not necessarily one, in terms of what the reimbursement codes are, in terms of is the brand product being taken out of the market and we have this quasi-biosimilar-type product. Everyone's adopting different strategies.","What we are sure about is that AmerisourceBergen is a valued partner by all those manufacturers. We've been engaged at the highest levels in those launches and participated actively and supported our partner strategy in the marketplace. And there's no doubt that there's a drive towards greater transparency in the marketplace. And we think some of those trends, as they benefit the overall system and as they benefit patients, will benefit AmerisourceBergen as well and we're very confident that we will participate actively in those therapies and in those price changes as the market adapts.","Next question, please","Operator","Next question, Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. You guys have talked in the past about your efforts to implement differential pricing strategies across different product types. Just wondering if you could sort of update us on your efforts there and sort of what inning you'd say we're at with respect to that.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","So...","Bennett S. Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Sorry, can you actually repeat that question?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that. Sorry, Michael, if you could... (01:04:34)","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, sure. Just with respect to you guys have previously talked about efforts to implement differential pricing strategies across different pharma product types, and I guess where do you stand with that process and sort of what inning are you at?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, so, we've been very successful with our rebalancing. I mean, if you look \u2013 obviously, we went to the biggest customers first and we've been \u2013 so those have been taken care of. And as large customers came up, we've had the discussion. I think on the sell side, Michael, we've been happy with the way we've been able to renew contracts and have that rebalancing discussion.","Look, the larger customers definitely understand this. I mean, some of the trends are very discernible in terms of the growth of specialty, generic deflation, et cetera, the new therapies, the innovative therapies, live-cell therapies. So, we've been able to have these discussions. And, look, like everything we do, it's much more complex, right? And the categories or brand are not just brand and generic; it's biosimilars, it's cell therapies, it's specialty drugs, it's mature or solid (01:05:41) products.","So, we have been able \u2013 we're having discussions. And, frankly, there is much more complexity in our contracting. We're well over halfway through that, because our average contracts are anywhere from three to six years or so. Some are longer, but that's the general range. So, they are making some that haven't come up. But the most strategic and essential customers around, (01:06:06) we are in discussions with them constantly about down to even some key product launches.","So, this is not work that's once and done. It's iterative and continues, literally, almost, on some cases, on a weekly basis, you could say, with key customers. And we had some very large customers, of course, we talk a lot about Walgreens, but there's also big customers like Kaiser and Express Scripts and CPA, and in the vet business Banfield, and Florida Cancer, and our community oncology business, we literally are having constant discussions. AmerisourceBergen is very customer and market-facing, so we are accessible to customers and we have these discussions constantly. Jim or Tim, anything you'd like to add?","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, Steve, I'll add. And I'll say as I start in this role, there's really kind of two things that kind of gave me the confidence to take on this role. One is the phenomenal team that Tim has built up, and second really gets to your question and that's the confidence that I have in our value proposition, both on the buy side, and on the sell side. And as we look at traditional products or new products, one thing I come back to is the cost to replace our services would be significantly higher than the fees that we capture, given the efficiency of our business. So as we look at new products, whether it be biosimilars or other sorts of things, pricing does become more complex, but we come back to the fact that we've got confidence in our value propositions.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. And Steve, if you don't mind, I'm kind of itching to answer a question.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","So \u2013 no, just look at our track record, I mean we've had several announcements of large contracts that we've renewed the last couple of years. And we've called out no margin headwinds, so again, I think that's proof that we're making progress in the market. And we continue to move the initiative forward in terms of repricing. That's what we're committed to.","Bennett S. Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next is Eric Percher, Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. You mentioned that your assumption for brand price inflation is mid-single-digits and that is consistent with historic practice. How does that sit relative to the conversations you're having with manufacturers, particularly that 5% that are not fee-for-service, but also the entire book as you think about what occurs beginning January 1?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Eric, thanks for the question. Look, there's no doubt we're going to be \u2013 and, of course, we have a certain conference that we'll be attending very early in January, so there's no doubt that we're going to be very intrigued by what happens in the marketplace. But it is, as we said, it's really those select group of manufacturers that we are still \u2013 that price inflation is a part of the overall economics we receive.","Look, if they were to not have price increases, we would absolutely have a discussion. We think that that's a fair and balanced discussion to have. We don't think that inflation should be a part of the overall compensation we receive or an important part of it. And there are other elements, of course, to the compensation we receive from those manufacturers.","But we are going to be very interested, as I'm sure you will be, to see what happens in January and what the environment is. There's no doubt that anything beyond to (01:09:48) maybe 7%, 8% price inflation increase would be surprising in this environment.","Bennett S. Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question's from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning, and thank you for getting me on the call. And, Tim, best of luck, enjoyed very much working with you.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Likewise, Ricky.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So my question relates to opioids. Just trying to better understand why you think that we shouldn't think about the Opioid expense as a recurring one? And that's one. And second of all, should we think about New York as a proxy when we think about relative potential impact from opioids in other states?","James Francis Cleary - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. So we expect that the expenses for 2017 and 2018 that we've experienced in New York related to the Opioid Stewardship Act are not expected to be normal, and so that's why they're excluded from our adjusted results. And what we've done is we've adjusted our Pharmaceutical Distribution logistics for New York, which will substantially eliminate these expenses going forward.","And with regard to other states, it's really too early for us to comment on what might happen in other states, Ricky.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, so I think, Ricky, we're going to end there and let me just make some closing remarks. So we obviously have \u2013 we wish that we had better news to share with you on PharMEDium but I just want to end by reemphasizing that ABC is strongly positioned going forward. We have a differentiated policy, a differentiated strategies around specialty and around our commercialization business.","We feel that we are very aligned and very in sync with key customers when it comes to key trends. We have been strong stewards of capital and we are growing in fiscal year 2019, it just depends how PharMEDium performs. And please recognize that we are not entirely in control of when Memphis will be restarted and when the other operations will be able to resume, but clearly, there's been a delay in what we had originally communicated to you on the last conference.","So again, thank you for your time and let me just say one more time that we are very pleased with ABC's positioning in our marketplace and our differentiated policies around specialty and commercialization. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining.

I am Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen.

We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and increase as we can within the hour.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven Collis","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone.","I am pleased to discuss our first quarter results and the improved outlook and financial guidance we are providing for fiscal year 2017. Our broad portfolio of businesses performed in line or above our expectations for the quarter. Revenues were up 4% to $38.2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS grew more than 7% compared to the previous fiscal year positioning us to meet our fiscal 2017 objectives.","While they have been challenges and headwinds, we continue to see U.S. Pharmaceutical sector growth and resilience driven by patient demographics, a strengthening U.S. economy, a robust pipeline of new brand drug launches, and an increasing focus on value and outcomes.","Brand pricing actions taken earlier this month reinforce the stability of that market but also underscore the careful consideration that manufacturers are putting into their pricing strategies in the current environment. Today I think that all of us in the industry have the opportunity and the responsibility to enhance patient access, drive efficiency and ultimately reduce overall healthcare costs while creating value.","At AmerisourceBergen we take this responsibility seriously and all we believe uniquely positioned to realize the opportunity. Our customer base, leadership position in specialty products, innovative approach to services and solutions, and strong history of financial stewardship all position us to outpace the market's projected growth in coming years.","Now I'd like to discuss our key differentiators and how they helped AmerisourceBergen and our Associates deliver a strong first quarter. First, we believe we have the best customer base in the business. Our broad and diversified portfolio of growing customers across all of our businesses performed well in the first quarter. We enjoyed long-standing collaborative relationships with our anchor customers and they continue to outperform.","Walgreens Boots Alliance remains strong and aligned partner and we look forward to continuing to expand our opportunities to deliver value. Additionally we continue to make progress in our efforts to strengthen our customer relationships, expand within our existing customer base and evolve our contracts and pricing strategies for brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions.","Customers understand this and are open to finding mutually beneficial solutions. We are working with them to do so. Ultimately we believe that we the strongest customer base in the industry and our objective is to create customers for life. The strength of our business is reinforced about a high quality of our customers, and our ability to develop long-term collaborative partnerships with them. We are here to support the innovation and together to advance and enhance patient care.","Second, our leadership position in specialty products puts AmerisourceBergen at the full front of a rapidly growing market segment. When we refer to outstanding specialty products, it's important to note our market-leading position in both full-line distribution, as well as specialty distribution. This quarter we are pleased to see continued growth of specialty products available through full-line distribution affirming the value and efficiency of the prime vendor model for our customers including hospitals, health systems and community pharmacies.","We once again had a great quarter across our specialty business with very strong results. Our specialty distribution business revenue grew double digits year-over-year with strong contribution primarily from oncology and community oncology solutions. Our market-leading patient services Biopharma consulting business and clinical trial logistics business also continue to make important contributions in supporting existing and newly launched specialty products.","In the quarter AmerisourceBergen continue to be selected as the pharmaceutical services partner for a wide range of new specialty products with access to both full-line distribution and specialty distribution further establishing our leadership in this area. We've also expanded patient access to new biosimilar products recently completing negotiations with key pharmaceutical manufacturers for this differentiated new product category.","One example of how leadership in this specialty arena is helping drive patient access is our assessment of the risk to community oncology care and patient access inherent in the part B demonstration project and our ability to mobilize and support of our customers and patients.","As I believe you all know proposed Part D payment model was not finalized by CMS late last year, and will likely not be reintroduced by the new administration. There were many concerns about what the proposed model would mean for physicians, patient access to critical medications and overall medical care. AmerisourceBergen was a vocal opponent of the proposed model and I\u2019m very proud of the work we did in Washington to voice the industry concerns and educate key agencies and law makers.","With our market-leading franchises and ability to provide an integrated commercialization service offering AmerisourceBergen is the global leader in the distribution and support of specialty drugs across a wide spectrum of channels. We are proud of our trusted partner status in close collaboration with manufacturers and providers to ensure patient access to all types of specialty products.","Third, AmerisourceBergen's innovative approach to services and solutions is driving our customers' growth. We continue to execute and succeed within a challenging healthcare landscape by offering our customers the most innovative and business-critical solutions needed to drive the growth. The customer responses to our services and enhanced offerings has been extremely positive. We believe our strategic services and solutions are enabling us to grow within our existing customer base. We do this while carefully controlling costs and always taking a thoughtful and measured approach to capital expenditures.","For example, we're making smart significant investments in and improvements to our ERP systems and customer solutions. Offerings and initiatives like Good Neighbor Pharmacy and our Elevate Provider Network continue to add value and build on the integrated suite of services of resources available to independent pharmacies ultimately helping them grow. Elevate's core capabilities enable Independents to better engage with payors and patients to drive improved adherence and easily accessed data to support faster, more accurate reimbursements, two, critical needs for these community pharmacy customers.","We are also about to fully rollout our ABC order program as state-of-the-art e-commerce system designed by pharmacies for pharmacists that provide the intuitive tools to order effortlessly, manage inventory, access data and information and resolve any issues quickly. Additionally our improved First to Shelf program for new generics products has helped us service community pharmacies and ensure competitiveness in the local markets. We executed flawlessly and expanded patient access with several new generic launches in the first quarter.","We've also seen continued growth and market leading service levels of PRO Generics, our proprietary generics formulary. We will continue to look for ways to protect and enhance the role of community pharmacies so that they can continue to service the healthcare needs of millions of patients.","We're making great progress on our capital enhancements and enhance systems. To better positions our sales for the future and engage with our customers, we are building new state-of-the-art distribution centers which are expected to be fully online by the end of fiscal year 2017. These distribution centers incorporate best-in-class technology and our continuous improvement processes to help us deliver on our commitment to provide an exceptional customer experience.","We are also building out systems to better support our Lash Group Commercialization Services, World Courier Logistic business and our overall IT infrastructure. You can expect that we will continue to invest in data solutions analytics and internal and customer facing our key capabilities. We believe that AmerisourceBergen is the trusted data company in our industry and we want to continue to build on our information technology security and innovation to accelerate customer and growth in today's marketplace.","And fourth, our strong history of financial stewardship and proven ability to integrate acquired business gives AmerisourceBergen an advantage in driving growth. AmerisourceBergen takes a strategic approach to capital deployments. Over the past five fiscal years, we have returned about $8 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases programs and we have invested more than $7 billion through acquisitions and capital expenditures.","We are proud about our ability to seamlessly integrate our acquired businesses and they continue to exceed our expectations. A driver of that outperformance in our December quarter was a contribution from our recent strategic acquisitions, MWI Animal Health and PharMEDium. In fact MWI operating income and operating margin hit record high levels in the December quarter fueled by organic growth, new product innovations and achievement of sales goals with key manufacturers especially on the companion side of the business.","We believe that MWI is the largest distributor of animal health products as measured by revenues. As we come into 2017, MWI is committed to both providing value to its manufacture partners, as well as providing customers with the most comprehensive product offering in it's history. Just last week I had the pleasure of joining MWI for its national sales meeting which was attended by all MWI's sales associates and manufacturers. I continue to be impressed by MWI's demand creation salesforce and by the businesses ability to successfully grow penetration rates among existing customer which clearly underscores the value of the level of service it provides.","Finally, we continue to approach capital deployment strategically and opportunistically. We think broadly about the future of healthcare and are always evaluating innovative ways we could further diversify and grow AmerisourceBergen through the addition of new best-in-class and market leading businesses.","In summary, our differentiated industry position and continued strategic execution result in a strong quarter and we have an improved outlook for fiscal year 2017. I'll let Tim provide more details here but I'm very pleased with and inspired by the stellar contributions of our 19,000 associates. Their talent and continued commitment to the success of AmerisourceBergen is the key driver of our growth and I'm proud of our collective ability to achieve our quarterly goals and objectives despite a challenging marketplace and segment headwinds.","So thank you to AmerisourceBergen team. As we move further into 2017, we have great confidence in our unique portfolio of integrated services and the significant value we bring to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provided customers. Our consisting execution enables people to access the healthcare products ultimately improving the lives of patients and delivering the long-term value to all of our stakeholders.","Now let me turn the call over to Tim for more in depth look at our quarterly financial results and our updated financial guidance. Tim?","Tim Guttman","Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone.","We're excited to start fiscal 2017 in a positive way. Our results and business fundamentals were better than we expected. Several of our businesses made key contributions to our results this quarter and I will cover these highlights in my prepared remarks. I have two main topics this morning, I will recap our Q1 adjusted results and our revised fiscal '17 outlook. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal '17 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. With let's move to our results.","Revenues were $38.2 billion up 4%, our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and the strength of our ABSG specialty business. Let me highlight that we had one less business day in the current quarter versus the previous year. We also had less of a revenue tailwind this quarter given the slowdown in branded drug inflation from July through December, while still having a meaningful revenue headwind from brand and generic drug conversions.","Our ABC consolidated revenue growth would have been nearly 6% on a comparable basis which means adjusting for the one-day difference in business days. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased by 1% to $1.1 billion and was entirely due to the growth in our other segment. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment was down this quarter with a difficult comparison as we're still cycling through the repricing of two strategic long-term contract renewals which we have discussed in detail the past few quarters and in the current quarter we began to anniversary the acquisition of PharMEDium.","Operating expenses we are very pleased with our progress in managing operating expenses which were virtually flat compared to last year. Our businesses continue to make meaningful progress focusing on their cost structures, ensuring they spend in the right areas and leveraging existing scale and capabilities where we can.","Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $486 million up about $9 million or 2%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.27% down three basis points from the prior year driven mostly by the pharmaceutical distribution segment bringing down six basis points this quarter.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net was about $35 million up some from last year. The increase is due to a combination of slightly higher average borrowings outstanding and also higher interest associated with the build to suit leases we had to capitalize last quarter.","Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 33.1% down some from the prior year as a result of changes in mix of U.S. versus international income. For the quarter our adjusted diluted EPS increased a solid 7% to $1.36 to 7% growth was driven by the outstanding performance in our other segment. The benefit from an improving tax rate and a lower diluted share count.","I will highlight that we did have a couple of pennies of EPS benefit in the current quarter from the favorable timing on manufacturer rebates that we previously expected to earn in our March '17 quarter. This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with pharmaceutical distribution.","Total segment revenues were $36.6 billion up 4% with our drug company growing just under this level. Our core drug business saw a solid growth better than we expected in its retail, customer segment which includes Independent, Walgreens and other chains. Consistent with the past few quarters I should point out that the business continue to have a revenue headwind of about 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C drug sales primarily in our non-retail customer segment. After this current December quarter, the hepatitis C comparables get better and shouldn't be a meaningful revenue headwind going forward.","ABSG which is our specialty business and an overall revenue increase of 10% driven primarily by volume growth. This is the 12th consecutive quarter that ABSG has had top line growth at 10% or more. We continue to see excellent revenue growth in oncology and to a lesser degree in nephrology. Overall the business continues to capitalize on positive pharmaceutical industry trends and we remain a clear leader in this space.","Segment operating income was $374 million and was down 2%. Our ABSG business continued their high level of performance producing strong operating income growth through a disciplined expense management combined with a revenue growth. Our drug company was down year-over-year as anticipated primarily due to the two key customer contract renewals, slightly lower contributions from price appreciation and the impact from generic deflation.","Last year ended December '16 quarter generic deflation wasn't that meaningful. These headwinds were partially offset by a higher contribution from PharMEDium. I'd like to point out that our drug company's performance was better than we expected and the business is building positive momentum from both top line revenue growth and an improving contribution from generics. We are committed to continuous improvement, the drug company has sharpened it's focus on maintaining high customer service levels and implementing leading customer solutions.","As a result we are seeing generic compliance rates gradually improve with customers which translates the higher volumes. We can now move to our other segment which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI Animal Health.","In the December quarter segment revenues were nearly $1.7 billion up just over 5% both consulting and World Courier at growth rate in the high single-digits while MWI's growth was slightly impacted by foreign exchange associated with their U.K. business. MWI continues to see high growth rate in the U.S. companion animal business, that's a percentage in the high single-digits and we are now encouraged as we're starting to see improving growth rate in the production animal side of the business.","From an operating income standpoint this segment had an outstanding quarter with operating income of $112 million and the growth rate of 17%. This marks the first time that the segment has surpassed $100 million in operating income.","As Steve highlighted MWI achieved records in operating income and operating margin. The business has a relentless focus on the customer, a drive to constantly improved capability and terrific expense management.","Wrapping up our consulting business was also a strong contributor to the segments growth this quarter due to a solid revenue growth. They delivered these results while continuing to focus on implementing a business process redesign which includes a new ERP system. This completes our segment review.","I'd like to now cover key working capital and cash flow items. In the December quarter as expected we had a negative free cash flow of $570 million. As we have discussed in the past, we continue to make a working capital investment with our largest customer Walgreens. This investment will continue to be a cash flow headwind into our Q2 '17 when the investment is complete.","When comparing to last year's free cash flow, we also had a sizable positive day of the week cash impact to our Q1 '16 free cash flow. This day of the week impact did not repeat in the current quarter and was a headwind. We ended the quarter with roughly $1.8 billion in cash with $645 million of this amount offshore.","The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks. We purchased $230 million of shares during the quarter and we finished the quarter with $890 million left on our November 2016 share authorization. We're pleased that from late September 2016 through December 2016 we are able to buy back roughly 8 million shares returning over $600 million to our shareholders.","Now let's turn to our updated fiscal '17 expectations. As I mentioned before we are very pleased with our strong Q1 results and we are now raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.72 to $5.92 which reflect growth of 2% to 5% versus last fiscal year.","I will provide guidance comments in four key areas. First, revenues, our previous guidance was 6.5% to 8% revenue growth even with our Q1 '17 ABC consolidated revenue growth of 4%. We believe we will now be at the high end of this range due to two factors that will enable us to ramp our revenues during the course of the fiscal year. One, our drug company's largest customer Walgreens had added new commercial business which will benefit us and two, brand inflation realized in January will be a better revenue tailwind going forward.","The secondary operating expenses given the continued focus by our businesses on managing costs, we are revising our full-year OpEx growth rate to 4.5% to 6%. We expect that our expenses will increase over the course of the fiscal year to support the revenue ramp. Additionally we start to occur incremental costs related to several of our IT and infrastructure investments.","The third area, operating income, we are revising and moving to low end of our guidance up. Our operating income dollar growth will now be flat to up 4% versus fiscal '16. And the last area our adjusted share account. We'd expect our share account to creep up somewhat given that we front-end loaded our share repurchases. We expect modest share repurchase activity in the near-term. Our first priority now is to ensure our free cash flow track as planned in a repaid $600 million debt obligation that matures in May 2017.","As in the past however, we will remain flexible and opportunistic in terms of capital deployment. Let me point out that the rest of our previously communicated fiscal '17 financial guidance for ABC consolidated is unchanged and reaffirmed at this time.","Before I wrap up I'd like to comment on our working assumptions for the pharmaceutical drug pricing environment. I will cover generic drug pricing first. We are not changing our negative 7% to negative 9% generic deflation range for fiscal '17 at this time. After one quarter based on our drug company's generic drug portfolio we are tracking in line with this assumption. As we progress through the year, we'll hopefully have more clarity on generic pricing trends and if needed we will revise our assumption.","Moving to brand drug pricing, we are comfortable with our 7% to 9% brand inflation rate assumption based on the WAC price increases we realized in January. Both the number of brand pricing announcements, and the overall percentage increases were right in line with what we had assumed.","As a reminder we also anticipate that we will have a certain level of brand price increases in the June, July time period. This is clearly an open item given the unpredictability of pricing actions in the high level of scrutiny. This is part of the reason we continue to have a somewhat wider adjusted EPS range.","So in closing a better than expected quarter and a solid start to our fiscal year, as always we continue to deliver outstanding service, solutions and value to our customers each and every day. And at the same time we look to drive operating efficiencies. This is a winning combination that enables AmerisourceBergen to grow and create long-term shareholder value.","Now here's Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri Mattox","Thank you, Tim. As a reminder please limit your questions to one per participants so that we can get through as many of your questions as possible. Samantha, we are ready to begin with the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Tim I wanted to make sure I got the message right on the branded pricing and the gross profit in the pharma segment. So it sounds like branded pricing in the December quarter came in a little bit later than you had expected and I'll wait a little bit on the gross margin but it sounds like January you've seen price increases more in line with your expectation.","So, as we think about the full-year, are you in fact changing the underlying assumptions for gross profit in the pharma segment given the way pricing has played out? And then just on the back of that based on the comments you just made, if you don't see price increases over the summer, are you able to stay within the full year guidance range.","Tim Guttman","Thanks Bob for the question and I'll take them in order. So the first one we did see brand pricing trail off a bit in our first quarter to December quarter. So that was a little bit of a headwind for our core drug business that we were able to cover. So that's true but then we got the January, we saw the price increases relatively in-line with last year in terms of the number of announcements. The percentages were probably a little bit less overall on a kind of weighted average basis but clearly the January price increases were in line with our 7% to 9% assumptions.","So no change there. We're keeping that assumption for the full-year. I think our point in my script was really to say that there is another time period coming June, July. Our guidance still has a certain level of pricing activity in our assumptions and that's an open item but I think with our $0.20 range, I think Steve and I and the management team we're comfortable that if that trailed off a bit in June or July, we would still fall within the range okay but again that's just one item but I would say we feel good that if the brand inflation - again I'll repeat myself as it trails off a bit we can still stay in the range but on probably the lower end.","Robert Jones","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning. Hi guys, congrats on your results. On this topic we're getting some inbound queries regarding your largest customer and just given that you have this long term 10-year contract with your largest customer and the fact that you went through a bit of a repricing with that customer last year. Is there any reason if there that would be another near term renegotiation of those contract terms or should one need opportunity just to see that ABC should be all set with the price hike on that contract for a while now just given the renegotiation last year? Thanks.","Steven Collis","Hi Steve, thanks for your comments. Yes, the latter is our understanding. So yes, it\u2019s a fluid market, things change but there is nothing in our trends and I think if we go back to the deal we did in 2013 essentially we came up with a very good basis for our long-term contract which took into account some of the anticipated changes that we saw coming you know with the faster growth in specialty products but much more effort generic deflation that we may have expected for 2013-2014. But I think the teams were very thoughtful, we spent a lot of time thinking about the way to cross that model and then we have guided the contract just less than a year ago.","So we feel that it's very big but we are in close touch with our colleagues in Chicago and their businesses had a good quarter and we expecting some good organic growth in the back half of the year which is a driver on our revenue for us. And honesty the relationship the actual not only at my level, but at the levels below the daily interactions are strong and consistent and we have one of our most senior sales people that's fulltime on the account that I think he has done terrific job for us.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, that's great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi good morning, and congratulations on the performance in the quarter. I have a couple of follow-up questions here, first of all given the moving parts in guidance. I know you talked about operating expenses being up for the remainder of the year. So when we think about different segments for the other segment obviously very impressive increase in margins, is this new margin levels sustainable going forward that\u2019s question one, then I have a follow-up on that?","Steven Collis","So I\u2019ll start off and then Tim can follow-up. No there may be some seasonality in the other sector in MWI in particular there were some, we called out some forward items some hitting some thresholds on some rebates and that's definitely as we learn more and more about the business so it is our second December quarter that we had MWI's as part of the ABC family. So we become more experiment. There is some seasonality in our Lash business in World Korea so many think you\u2019d add particular on the overall margin.","Tim Guttman","Yes, and I think Steve you hit it, I mean certainly we benefited \u2013 December is always one of the better quarters from MWI as they come down to year end contracts with manufacturers but going forward the consulting business I commented in my script that they will be implementing the new ERP system and they\u2019ll be having some expenses in that area will ramp up a bit in quarters two, three and four.","But it\u2019s a great margin, it\u2019s the margin have been fairly high. But I would say that - this probably isn\u2019t the run rate but probably not that far off I mean it should be a good margin business and all those businesses leverage well.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. So given that if you think about that the performance for distribution segment going forward and in light of your comments around some of the assumptions you're factoring for that second price increase. So first you said that if it trials off a bit, it's still would be comfortable with the loan and this guidance just to clarify that because I think that\u2019s an area we just been getting a lot of questions on is whether - if manufacturers decide to hold off on that second price increase. Even if that happens do you feel comfortable with the difference number in the business at the low end of your guidance range that\u2019s one.","And second of all on generic pricing, I think you said you\u2019re comfortable with the negative 9% so just to clarify is that generic price deflation range includes both the price deflation for the products and any dynamics on the sell side, so is that kind of like in - deflationary number?","Tim Guttman","Let me go back, I mean I think the brand - your brand question is a good one and I think I should clarify. I think I said when I answered Bob's question first, I said it trailed of a bit we would stay in our range and again I think that's important to me. I'm not going to comment if we had zero price increases for the rest of the year and we didn\u2019t see any pricing activities. I mean we\u2019d had to go back and think about that and understand the impact but certainly it trails off a bit we feel comfortable staying in our range on the brand side.","Generic deflation, I mean we've been very consistent on the minus 7% to minus 9%. We've always pegged that off of our acquisition cost of the acquisition cost in our inventory to let people know that that's what we\u2019re seeing in terms of how that price - so how our acquisition cost is changing over period time. We're probably up towards the higher end of that range and so I think I answered your question but again that's how we calculate it\u2019s on our portfolio, our mix of business based on our fiscal year but we still feel good about that minus 7% to minus 9% and as we go through the year we'll update the range.","Keri Mattox","Thanks Ricky. Samantha can we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby","Tim, there was no reference to cash flow in the press release can you just remind us what your targets are for the year there and what maybe the capital expenditure number will be that still taking a little bit higher than where we were. And then just for Steve, just what's the likelihood of deals this year you've been quiet here for a bid are you back out there looking and could that influence your plans to retire the debt that's coming due this year?","Tim Guttman","Thanks Bob I\u2019ll start. Certainly we reaffirmed our guidance and so I mean the guidance for free cash flow was at adjusted net income we're just slightly above, so we\u2019re still on that. I know we had a negative free cash flow in Q1, but the cadence seasonality in our business we should see a nice positive free cash flow in our March quarter somewhat neutral to up a little bit the June quarter and then traditionally our fourth quarter is pretty high in terms of free cash flow.","So that's how we get back to where we need to be for the year. And CapEx I think we said $500 million roughly - that\u2019s reaffirmed and we should be right about that in that range and most of that is the DC work and the ERP system. So both were consistent and both we still feel good about.","Steven Collis","Yes thanks Robin, and then on the M&A front, one of the things about having our portfolios at this difference cadence with all the businesses. So some of our businesses are not particularly M&A oriented I would point you for medium which is such a strong CGMP business and I think that - such strong organic growth trends its really no point to do M&A and such good market share momentum.","MWI I think we\u2019ve done a few small tuck-ins. We\u2019re very active we\u2019ve done some work in the U.K. I think there is some technology there on the production side which is very compelling, very sticky and very innovative as the world moves towards more of a lot feeding top of products animal business and then, some of the practice management technology we have on the companion animal side I think is transferable. So that\u2019s a business for example where we would have a lot of interest.","Specialty we don\u2019t really see that institutional presence in the rest of the world so not that much interest but definitely all of our individual portfolio companies remain active as they close to the market. We Tim and myself and our group with some park are very active, so if we can find other companies that have strong growth dynamics, our leaders in their respective markets, strong management team that's interested in being part of our knowledge reach and partnership culture, you could see us active on that because we do have the flexibility and we do believe that M&A has become a good competence of ABC that we've demonstrated a lot of effectiveness at. Thank you.","Keri Mattox","Thanks Bob. Samantha, can we move on to the next caller please","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citi Resources. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian","Good morning Steve and Tim. Not sure if we\u2019re doing only one question or one plus one follow-up so I\u2019m going to ask two in one and go from there. One is on just a follow-up on generic price deflation maintaining the 7% to 9% range and Tim you made some commentary also on the maybe towards higher end but given what happened - perhaps the volatility of it a year goes in time period from the December and into the March end quarter. Could you just elaborate on any changes in the forecast and methodology that you're using let it be the inputs you use or any changes in methodology or perhaps you're just applying a more conservative take on the same process. But just wanted to see how you're approaching if that gives you confidence this year.","And secondly really comment on taxes. I know it's a very fluid environment in terms of tax reform but if you could specifically comment on border taxes and if - how that would impact a company such as yourself. And should the net tax reform benefit be favorable if the incremental dollars if it's positive would that have a different capital deployment priority or would it be treated equally?","Tim Guttman","I\u2019ll start Garen on the first one back to the generic deflation. We have not changed our methodology or approach. We've been very, very consistent. It's always based on our drug company's portfolio of what they have in inventory, weighted average. It's based on our fiscal year. We do exclude generic items that have not been on the market for longer than one year. So we take the ones that too have higher variability in that first year.","So we've been very consistent and we track it. We look at the methodology and were still coming up in that range of minus 7 to minus 9 and again I said little on the high end right now at the minus 9. That's why we still feel comfortable at this point.","Tax reform, I'm looking at\u2026","Steven Collis","I was in D.C. last week and I think we have a lot of important partners kind of just waiting to see all over the border but I mean it's - that is a lot of basic medical products that take our causes and syringes and bandages that are almost all manufactured overseas. So it could be a very significant increase in them. I was in the board of Medtech Company when we had the medical device tax and it was very significant. It does affect consumer demand. I think we've seen some models outside the U.S. where prescription medication and medical products are excluded from that.","So we really don't know. I mean as far as ABC goes, I think you can see we are proud of our operating margin performance but it was 127 basis points. So there is not much room there to absorb additional taxes. We will be very, very mindful of that and we are very - only really in BluePoint I was the importer of record and it's a couple of dozen products that we do in BluePoint that we would have to think through the ramifications.","But we think our supply partners would be supportive. There was BluePoint for certain reason and we don\u2019t see it as a big risk at all but there is certainly an environmental risk and I\u2019ve heard this described as a most complex area of anticipated legislation that there is.","So something will be very active and I think ABC will participate with trade associations. We'll be very much looking what the manufacturers are thinking. With the couple of manufacturers last week there were big importers of insulin so very significant ramifications for them. You know a lot of the insulin manufacturers are brought back","I think we have to really wait and see with a lot of what's proposed. I would be hopeful about corporate tax reform but again we don\u2019t know any further details and really not worth spending too much time on conjecture.","Garen Sarafian","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Steve, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you're seeing in the biosimilar space the ability to differentiate and I think you used the words new product category. So have you seen the ability to create a new class of trade here and what is the case for SD or traditional distribution versus specialty pharmacy and maybe the last point on that question would be have you begun to work with physician network and been able to drive share and adoption.","Steven Collis","Thanks Eric. I think we've got three products in the market, all of them are very different, even the legislative pathway that one of them have taken is very different. I do believe we've made progress towards saying to our existing brand manufacturers if you launch us - there goes our train - if you launch these products then speak to us, it's a different channel with different services that we can provide be that at Xcenda, be that at Lash, be that at ION and be that at U.S. bio specialty pharmacy, there are lots of different ways that we can help you approach the marketplace.","And lot of the products so far have really been in the health systems arena, so that's a area that we believe we have a lot of strength. But I think the dialogue between the manufacturers is interactive. We have our point of view. I think we've had to change some hearts and minds on what the distributor's role could be in these products. And I think when it comes more into physician marketplace, you'll see manufacturers have a more developed pathway that they really have worked with organizations like ABSG and ION.","So we state that our role would be to enhance there. So definitely a different between a patient administered and practice administered or physician administered products for the way that AmerisourceBergen works as you would know. So thanks, anything else I can get on Eric?","Eric Percher","The idea that in health system marketplace that they are looking for it, they would much rather see it go through the mid through standard distribution but in the physician market you have a lot of value to add and more likely to see it in specialty distribution?","Steven Collis","Yes absolutely. And then in specialty pharmacy that again will be a different market which we will have a different run. Of course we have some many of the specialty pharmacy customers are AmerisourceBergen portfolio customers and we will endeavor to work with them and have a differentiated value.","I think we said for some time that we are hopeful and sort of expressive of the view that the economics for biosimilar should start of somewhere between a brand, fee-for-service and a generic fee-for-service with a high ASP top generic product.","And you could look at that 180 days sort of exclusivity period on generics where that might only be one product. So we've always said that GP dollars are good there because we've got a high average selling price still but because it's not that competitive element yet, you won't quite see the GP percentages that we've ultimately like when there's a competitive offering here. So, thank you.","Keri Mattox","Thanks Eric. Samantha, can we move on to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Thanks so much. Good morning. Steve, when we had the opportunity to spend time together in San Francisco we talked about the competitive market on the Independent side and talked a lot about CPA. I think that maybe one of your comments were misconstrued, you had said that time you were informed that a very large buying group has informed you they are going to move somewhere else. My understanding is that was back in the time frame of 2015 not for the most recent period. I just wanted to confirm that to start with?","Steven Collis","Yes, that was the contract last year we had a year ago. So that was - you know one way we've been able to retain about half of the customer base. But it certainly in the recent past history it's nothing that\u2019s current at all. So I apologize if I wasn\u2019t clear now is that all in the past.","We had - and thank you for the question because - so we\u2019re doing what we can and it\u2019s been a very good quarter with them. We are creating our market share with them with the wallets and I think we\u2019re using big data. We honestly have much better tools and ability to monitor compliance and one point maybe to explain compliance since why it's bilaterally important.","So I think that our sales reps at op-ed, we have the change healthcare relationships, so I think we have some new tools that really enable that communication and data of that communication. So we will continue to grow our commitment to the independent customer base and the services and I think in return our customers are understanding that we expect maximum share of wallet and if there are issues on crossing, talked us about it because it\u2019s a complex portfolio and if any one time we could be setting them a couple of thousand products, so talk to us if you\u2019re seeing things in marketplace and I think that\u2019s been very well accepted as the markets gets more challenging for the Independents, hopefully the objective is that they draw even closer to AmerisourceBergen.","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that clarification. And then just my one follow-up would just be for Tim. Tim you talked about the gross margins and the other segment and I think if I heard you correctly you said there were few pennies from manufacture rebates, does that pertain to the other segment specifically or I'm just saying about the sustainability of what we saw on the gross margin side and that side of the business as we move towards the next several quarters?","Tim Guttman","Yes, thanks Lisa. Let me clarify no, there\u2019re couple pennies we called out a little bit of timing and that would be in pharmaceutical distribution so more on the drug company side.","Steven Collis","And I think that we hit some rebates.","Tim Guttman","Yes.","Steven Collis","We had some great performance on achievements of sales goals which would - you never quite show you\u2019ve hit until the same literally so.","Tim Guttman","Right, yes the couple pennies to clarify - the couple pennies really we thought we would come as we earned in the March quarter they have pulled forward. We hit some triggers early but Steve point is right in terms of the MWI that our calendar year there are contracts of manufacturers around our calendar year and you always come down to proving that up based on final volumes and you have two different tiers and that helped us in the December quarter with MWI but that happens every December nothing unusual.","Lisa Gill","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric Coldwell","Thanks very much. Well my luck this morning my four questions have been asked and answered but I'm going to just do a very simple one. You mentioned Steve and I think Tim as well that you have done some tuck-in M&A probably a little more weighted to the other segment. The last deal I can track I think dates back about a year ago. So I don't think you've done much by looking or at the cash flow statement but could you give a sense how many deals have you done may be revenue or earnings magnitude over the last 12 months maybe some nature of what you've done in tuck-ins.","Steven Collis","We bought like Agri feed business up in one of the small provinces in Canada that was couple of million dollars that's the first deal that I wasn't present at that day in the office and the executive committee by the way would asked me so how small it was to approve the deal. But the point is we have tremendous faith and Jim and the team really know the regional competitors extremely well and part of their goals was in to make MWI the preferred distribution partner in case they are considering selling - so there is our train again.","So that's really what we would see but no Eric you're right essentially we've been investing a lot in our own business. So we\u2019ve done six new Greenfield distribution centers, we\u2019ve got tremendous investment going on in Lash our fusion project in those DCs, new systems for World Courier and a lot of new services for Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate.","So we\u2019ve got \u2013 there was a lot of great projects to keep us busy and we have a challenging but we think loyal customer segment. So always a lot for us to invest in a lot of work going on PharMEDium making sure that we are ahead of the curve there, Jim Adams and the teams made very, very interested in continuing to raise the bar there.","So there just a lot we can do internally and I think you\u2019re seeing a record capital investment here at AmerisourceBergen definitely since SIP, but probably in absolute dollars and maybe not comparative dollars but in absolute dollars and absolute record investment here this year.","Eric Coldwell","That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll leave it at that thanks so much Steve.","Keri Mattox","Samantha, I think we have time for may just one or two more questions to wrap up the hour.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. So just to touch quickly there has been a lot of commentary around obviously the brand price trajectory. And obviously commentary in the market around how brand manufacturers are handling those price increases or lower price increases versus historical what they\u2019re doing to change their negotiating strategy. As you think about the conversations you had with your key brand manufacturers over the last three, six months was the tender been in terms of offsetting service versus value, how you go to pitch your business to them and your value proposition in an environment where they may be a little more reluctant to take the pricing increases they had historically?","Steven Collis","Yes, and thanks again this is a wonderful question because we get to clarify, you know it\u2019s not that 10% of our fees get earned from inflation that\u2019s in 10% of the contract the dollar volume of the contracts we have a component that\u2019s earned from inflation. So that\u2019s an important clarification and we\u2019ve been trying to make that over the last few investor meetings.","I was actually in one of those meetings with one of our top five or six suppliers and I think our team was able to talk through that very professionally, very objectively it has been part of the value that we've traditionally earned and I think that\u2019s - there is a meritorious argument to move towards a very transparent model, but those conversations I think are ongoing and as those contracts renew with the manufacturers and new fee-for-service, we\u2019ll get - I believe that I'm very positive we\u2019ll get them done, we\u2019ll get that component that's graft inflation and move from the fee-for-service. Anything to add Tim?","Tim Guttman","I think the manufacturers realize we provide extremely valuable service in terms of the quantities we keep an inventory, the credit, the collections that we provide so I mean I think they realize it, it\u2019s a very good value and very economical. And we had discussions, we had fee-for-service agreements over 10 plus years and we see those continuing and we don\u2019t see those changing going forward though it seems to be very acceptable based on WAC pricing and that's how the industry is compensated.","Keri Mattox","Samantha I think we have time for just one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please go ahead.","David Larsen","Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the sell side like obviously there has been a bit of pressure on the independent space. Are we largely through that did those prices come in line with your expectations in the quarter and has that really been contained to the independent segment or have you seen any impact like the larger change or original change? Thanks.","Steven Collis","We didn\u2019t have a very active quarter in terms of renewals I mean that sort of a timing with how things go, we haven\u2019t had a very active quarter but when preparing for this call and we do of course every month our reviews, Tim and I meet with all the keys sales people in the drug company. Everything is pretty much as normal and our customers are hunkering down, looking at issues like the, our fees and other things that are challenging to them, looking at network composition staying in the network\u2019s performance network star ratings.","So nothing really it's a - I think our volume of generic compliance is certainly improving so some of the programs that we have introduced are showing they\u2019re approved today they\u2019re being productive. So nothing particular to report we\u2019re being consistent about this for a couple of quarters there. We don\u2019t see any fundamental changes in the way we market with independent pharmacies.","David Larsen","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then just one last quick one if President Trump gets more aggressive about putting pressure on drug company CEOs to control price and cost price to pull in. Are you taking steps now with regards to your contract to basically protect your margins going forward maybe if you could just give any incremental color around what you're doing or what you could do in the future if level of ground heats up even more that will be very helpful? Thanks.","Steven Collis","It\u2019s important to note that we really buy the wholesale acquisition cost and there is a lot of - once we ship and go and receive payment for those products which you can see we manage our DSO pretty well. There is a lot that goes on after that and it's by enlarge you know really past us. One of the strong attributes of AmerisourceBergen in terms of our existing model is, we don\u2019t build a lot of - we almost exclusively - 99% of our revenues we don\u2019t go third-party pass we\u2019re either building the manufacturer or the provider.","So a lot of that will really go past us. If there was a huge change with the growth rates and our industry were impacted, it would be a negative for us there is no doubt it would be a very, very strong headwind because we start off with the industry growing in the high single-digits. U.S. industry growing in the high single-digit so if that were to really alter, if we were to go to a flat industry I think we have flexible in our contracts, we would have to look at it on both the provider, the sell side and the buy side contract.","So that stands to reason and - but a lot of work to do that Congress would have to be involved and I think again that this is a remarkable industry with a lot of innovation. And I think we\u2019ll come up with the right solutions for the industry. And not necessary AmerisourceBergen I think our industry will come up with the right approach and we are proud to be part of that. So thank you. Keri, we\u2019ll wrap up now.","Keri Mattox","Yes Samantha, I think that was it for questions. Steve if you want to make any closing comments I think we all set with the hour.","Steven Collis","Yes, thank you. This was our first quarter with Keri, and I think she did a great job. So hopefully you all enjoying the interaction you have with AmerisourceBergen. We are really pleased with our strong start to the fiscal year. Pleased that we could raise the guidance for the balance of the year and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you at the end of next quarter and again we're excited about the progress we've made towards achieving our fiscal 2017 goals.

Our continued focus on operational excellence helped us deliver a strong third quarter with revenue increasing 11% to $43 billion and adjusted diluted EPS growing 8% to $1.54. Our ability to consistently execute and maximize our opportunities for growth has helped us successfully navigate an evolving market landscape and overcome internal challenges, including the lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium this year, putting us in a strong position to finish fiscal 2018 on track and within our guidance range.","We believe our results demonstrate the value that our businesses are creating for our manufacturer and provider partners and reinforce our long-term prospects for growth despite any near-term uncertainty. The importance of our work and our ability to consistently execute was on full display across our businesses during the third quarter. Over the past several weeks and months, many people have asked about the landscape for our industry and questioned our ability to adapt if there are changes to the model. In times like these I believe it's important to take a step back and look at our results in the context of the value we provide and the critical work we've already done to innovate in a fast changing market.","In our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Strategic Global Sourcing group, we saw continued performance and execution in the core distribution business, both in increasing volumes with our existing customers and supporting their growth. I'm excited and pleased to announce that our team has re-signed of our key anchor customers, Humana. We've had a long relationship with this strategic partner and this early renewal shows a mutual appreciation and strong desire to continue growing together.","Consistent with our customer contract rebalancing efforts, we were able to build a long term contract that is a win-win for both partners and one that does not create a margin headwind. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our history of strategic investment and leadership in the distribution of specialty products.","We have the best franchise, key customer relationships and continued support to launch our virtually all new specialty products. This quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter with 10% of greater revenue growth for this part of the business. The connection we provide between manufacturers and our physician customers enables us to best support the commercialization of specialty products, both new innovative products and new biosimilar products, and empower those physicians to best serve their patients.","As a brief update on PharMEDium, I'm proud of the execution of our associates in remediating at PharMEDium's Memphis facility. You'll recall we voluntarily suspended operations in December. We've been in active communication with the FDA and two weeks ago we notified the FDA of our intent to resume limited production at the Memphis facility and commence commercial distribution this month. We expect production in Memphis to increase gradually over time and to be fully operational in fiscal 2019.","While this process has certainly taken longer than we originally expected, enhancing PharMEDium's quality assurance and quality control programs to ensure patient safety was our top priority. We feel we are best positioned in the industry to meet and grow market demand while delivering the highest quality and safety products to our customers.","Additionally, we are encouraged by the FDA's draft guidance explaining how compounding from bulk drug substance generally presents great risk to patient than PharMEDium's model of compounding from FDA approved drugs. The guidance provides further clarity and increased oversight around its 503B standards; both positives for our business and patient safety.","On to our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group. World Courier continues to be the partner of choice for global clinical trial logistics driving demand and innovating to further enhance their differentiation in the market. The team at World Courier is delivering excellent results and executing world class logistics moving innovation forward. We are proud to be at the forefront of supporting the successful commercialization and launch of cell and gene therapies.","At Lash Group, we're continuing the rollout of the Fusion platform and successfully on-boarding new business. However, the migration of customers to this new platform continues to take longer than we had anticipated. We are being thoughtful in how and when we migrate programs to the new system to ensure there's zero disruption in service level. Lash is the leader in supporting access and adherence programs to ensure patients receive the best possible care.","Additionally, we are excited by the recent launch of Lash's new electronic benefit verification solution, which utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning and will accelerate speed to therapy and improve the care delivery experience for patients and providers. The investment and work to launch these new offerings improves patient access to lifesaving medications and enhances patient engagement and outcomes.","The services provided by Lash are key to supporting manufacturer programs and the business is positioned to meet the commercialization needs of the next generation of therapies. Innovation continues to be vital to the important work that we do throughout AmerisourceBergen as we continue to improve our value proposition for manufacturers and downstream provider customers.","AmerisourceBergen has invested for decades to ensure we offer differentiated value to our manufacturer and provider customers of all sizes. That culture of execution and continued innovation has positioned AmerisourceBergen as a best-in-class partner with leading edge solutions.","For example, a couple of weeks ago we hosted ThoughtSpot, our annual tradeshow for independent pharmacists where we had record customer attendance and engagement. The energy, excitement and drive to continue to grow and support independent pharmacies and their patients was overwhelming. Now is a great time to be an independent pharmacy owner. We're seeing people shift their mindsets from strictly treating illness to managing their health and improving their wellbeing. Because of that, the community pharmacy is positioned to provide the personalized healthcare experience that consumers expect. To meet the changing independent pharmacy needs, we continue to improve the programs and services we offer to Good Neighbor Pharmacy and the Elevate Provider Network.","We are supporting the growth of independent pharmacies and continue to advocate for new value-based payment models that reflect the care pharmacists provide. Not just the products they dispense, but also for the services and advice they provide their patients. As I talk with our independent pharmacy partners, their entrepreneurial spirit is contagious and they are encouraged by the new opportunities for their pharmacies and how they can further the critical consultative role they play in their local communities. In many parts of the country, these pharmacies are the only accessible healthcare destination, which means that the pharmacist plays an important role in the community and they have the unique opportunity to help manage the inherent challenges that many patients face.","Our GMP independent pharmacies have built up significant trust in their local communities and provide the best healthcare through personalized and differentiated service. Examples like these illustrate the important role AmerisourceBergen plays in the healthcare system and demonstrates how we create value for our partners in unique ways.","Another key customer is the manufacturer and we continue to help these key partners successfully navigate the complexity of the U.S. healthcare system. We service more than 50,000 sites throughout the United States, providing pharmaceuticals from hundreds of manufacturers each morning, with an impeccable track record of order accuracy. All of this while bringing significant distribution center automation and vital security to the supply chain.","People often lose sight of the fact that if you're a manufacturer, whether you have one product or hundreds of products, you only need agreements in place with one to three partners in order to provide every patient in the United States access to your pharmaceutical at any of the tens of thousands of sites of care. That is no small feat. Rather than build out a complex distribution system which requires investments to ensure security and efficiency, our key networks to track, monitor and process specific customer contract prices and purchase orders and a financial arm to administer the credit and collection functions, manufacturers can instead allocate their resources back into the healthcare system and invest in research and development with a goal of developing the next class of lifesaving or life changing drugs.","Pharmaceuticals are the most efficient care option, improving patient lives and keeping people out of their local hospital or doctor's office. Our ability to execute day in and day out and succeed in this highly regulated and complex market enables the utilization of and access to pharmaceuticals.","We thought it was important to take this step back today and provide some additional detail and context regarding the vital role AmerisourceBergen plays in the U.S. healthcare supply chain. All too often, debates regarding our country's healthcare system occur at a headline level with the cost of care and the price of prescription drugs grabbing the attention. The intricacies of how everything else works never receives equal prominence.","At AmerisourceBergen, our model is built on being able to efficiently navigate a highly regulated market while delivering value to the supply chain. The cost savings we provide through economies of scale, efficiency, security, continuous investment, automation, IT systems and a high quality balance sheet are tremendously valuable for providers and manufacturers. The current fee for service model provides transparency for both manufacturers and distributors and we believe this serves as an efficient and addressable way of delivering appropriate compensation for the value we provide.","If there are changes to the model, we will be at the forefront of discussions with manufacturers and other stakeholders to ensure that our important role in the supply chain continues to be recognized.","As we think about our role beyond distribution and services, we remain steadfast in our commitment to build healthier futures by fostering a positive impact on the world. Corporate citizenship isn't just an obligation we have, but it's a promise we keep. We are thoughtfully improving our business practices and operations to work mindfully and measurably towards reducing our environmental impact. In addition, we provide volunteer opportunities and support like-minded organizations through the AmerisourceBergen Foundation.","We've detailed our progress in the 2017 Corporate Citizenship report that is now available on our website. While it's only a representative summary, this report provides visibility into our purpose, our accomplishments and our priorities moving forward as we continue to embed corporate citizenship values into everything we do.","In summary, we continue to demonstrate the value we provide every day to both healthcare providers and manufacturers in navigating our complex and dynamic healthcare system.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tim for a more in depth discussion of our quarterly financial results and our financial guidance updates for fiscal 2018.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. For a discussion of our GAAP results, I would ask that you please refer to our earnings release. I also want to remind everyone that we are now in our second quarter of consolidating the adjusted financial results of Profarma Brazil and the specialty joint venture. For comparability to prior financial results, we continue to include a schedule in our press release which illustrates the financial impact of consolidating these businesses.","On an operational note, we wrapped up our third fiscal quarter with solid performance in our business albeit still challenged by results at PharMEDium. Our ABC team continues to focus on executing our strategy, delivering the best customer experience and ensuring we are operationally efficient. All of this translates into positive financial results.","With that, we can begin our Q3 financial review. I will provide commentary in two main areas. First, I will discuss our quarterly consolidated and segment performance; and the second area, I will provide a brief update of our fiscal 2018 expectations.","We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.54, an increase of 8%. This included a $0.01 benefit from consolidated Brazil. Our consolidated revenues were $43 billion, up a strong 11%. Gross profit also increased 11% or $116 million to about $1.2 billion. However, when excluding the impact from Brazil, our gross profit would have increased 5% or $56 million. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment contributed most of the increase and they did this while covering a significant year-over-year headwind from PharMEDium.","Operating expenses increased 19% or $113 million to $697 million. Brazil contributed nearly half of that percentage growth and dollar increase. Excluding Brazil, consolidated OpEx grew 10% and about half of this increase is the direct result of Pharmaceutical Distribution's acquisition of H.D. Smith earlier this fiscal year.","Importantly, when backing out Brazil and H.D. Smith, we are right in line with our OpEx growth expectations from the beginning of the fiscal year. We remain diligent in spending in the right areas while staying focused on always leveraging our infrastructure.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $474 million, up about 1% from last year. On a comparative basis, so excluding consolidated Brazil, our operating income was just slightly lower or down about 1% versus last year.","As I mentioned at the start, we're pleased that our volumes and margins were both slightly better than we expected but the results weren't enough to completely offset the PharMEDium year-over-year headwind. In terms of operating margin, we were down 12 basis points, primarily due to our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment's lower margin.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net and other increased by a combined $8 million. Excluding Brazil, the net increase was $5 million and due primarily to the new debt issued for our H.D. Smith acquisition.","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was just under 21% and reflects the positive impact from tax reform and the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Excluding this tax rate benefit, we would've been comparable to last year's tax rate. Both periods include our annual tax return to provision true up as well as contributions from our R&D tax credit program. Our adjusted net income after backing out the Brazil non-controlling equity interest was $341 million, an increase of 7% driven mostly by our lower tax rate and corresponding tax expense.","During the quarter, we made good progress on our commitment to keep our share count flat for the year and we purchased about $265 million of shares, of which a small dollar amount was settled and paid in early July. Consequently at quarter end, our diluted share count decreased to 221 million shares. We exited the quarter with roughly $465 million remaining on our current board share repurchase authorization.","Moving over to cash flow and our cash balance. As discussed last quarter, our inventory was somewhat elevated in March as we carried extra inventory to ensure the on-boarding of new business was seamless. This quarter we realized a benefit from normalizing and also optimizing our inventory levels. Consequently, our free cash flow was an impressive $744 million. This means that on a year-to-date basis, we are now at approximately $500 million for free cash flow.","We are tracking well and we remain confident in our adjusted full year free cash flow guidance range of $1.35 billion to $1.6 billion which, at the midpoint, is just under $7 of free cash flow per share. Finally, from a cash standpoint, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash which included about $1 billion offshore. This finishes the review of our consolidated results.","Next let me switch and cover our segment results. We can begin with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Total segment revenues were nearly $42 billion, up 12%. Growth would have been 11% excluding Profarma Brazil. Consistent with the past quarter, this segment benefits from two key drivers of revenue growth. First, our strategic relationships with our anchor long term customers provided the majority of our revenue growth. Examples of this would be the new business with our largest customer Walgreens. As a reminder, this is our first full quarter servicing all of their acquired Rite Aid pharmacies.","Through Walgreens, we also continue to benefit from incremental alliantRx specialty business. Additionally, I want to highlight that several of our other anchor customers, especially in health systems and independent retail, grew especially well and faster than the market. And the second key revenue driver was our industry leading specialty distribution business defined by us as the distribution of oncology and physician administered drugs. This part of our business continues to grow as a result of developing the right mix of customers, providing the right practice management tools and value to our customers and importantly being the best positioned to support the new, innovative specialty drugs entering the market.","This quarter we finished with just under $10 billion in revenues and our year-over-year growth was 13%, our highest growth rate in several quarters. We had solid growth in lines shipped which drove the revenue increase, especially in oncology and to a lesser extent in ophthalmology and other therapeutic areas. Wrapping up the segment revenue discussion, since the 11% revenue growth ex-Brazil is mostly due to new business including H. D. Smith, it's important to highlight that revenue growth on a more normalized basis is just a little under half of our reported growth rate. We're pleased with this growth rate and it's clearly above market.","Moving to segment operating income. We had an increase of about 3% to $393 million. Growth excluding Profarma Brazil was a solid 2%. Solid because we successfully covered the financial headwind from PharMEDium where our units shipped were down significantly because of the Memphis facility being closed during the quarter. As I mentioned we're pleased that the segment ex PharMEDium had balanced acquisition across many of its businesses. We benefited from very good revenue growth, disciplined OpEx spending and solid margins.","As Steve and I both highlighted, we're pleased that PharMEDium's Memphis facility is now operational, although with limited production. The business has worked diligently on remediation, implementing new processes and controls and fortifying the team with new staff and leadership. We continue to expect Memphis to be fully operational in fiscal 2019, as we are being thoughtful about how we ramp production at the facility. As we highlighted earlier, patient safety and providing the highest quality products to our customers are the top priorities for the business. By doing this, we continue to be the market leader and the preferred partner.","We can now move to the other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health and includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. As a reminder, we consolidated our Brazil specialty joint venture in this segment. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up 9%. When excluding the Brazil specialty JV revenues grew 3.5% led by World Courier and NMR, our Canadian specialty business which is part of Consulting. World Courier, like they have all year, continues delivering excellent results with records again this quarter in both the number of shipments handled and billable weight. They continue to expand strategic relationships with key customers while picking up incremental business from new customers.","Moving to MWI. The revenues were relatively flat partly due to a tough comparison with last year's revenue being unusually high. More importantly, MWI's top line was negatively impacted by one manufacturer that switched pharmaceutical products back in January to agency from buy sell. Normalized for the products switched to agency from buy sell, our Companion Animal segment would have grown in the mid-single digit range while the Production Animal segment was down slightly due to general market factors.","From an operating income standpoint, excluding Brazil, this segment had operating income of $81 million, down about $10 million or 11%. For the quarter, World Courier had outstanding operating income growth due to higher revenues and continued leveraging of their best-in-class infrastructure. The segment was significantly impacted by performance at Lash consulting. The good news is that our Fusion implementation is progressing and we added another key manufacturer to the platform. We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from our partners on this new leading technology platform.","However, costs continue to be higher than we anticipated during the go live period as it has taken longer to migrate existing programs and large amounts of health data to the new system. Additionally, we continue to see a slightly slower new business development pipeline in the market. We are pleased with the our contract win percentage validating that manufacturers understand the value Lash provides in the drug commercializing process, but the sheer size of the wins are lower than we expected.","Just recently our Lash business was selected as the partner of choice and new business will be moving over from a competitor. Access to our Fusion system was a key factor in the switch. This reinforces our confidence that investing in innovation will enable Lash to be the best positioned in the market. This completes our segment review.","Let me transition and cover our full year expectations. Most of our previous guidance metrics are not being revised. I would like to spend a few minutes and provide additional commentary on a handful of key items and a few changes. Let me start with PharMEDium. Again, we are pleased that we are now operational in Memphis. Given the extended phase ramp in Memphis, we are not changing our previous guidance. We continue to expect only a nominal contribution from the business in Q4 and this contribution will be significantly less then that in Q4 of last year.","On the manufacturer pricing front, we are still comfortable with our guidance assumption for brand inflation. Given recent activity in the market, we will likely finish toward the bottom of our 6% to 7% range. Regarding the generic deflation rate, our buy side range has been at minus 7% to minus 9%. We are certainly encouraged by recent discussions in the market, specifically around SKU rationalization and rightsizing supply to demand. At this point, we aren't changing our range given we are closing in on the end of our fiscal year and we are forecasting that our cumulative deflation rate will stay within the range.","In terms of operating income, there is no change to our guidance for consolidated or Pharmaceutical Distribution segment operating income. However for our other segment with one quarter left and performance to-date, EBIT growth for this segment is being revised to down 4% to down 7%. Continued headwinds at our Lash consulting business and slightly lower growth than we expected at our MWI business is causing the revision.","Switching to our full year tax rate. Due to continued tax initiatives and benefits from certain discrete tax items, we are revising our tax rate down to about 22%. As I wrap up, adjusted EPS, our range remains at $6.45 to $6.65. Consistent with last quarter when we said that our second half adjusted EPS would be about $3, we continue to track this way and consequently expect to finish our fiscal 2018 near the bottom of our EPS range. We are executing well in the current environment and succeeding in offsetting the headwind from PharMEDium.","Looking ahead, we are strategically positioned in the market and look forward to resuming growth of our operating income in fiscal 2019 and beyond. As it pertains to fiscal 2019 guidance, our corporate process continues to be that we will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for our guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.","In closing, our principles remain strongly in place. We are aligned on providing the best customer experience. We are highly focused on execution and we are always financially disciplined. All of this enables us to advance our business and drive long term stakeholder value.","Thank you. Now let me turn the call back over to Steve for some final remarks before Q&A.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Before we proceed with Q&A, I would like to take a moment to thank our associates. The execution of our strategy wouldn't be possible without the 21,000 AmerisourceBergen associates who drive our value proposition and live our purpose every day. It's their performance that reminds me that we have the strongest team, the broadest experience and the deepest expertise in the industry.","We are extremely proud of the critical role that we play in supporting our customers and ensuring patients have access to the highest quality healthcare treatments. Our businesses are established leaders in their markets with key long-term strategic relationships, both with services that support manufacturer commercialization objectives and solutions that support the growth and longevity of our provider customers.","Over the last year, our associates have propelled the transformation of our business and are collaborating to serve our manufacturer and provider customers in more efficient and integrated ways. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned for long-term growth. We have invested and innovated to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers, driving value for our shareholders and ultimately serving patients. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. As always, we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen.","Now, here's Bennett to start our Q&A.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Operator, who do we have as our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Steve, I just wanted to hit on a high level topic that seems to be on everybody's mind. While you're drug distribution business seemed to have a good quarter, there's been a lot of concerns on the path going forward with respect to some of the recent manufacturer commentary on price inflation and maybe secondarily on the administration's blueprint with respect to the potential transition from gross to net pricing. Could you maybe talk about those two issues and how you think that could potentially impact AmerisourceBergen on a go-forward basis?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. And obviously, it's a question that's come up a lot. We obviously are very conversant, very familiar with negotiating with both brand manufacturers and our large customers, our small customers. And that's sort of what our role is. I always like to tell the story that we're nobody's customer and we're always negotiating with everybody.","And as you know, we live in a world where we have well-heeled competitors and we compete every day. And I think we also are very familiar with defending our value proposition.","So, first of all, I think these changes are probably, over the long-term, going to happen. It seems like there's some opaqueness and also some elements of the current pricing system that are difficult for patients with chronic diseases, big deductibles, the donut hole. So we've learned a lot. We have constant discussions with manufacturers. We've learned a lot. We're very informed and we do think there'll have to be changes.","We also are very confident that AmerisourceBergen and our industry can defend the value that we have and we can adjust our contracts. I mean, part of what we've been talking for a couple of years about is our rebalancing effort and that's because we will adjust sell-sides if buy-sides change. But we also feel that the compensation we receive from brand manufacturers is very fair. It's a transparent model. We're proud of the work that AmerisourceBergen did in being one of the leaders in switching to the fee-for-service industry. And we don't think that there's a theme from anybody that our fees are too high or the services.","And we had a good quarter. But look, at the end of the day, look at the operating profit that we report. With all the different businesses we have, our value is very defensible, very fair. And if we were not here, if we did not have the service, there would be a tremendous negative pressures on the whole industry.","And we built these services up that we provide to our customers and to the manufacturers literally over three or four decades. And we think they're all relevant and up to date and we think our portfolio is ideally tweaked to help launch these products, support mature products, launch new biosimilars, manage through generic cycles. And just these services are not easy replicable and they're highly defensible in my opinion.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for those comments. Maybe if I can just ask Tim one quick follow-up. Tim, obviously a good quarter in drug distribution, but the question we're getting this morning is what's sort of implied in the 4Q guidance? Because essentially, given the size of the beat and just the maintaining, it kind of suggests that 4Q may be a little bit lower. And I just wanted to try to put that in perspective as we think about potential headwinds and tailwinds as we're about to enter fiscal 2019. Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, thanks Glen, good morning. As Steve said and you said, we're really pleased. Our Distribution segment had a very good quarter, reminding everybody that we covered that headwind from PharMEDium. Rather than just make minor tweaks in guidance, I mean, we do think the Distribution segment will be down slightly in Q4. Again, we called out the PharMEDium headwind in Q4. Again, it's a little bit larger in Q4. And again, that's probably the main item that we're calling out. And I would say also year-over-year we've taken our estimate down slightly on inflation given the current activity that we've seen out there because of July.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess actually just to pick up there, Tim, as you think about the lack of branded increases you've seen in July and I know you're not giving guidance on next year, but could you maybe just help us frame a little bit what type of a tailwind the typical branded increases would imply on any given year? I mean I think everyone understands, Steve, to your point about the value proposition overall. But if we just think more tactically in an environment where there are less branded price increases, how should we think about that headwind if this continues into next fiscal year?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks Bob. I mean I'll start and Steve can jump in. I mean certainly we saw there's activity out there and commentary. We're seeing less brand price increases in July. That will carry through most likely to the end of the fiscal year. It's too early to really speculate on what's going to happen in January. We had a number of price increases in January of 2018. Certainly, I think we've always said that there's \u2013 we have a little bit of exposure on brand price increases and the contribution we get from those.","We've worked really hard to shift those agreements and not rely on those. We've done a terrific job in shifting to fee for service and we'll continue to do so. That's our goal. So I mean I think just depending on what happens in the market we're in a little bit of a hold pattern here. We'll see what happens. Again it's a little bit early to speculate on what's going to change as we get into the New Year. And always, if see a change, we'll go back and we'll modify our approach and as Steve mentioned, we'll negotiate and we'll make sure we get fair value on the service we provide.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I mean, just to put a bit of a finer point on it, as Tim said that, we do have \u2013 we've talked about 10% of our supplier contracts where we do get compensated on inflation and that comes disproportionately in that January quarter. But you should assume that we will have that discussion if inflation assumptions change. And again, the inflation rate that we experience \u2013 this is the point we made in the script. This is not a headline business. It's too complicated, the whole way that pharma pricing works. And it's not necessarily the inflation rate we experience is the inflation rate that consumers, patients, government agencies experience. In fact we know that that's quite the opposite and there's somewhere around up to 30% of wholesale acquisition cost that still gets discounted through to the consumer.","My point earlier was that that system is somewhat sticky. It's really embedded in the way that large procurers, payers, employers are used to contracting and we don't see that changing in a quarter or two. It's a change that probably will happen but we think it's going to be very gradual. And hopefully it's going to happen through changes in business practices that we're a part of the dialogue of. It's not going to happen probably as soon as January of 2019. That would be my best guess. It just doesn't seem to work like that.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I guess, Steve, if I may, I think there might be a little bit of maybe misunderstanding out there too when people look at our results and they look at that period of the March quarter, so January, February, March and again why do we have a higher contribution, higher operating income people just naturally go to that's all related to price appreciation. But there is some seasonality in the business. And as you look at the winter month, you look at flu season, some of our businesses just perform better, have higher volumes, higher revenue, we ship more lines. So again, there is seasonality in the business and it's not related totally or it's not related it's not all \u2013 again, I think that's a little bit of a misnomer that it's related to PA and that's exposure. That's not the case.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Take Lash Group for example, Tim. We do extreme \u2013 that's our busiest benefit verification period because we're re-verifying everyone's benefit for the programs we do. So that's another example of why it's a good quarter. But hopefully, Bob, that's maybe a longer answer than you expected but it's...","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, no. I appreciate all that. I'll stop there. Thanks guys.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We feel positive about it. And I think there's some confusion out there. So we're happy to go on the record and give you what our sincere views of how we see some of this playing out.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, thanks for the questions guys. Steve, appreciate the comments earlier on talking about the services that you provide in Distribution and the scale and the breadth that you've built over time, not just yourself but the industry overall. And I noticed then also your comments around independent pharmacies. But when you think about some of the disruption that's possibly coming, right, just as obviously everyone's talking about Amazon and acquiring PillPack here. I guess the question really more is down the road, what do you think about the risk profile for independent pharmacies? Clearly I think the pharmacies that are still around today have managed to find ways to compete in a world where you have these large team pharmacies. Maybe can you just speak to the characteristics of these independent pharmacies? Do think they can face this kind of new set of challenges coming down the road?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. We just came back from our ThoughtSpot. And it's honestly always inspiring that we had 3,000 independent pharmacies there. These guys are great entrepreneurs. They do so many challenges from networks to TRRPs. To just frankly competing against a CVS and a Rite Aid, and of course Walgreens, our largest customer. It's daunting. But they're very confident in their service model. They're extremely confident in their relationships with their patients. And we have heard very interesting stories about a local payer or local employment or even the government changing the way that benefits get designed.","And them being able to use their patients to advocate and get that change because many times they are that source of care in the community. The relationships \u2013 you should have seen our Good Neighbor Pharmacy of the Year winner. I mean, he lives in a county with there are 50,000 people but 4,000 people in the town he lives in in Wyoming. And he just does amazing things in his community, families of all the community. And he knows all his patients. He knows their kids. I think he knows their animals.","That's obviously \u2013 that's not a representative song but that's just one story. But I got to spend time with him and his family. And these guys provide a unique service. The counseling they provide is second to none. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we get recognized for that. And that maybe on the financial counseling side that there's more room and availability, less restrictions on pharmacists doing that sort of work.","So just to comment on PillPack, it's one form of how patients can access medications. I have a friend whose mom uses them who really likes it. That's just one patient. I mean some people like to shop online; some people like to go to Nordstrom; some people like to go to fancy stores on Fifth Avenue. That a sliver of the overall market. But the big markets are, we feel are going to be independent pharmacy, the retailers. Mail order's reached a certain level and certain patients like that. But it's another way to access medications and we don't see that particular customer is going to be a huge percentage of the market for the moment. And obviously we'll keep an eye on it.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. Just maybe I can follow up on -just a clarification on PharMEDium. You said you notified the FDA that your intent to start \u2013 you're in production now. Is there any other communication you need to receive from FDA at this point? Or is it this point you've had your conversations and now it's just making sure you have the processes in place? What sort of next step regulatory wise are we waiting for? Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks Charles. No, we're really pleased. Memphis is open. We are in production. We expect to ship, like we said, in August here commercially, so we're gearing up for that. We've always been in active conversations with the FDA. And we would expect in due course, like they do with others, that they would come in and at some point do their work at Memphis. But again, we're off and running we're pleased. And again we're pleased that we've made the changes. It's taken a little bit of while but it's all about getting product back out to our customers who want it and need it for their patients.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks you. I'll stop there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny. Please go ahead.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Michael? Okay, operator, let's move to the next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Ricky?","Operator","I apologize. One moment please.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator let's move to the next question please.","Operator","Ricky, your line is open, please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes we can. Thanks, Ricky.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. So my first question is on generic inflation. In the prepared remarks you talked about the cumulative generic deflation still at a negative 7% to negative 9%. But can you share with us what you're seeing in the spot market? Are you seeing some improvement in deflation trends? And also what you're seeing on the sell side?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Ricky. We would say that notably deflation is easing a bit and you're seeing it in some of the industry data. We probably feel like this is a level that we're going to be sitting at for a while unless any market changes. We will incorporate it into our 2019 guidance, but it's just something we feel that we now are working through and it seems like that's the norm. But it's stable at these levels. We have been encouraged by, as one would anticipate because it's a logical business reaction and we're dealing with large public companies for the most part, that some manufacturers are talking about the rationalization of product lines. And we do see the markets firming in certain instances in a bit which is positive for anyone.","On the sell side, we're very proud of the programs. We have really re-contracted with so much of our customer base. I think if I look at the release today one of the things we're most proud of is we re-signed one of our largest customers without too much fuss on a win-win basis for everybody. And I think that's reflective of the value and the way that we're contracting with our customers, we're putting a lot of \u2013 not necessarily on this contract at all \u2013 but generally we're saying we're going to give you the best pricing. Here's what our needs are; here's where we think brand price inflates and where prices are; here's what we think's happening with biosimilars, with generics, mature generics, new cell-based therapies, and we contract for all those different categories.","And I think we are very transparent but also very demanding of our customers. You sign a contract with us, we expect you to adhere to those clauses because they are \u2013 as we said, they're very precise. And we're dealing with sophisticated counterparties in most cases. Even with the independent pharmacies, we're usually dealing with buying groups. So, we're very thoughtful about it and we expect our customers to be and we certainly expect that they understand we need to make a fair return on the business. So, hopefully that makes sense.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, one follow-up there. When we think about genetic deflation to your point kind of like stable to negative 7% to negative 9%, in guidance you highlight to us always brand inflation and then generic deflation. So as we think about these two factors, it would be very helpful for us if you can help us just to understand which one has a greater impact on guidance? So, how would you rank branded inflation impact on your forecast versus generic inflation?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, generics is much more the volume; brand is a lot more of the dollars. But it's hard to gauge it. I think we've been very candid with you. Over the last three years or so we've been very surprised at how stubbornly persistent the downdraft on generics was, right? And we've had to work through it, but we feel now that that's something we've incorporated into our numbers and our guidance. And I think we're managing through it.","On brand, we're busy assessing it. Obviously, the political climate has changed. There's more rhetoric about it than there's ever been. And it's one of the things that we will try to think through as we look to fiscal year 2019. But maybe Tim can give you some further color on how we think about it.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I don't really have much to add. I mean again, generic deflation, we're pleased it's easing. Just to go back to Steve's comment, we talk about cumulative because we're nine months into the year. Generic deflation's a headwind. We just have to price appropriately in the market. But Steve's absolutely right. I mean generic deflation's always a little bit more impactful to us on our P&L than brand inflation.","But clearly, you have to look at both and we'll look at both as we exit 2018 into 2019.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please go ahead.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. Steve and Tim, there's a lot of discussion in the investment community about what we call like the make-whole thesis, which is kind of through this pricing change, can you guys sustain the level of value that you derive from both manufacturers and dispensers?","So I guess can you say, as it relates to the fee-for-service model in distribution, how much of the current fee-for-service margin is based on underlying list prices and how much is based on what I'll call a different assessment of value provided by the wholesaler to the different constituents?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, we made comments that it's about 90% of the grant purchases are covered by fee-for-service and we don't benefit from (53:59). There's still a few contracts which cover \u2013 two of them are pretty significant where we don't \u2013 we do benefit from inflation.","And you should assume these discussions with those manufacturers and in some of their cases the inflation rates may not change. But we're having those iterative discussions all the time. We don't just meet with our large suppliers once every three years and renew the fee-for-service contract. There are new products that get launched, there's issues that come up from time to time. There's contracts that expire at different rates.","So we have very large resources devoted to negotiating with both brand and generic suppliers. And the brand team is a team where I know a lot of people personally. We've added terrific resources there. They're some of the most talented people in the company. And I think we are very, very honed in our messaging and I think it's very understood the value we bring. And again, going back to the results that we report, very defensible.","When you look at everything that AmerisourceBergen does, and it's a very fair return that we get; a fair return on invested capital and a fair operating margin and again, these are very reimbursement sensitive products. Sometimes these fees are not \u2013 hard to move on. I'm very familiar of course with Part B and we prosper in this environment and we had good growth. Our customers are doing well and I think that we will manage through this. We're confident that we will manage through this. It's somewhat disconcerting that there's so lack of confidence when this industry has developed, has demonstrated value over three or four decades and consistent value and an ability to transition.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think, Steve, again, I mean, people need to remember, we operate world class supply chain systems. And this year we're on track. We'll make less than 1% after tax. We provide incredible value every day just in time delivery. And again, like Steve said, it will take some work, but we're very confident on the value we provide and it's defensible and we think it's very supportable and appropriate.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, can you hear me this time?","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, go ahead Mike.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, perfect. Thank you. Just diving back into the 4Q numbers, not necessarily to get 2019 guidance, but to think about the business. In terms of the implied ramp into 4Q on the profitability for Pharma, it seems like if you assume flat for the year, which is your guidance, that it's a pretty meaningful step-down. You talked about PharMEDium being a bigger headwind. You talked about that change in brand. Are there any pieces in terms of that 4Q bridge that we should think about in terms of getting us to that flat number? Or is flat more a round number in terms of how we should think about it given Tim's comments on it being down modestly? Or slightly?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Again, thanks Mike. I'll jump in again and maybe just repeat a little bit. I mean again, PharMEDium's headwind, we don't expect that to continue. While Q1 to 2019 though, will have a little bit of a headwind again lapping PharMEDium. But Q4 tends to be a lower contribution period for us. Again, with PharMEDium, the brand inflation, our legacy specialty business is a little bit lower and our OpEx tends to be a little bit higher as we exit the year. So I don't think that necessarily Q4 is an indicator, a true indicator for what Q1 will be necessarily. There are some unique aspects of Q4. So hopefully that helps. Steve.","Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, thanks, everyone. And I hope we've had a good dialogue on our industry and the value that we provide. Tim and myself are very proud of this quarter. We think we showed a lot of the resilience and strength that we have. We've executed on core initiatives. We're incredibly pleased on that. We took our time with PharMEDium. There's no doubt about it. But the team worked hard. We brought in some new talent and we will begin commercial operations this month. That's a big step for us. We think we've worked collaboratively with regulators and we're excited that we can get back to doing what we do best here which is taking care of customers and doing that in the safest possible way.","And the same could be said for all of our businesses. AmerisourceBergen is creating value for our customers, for our suppliers and for the healthcare system as a whole. And we'll look forward to seeing some of you in the next couple of months.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's Earnings Conference Call covering our third quarter fiscal year 2013 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2012, as well as our quarterly filings for fiscal 2013.","Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now, here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I am pleased to report solid performance for AmerisourceBergen in our third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2013. Let me start by highlighting a 13% increase in revenue, which was driven primarily by our base business and less of a headwind from generics. During the quarter, we have had only a modest amount of new volume from our Walgreens contract. As we look ahead to the end of our fiscal year '13, while there are obviously still some moving pieces that could potentially impact our results, we are comfortable narrowing our forecasted range for adjusted earnings per share from continued operations for the full year to $3.06 to $3.11.","As we reviewed our performance, it was clear to me that, as usual, AmerisourceBergen accomplished a great deal in the June quarter. Our priorities continue to be to strengthen our business, advance our strategic initiatives and generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders. In accordance with those objectives, we completed the divestitures of our Canadian drug wholesale business and our contract packaging business. Most significantly, we obtained regulatory clearance for the equity portion of our new long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. In light of the expansion of the scale of our business, we improved our financial flexibility by commensurately expanding borrowing capacity under our revolver and securitization programs. Our associates have worked tirelessly on these diverse objectives while keeping their eye on the ball and ensuring that our current business is performing well, and we continue to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and the patients we all ultimately serve.","It has been just over 4 months since we announced our strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and I am more convinced than ever that we have before us, an incredible long-term opportunity, not only to increase efficiency with which healthcare is provided in the U.S., but also to expand the reach of pharmaceuticals across the world and improve patient access to medications across many geographies. Working in conjunction with Walgreens and Alliance Boots is proving to be very collaborative as we work to implement the 3 key components of the relationship, namely, the pharmaceutical distribution agreement with Walgreens, the access to the Walgreens and Alliance Boots purchasing joint venture and the leveraging of our collective strengths in different platforms, both domestically and internationally. In addition, we always believe the equity warrants that were issued as part of the agreements not only gives our partners the opportunities to share in our future success, but also clearly differentiates our relationship. We are proud to be collaborating with 2 of the world's leading and most successful healthcare companies, and I am very pleased with the energy and creativity with which we are moving forward.","In our various customer and manufacturer meetings, I am constantly reminded how fortunate we are to play such an integral role in the changing health care landscape. The health care marketplace is one of the most complex in the world, but we believe that complexity yields opportunities. AmerisourceBergen's diverse range of services and unique scale and reach places us in a pivotal position to take advantage of both opportunities by improving the efficiency with which products are launched, distributed and dispensed, and by helping to ensure that patients have access to the full complement of therapies that are available today. The strategic initiatives we have undertaken in the last several months have strengthened our ability to provide greater service and more innovative solutions to all AmerisourceBergen's customers and to all of the manufacturers whose products we distribute and support in the marketplace every day. The increasing rate of change demand that we continuously explore ways to drive efficiency without sacrificing the quality of care and service delivered, and we are excited to be able to do that with the help of global partners.","Turning now to the performance of our business units in the June quarter. Revenues in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation were up 16% due primarily to an increase in sales volume relating from our previously announced new contract with our large PBM customer, and less of a headwind from generic conversions in the quarter. ABDC's revenues will continue to ramp up in our fourth quarter as we begin to serve all of Walgreens stores under our new contract.","We are making great strides in preparing our network for the on-boarding of the Walgreens pharmacy distribution business. In addition to increasing capacity of certain aspects of our infrastructure, we are running pilot programs which, to date, have enabled us to transact with about 6,000 of Walgreens pharmacy locations on a daily basis. That number will continue to increase as we approach the September 1 start date of the new contract. Pharmaceutical Distribution is, of course, our primary area of expertise and the foundation of our business, and we remain quite confident that we can provide outstanding service to Walgreens without sacrificing any of the excellent service our other customers have come to expect from AmerisourceBergen.","Over the last several months, we've had an open dialogue with our customers about what a stronger AmerisourceBergen could ultimately mean for them. Tomorrow, I'll be attending our annual retail tradeshow in Las Vegas where we will be showcasing our vision for the future of pharmacy and renewing our commitment to our independent customer base. Whether it's through an improved Pro Generics formulary, proprietary franchise store products, new shared clinical systems that will facilitate third-party contracting or enhanced payer relationships, our partnership with Walgreens and Alliance Boots will help drive compelling new offerings for our independent customers in the years ahead. Our new partners share our goal of strengthening Good Neighbor Pharmacy and enhancing the role community pharmacy plays in the provision of health care. We absolutely believe that the innovation that this new relationship will inspire will drive the next generation of services to our community pharmacy customers, and we believe that this message is being understood and accepted by the marketplace.","Our institutional segment, including both hospitals and alternate sites, continues to perform very well. Our efforts to expand some of our best-in-class specialty capabilities into the hospital market to support physicians who treat oncology patients continue to gain traction as many of our large health system customers expand their outpatient offerings.","As the specialty market evolves, the breadth of our expertise is more important than ever. The collaborative approach we've deployed over the last few years, both internally and externally, drives us to utilize all the capabilities of ABC to meet evolving customer needs. Our work in this area is one of the best illustrations of how we can drive mutual value for our customers by leveraging our portfolio across different size of care.","Operating income in ABDC was down year-over-year as expected due to the decline in operating margin, which resulted from the implementation of the new large PBM contract, the loss of Topco and fewer significant generic launches available to offset that pressure in the quarter. As expected, trends in brand inflation, generic utilization and even generic price inflation continue to be strong. As I have mentioned previously, we have had very difficult comparisons on generic launches in fiscal 2013, but those improved in fiscal 2014. This was our first full quarter that all of our DCs were operating on SAP, and we are very pleased with the performance of the system and advanced business analytics that this system affords us. The SAP implementation was, from planning to completion, over 5 years of incredible effort by ABC associates. It is that system that has really placed us in a position to essentially double our volume over the next year or so, and I am incredibly grateful for the professional effort that so many people at ABC contributed to at the highest level that got us to this position today.","AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group revenues were up 5% in the quarter due to strong sales in ASD and Besse. As expected, our Oncology business slowed in the quarter on a year-over-year basis as physician practices continue to face economic challenges in the face of declining reimbursement rates. Specialty physicians continue to work through the significant reimbursement cuts that resulted from sequestration. And while all practices are challenged, the smaller practices are hit the hardest. We continue to work in Washington to help members of Congress and regulators at CMS and elsewhere to make sure they understand the full impact the cuts have had not just on physician impacts, but also on patient access. We believe that in order for the health care system to operate at optimum efficiency, health care providers must be fairly reimbursed for the services they provide to all payer categories. We also continue to believe that patients are best served in the community practice setting. Not only do patients tend to have better outcomes being treated in a dedicated specialty setting, but current data supports that the cost of care is lower in the community setting. We are hopeful that at a minimum, the sequestration cuts will be reversed in the current months. But at this time, it is difficult to know when or by what mechanism that would occur.","While Oncology Supply sales declined year-over-year, sales stabilized on a sequential basis. Fortunately, as Oncology sales have slowed, our other Specialty businesses have continued to grow above market by winning unique distribution opportunities and progress. These businesses do have somewhat lower margins than the Community Oncology business does, so there's been a mix shift towards lower margin business within ABSG, and their growth was not enough to overcome the decline in operating margin contribution from Oncology Supply. While the specialty market is changing and working to near-term challenges, the expertise and capabilities we've developed over the years and investments we've made help ensure that we are the premier partner for manufacturers of specialty products and for providers who administer specialty products to patients.","Turning now to the Other segment that is comprised of our manufactures services businesses, revenues were up 17% due in large part to contributions from World Courier, of which 1 month was not included in the prior year. Operating income was up 18%, driven in large part by good performance in World Courier. We continue to be very excited about the long-term potential for our manufacturer services businesses both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the global marketplace.","Looking ahead, we are still working through our detailed business planning process and will give our full fiscal 2014 guidance in our new fourth quarter call. As we have previously stated, we expect our new Walgreens contract to provide incremental revenues of $25 billion in fiscal 2014, and to contribute a net $0.20 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2014. As we on-board the Walgreens contract, we will see further operating margin degradation. But once we anniversary that impact, we expect to return to a model where we are able to meaningfully increase our operating margins on an annual basis.","There are many moving parts in late fiscal 2013 and 2014 in addition to activities and cost associated with on-boarding Walgreens. These tailwinds include more generic launches in fiscal 2014 versus 2013, better industry top line growth due to the generic calendar and the gradual influx of the uninsured into the health care system. The headwinds include unplanned expenses of at least $10 million in our distribution segment to comply with now pending track and trace regulations, and continued pressure in our Oncology business at the current run rate. This headwind could be mitigated if reimbursement rates improve. But it could also -- would be worse if low reimbursement rates persist and physician practices increasingly struggle with the economics.","Overall, our base business is solid, and we do not have any large contract renewals on the horizon. Our business also provides us with tremendous cash flow, and we anticipate that cash flows will be strongest in the second half of fiscal 2014. While ABDC has plenty on its plate at the moment, we continue to look for opportunities to invest in our platform to provide for sustainable long-term growth. We believe the scale and breadth of our offerings sets us apart in the industry and is a key driver of our future success. It is an exciting time to be a customer, supplier, associate, shareholder or other stakeholder in AmerisourceBergen. We have a great deal of work ahead of us, but I am confident that our associates will continue to bring innovative and market-leading solutions to all of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and that we will continue to meet the expectations that all of our partners have in us.","Now, Gary's turn.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As has been our practice, my comments on our financial results will be on a GAAP basis. As expected, we have 2 unusual material expense items that are negatively impacting our June 2013 quarterly results, the LIFO charge and the equity warrant expense.","Our LIFO charge was exceptionally high at $122 million, and the warrant expense was $36 million. As a reminder, our previous EPS guidance excluded these 2 items due to their variability and difficulty in forecasting. For clarity, I will provide additional comments this morning on our adjusted results, which will exclude the impact of these 2 noncash expenses.","We now have 9 months completed in our fiscal year 2013, and we're pleased with our progress in tracking to our expectations. The highlights for the June quarter include solid top line growth in our core drug business, very good operating performance in our World Courier business and excellent free cash flow of $681 million through the first 9 months, slightly ahead of our expectations and setting us up well as we prepare to implement the Walgreens contract.","Let's start our review of our quarterly results. Keep in mind that we sold our Canadian drug distribution business and our contract packaging business this quarter. Their operating results are reflected as discontinued in both the current year and in the revised financials for the prior year. In addition, this marks the last quarter that we have an incremental benefit from the World Courier acquisition in our financial results as we have now anniversaried the May 2012 acquisition date.","Revenues were $21.9 billion, up 13.3% percent compared to last year's quarter. Our revenue growth was primarily due to our large PBM contract that began last October, and a much smaller headwind from brand-to-generic conversions.","Gross profit decreased to $562 million due to the LIFO charge of $122 million that I mentioned previously. This charge represents 9 months of our anticipated full year or annual charge. As expected, this charge is material due to the substantial brand inventory build, over $1 billion, we will have in the fourth quarter as we prepare for the Walgreens business beginning in September. Based on current inflation and inventory mix estimates, we'd expect our Q4 LIFO charge to be in the $50 million range. Our gross profit also included about $6 million of antitrust litigation settlements received in the June quarter. Excluding the LIFO charge, our gross profit would've increased nearly $17 million or about 2.5% due to the 1 extra month of World Courier contributions of about $30 million. Excluding World Courier, our gross profit was down year-over-year due to lower contributions from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, total operating expenses were $428 million, up about 24%. Our operating expenses are impacted by the 1 extra month of World Courier's operations. Demonstrating our focus on expense management, our operating expenses for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment are up only 2% year-over-year, while revenues have increased significantly.","Incremental operating costs specifically to support the new Walgreens distribution contract were not meaningful this quarter. These costs, primarily labor and IT cost, will ramp up beginning in early Q4.","Included in GAAP operating expenses is warrant expense of $36 million. The current value of the warrants at June 30, 2013, as determined by an independent third party, was $467 million, which is an increase of about $153 million from the March 31 value. The increase in the warrant valuation is due to the increase in the ABC share price and also the increase in the ABC share price volatility assumption.","This quarter we also had special charges of about $20 million or an equivalent $0.05 negative EPS impact, primarily related to professional fees associated with completing our Walgreens and Alliance Boots transaction. Included in this $20 million amount is also a loss related to subleasing a closed distribution center below our current lease cost.","Operating income. Our operating income was $135 million. However, backing out the LIFO charge and the warrant expense, our adjusted operating income would have been $293 million or a decrease of about 10%. The decrease is due to lower gross profit in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and the additional onetime special charges that I just discussed.","Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, down by 34 basis points compared to last June quarter.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $18 million in the June quarter decreased about 23% compared to last year due to the debt that we paid off last September.","Income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was nearly 45%. However, our income tax rate is being negatively impacted by warrant expense. The current valuation of our warrants, the $467 million at June 30, 2013, that I referenced earlier, is in excess of our March 18 warrant valuation of $242 million, which approximates the amount of expense that we will be able to deduct for tax purposes. Any dollar amount in excess of the initial warrant valuation will not be deductible. The excess amount is considered a permanent tax difference.","On an adjusted basis, which means we are removing the nondeductible dollars associated with the warrants, our effective tax rate for the June 2013 quarter was 37.4%, which represents a tax provision of about $102 million.","This quarter, we did have a favorable tax adjustment related to the reversal of a reserve that coincided with our federal tax return filing. Excluding the impact of the warrants and any nondeductible tax amounts, we'd expect our full year fiscal 2013 tax rate now to be approximately 38% for continuing operations.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the June quarter was $0.27. On an adjusted basis, adjusting for LIFO, warrant expense and the negative tax rate impact, our diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.73, a decrease of about 1%.","Our EPS benefited from an 8% reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding versus the prior year's quarter. At June 30, 2013, we had just under 231 million shares outstanding.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the June quarter, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $21.5 billion, up 13% versus the same quarter last year. Growth at our Drug Company was approximately 16%. The majority of the increase was due to our new contract with our large PBM customer. This quarter, we expanded our brand business with our PBM customer as we added one new large brand manufacturer that the PBM previously self-distributed. This incremental business is at the typical margin for our PBM customer. We also had increased revenues from the Walgreens pilot programs. But this revenue basically offset the negative revenue impact from the Topco contract loss. Additionally, our top line growth clearly benefited from having a much smaller headwind from brand-to-generic conversions.","Our Specialty business grew a solid 5% year-over-year. We continued our pattern of excellent growth at our ASD, Besse Medical and ICS businesses. These 3 businesses were up a combined 16%. Our Oncology Supply business, down about 10%, continues to be challenged on a top line basis due to reimbursement pressures and the migration of business to the hospital setting, and also brand-to-generic conversions. These sales growth percentages are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we've communicated these growth rates in the past.","Total adjusted segment operating income decreased $20 million, or about 7%, to $287 million in the June quarter. Both Drug and Specialty had decreases in operating income year-over-year. Drugs decrease was due to lower contributions from our PBM contract and the loss of the Topco contract. We also had loss of a contribution from oral\/solid generic launches. These headwinds were mostly offset by better generic price appreciation.","In terms of Specialty, they had higher contributions directly related to the increased revenues at ASD, Besse Medical and ICS. However, these increases could not completely offset the decrease from our Oncology Supply business.","Moving to the Other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. Segment revenues were $467 million, an increase of 17% from in last year's quarter. The increase was primarily due to World Courier having 1 extra month of operations included in the June 2013 quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. However, looking at the World Courier revenues on an equivalent sales per day basis, their revenues increased about 10%, primarily due to additional contract wins.","Operating income for the Other segment increased 18% to $25 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was solely related to contributions from World Courier. This business had 1 extra month of operations compared to last year's quarter, but World Courier also had several new business wins and they managed expenses tightly. We expect World Courier to contribute $0.06 to $0.08 earnings in this fiscal year.","Our Consulting business had a decrease in operating income of about 8% primarily due to timing. A key program shifted to July this fiscal year versus being recognized in the June quarter last year.","Now, let's turn to cash flow and liquidity. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our free cash flow performance, $681 million for the 9-month period. This is just slightly ahead of last year, while absorbing a working capital increase on our new PBM contract. We ended June with a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion.","In the June quarter, we purchased about 2.1 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $116 million. Our share repurchases basically offset employee stock option exercises in the quarter. For the 9 months, we are now at $401 million of share repurchases, which is essentially what we said we'd buy back this year.","Moving to our hedging program. As a reminder, this program enables ABC to offset a reasonable amount of the anticipated share dilution, which will occur upon the exercise of the warrants. Earlier in the June quarter, we entered into 4 capped call options that gave ABC the right to purchase a specified number of shares from the investment bank in calendar 2016 and 2017 at agreed-upon or fixed prices. We will use proceeds from the exercise of the warrants to purchase these shares. At June 30, the investment bank has completed about 20% of the hedge, and we've incurred cost of roughly $43 million, of which we paid $28 million and accrued the remaining balance. For accounting purposes, the $43 million of hedging cost has been reported as a decrease against equity, similar to how we account for share repurchases. We expect the hedge to be completed by fiscal yearend. However, at any time, we can instruct the investment bank to adjust or end the hedging activities based on market conditions.","One final item before we get into 2013 guidance. As many of you know, we recently announced that we increased our liquidity by amending our senior credit and securitization facilities. With these 2 amended facilities, we have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, which enables us to meet short-term working capital demands from the new Walgreens contract, and most importantly, to increase longer-term flexibility as we now have liquidity available for 5 more years. We thank all of our partner banks that continue to support ABC.","Now, let's recap our fiscal 2013 guidance. EPS. Our full year non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations is now $3.06 to $3.11. Year-to-date, we are at an adjusted EPS of $2.35. Please remember that our range excludes 3 items: one, the LIFO charge for fiscal '13; two, the impact from warrant expense that we record in operating expenses; and three, the tax impact from the warrants as a portion of this expense is not deductible for tax purposes.","Revenue growth. Revenue growth remains in the 11% to 13% range from our revised fiscal 2012 revenues, which excluded our discontinued operations.","Operating income and margin. Excluding the impact from LIFO and warrants, we continue to expect our operating income will be down 3% to 5% for the year as compared to the revised fiscal '12 operating income. And our operating margin will decrease in the 24 to 29 basis point range from the revised fiscal '12 margin of 1.67%.","Free cash flow. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million, which reflects the significant working capital build to support the Walgreens contract. This also includes CapEx of about $240 million, of which about $50 million is to support our new Walgreens contract.","Share repurchases. As mentioned previously, for the 9 months, we stand at $401 million in share repurchases, which is essentially what we guided for the year. At this time, we expect to stay near this level due to short-term capital needs to support the Walgreens contract implementation, specifically inventory purchases and CapEx.","Now, before I wrap up, let me cover 3 key items related to our fiscal 2014 guidance. First, just to reconfirm, the incremental fiscal year 2014 guidance we gave relating to the Walgreens transaction, the net $0.20 EPS benefit, this amount excludes any accounting impact from LIFO and the warrants. Also, we expect the $0.20 to be mostly back-end-loaded in terms of our quarters because we are incurring startup expenses early and ramping the Walgreens generic revenues during the fiscal year.","The second item. As we look ahead to fiscal 2014, we plan to provide guidance and report our financial results on an adjusted basis in order -- in an effort to improve clarity and transparency. We will continue to report our GAAP results, but we will also report adjusted earnings. Our definition of adjusted EPS means we will exclude the following items: We will exclude the expense associated with the equity warrants, and this also includes backing out the negative tax impact from the portion of the expense that is nondeductible; we will exclude LIFO charges or credits; we will also exclude acquisition-related costs, which include intangible amortization. Any special onetime restructuring, litigation and severance expenses will also be excluded. And additionally, we will calculate our adjusted EPS using an adjusted diluted share count. This share count will exclude the accounting dilution resulting from the impact of the unexercised equity warrants.","This quarter, upon further accounting research and consultation, we determined that the fair value of the warrants, which is yet to be expensed, over $400 million at June 30, should be included as assumed proceeds in the treasury stock method calculation. This inclusion can reduce or actually eliminate the dilution impact of the warrants, which are currently in the money. As a result, the warrants were anti-dilutive for the quarter and for the 9 months ended June 30, 2013. We believe that using an adjusted share count is appropriate as the share count calculation is complex and also has a high degree of variability. This will ensure a consistent approach with investors when calculating and forecasting our share count going forward.","And finally, the third item regarding our guidance. With the on-boarding of the Walgreens contract, as we have discussed in the past, we will have a sizable working capital investment. We expect our working capital to improve the second half of fiscal 2014. Because of this, we'd expect that our share repurchases will be much greater the second half of the fiscal year to coincide with our working capital improvement.","As I wrap up my comments, let me say that we are pleased with our results through the 9 months. We've accomplished a significant amount this fiscal year with our ABC team, and we are well positioned for our last 3 months to meet our expectations for the full year. Thank you for your continued interest in ABC. Now, here's Barbara for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Stephen.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Tim, you mentioned that you had some more business with, I guess, your biggest PBM customer in the quarter, and there were some pilot programs going on with Walgreens. We got a lot of questions about gross margins in the quarter. Could you just sort of convey where gross margins came in versus your expectations and if they were pressured, I guess, incrementally by the Walgreens pilots, as well as the extra business to, I assume, with Express?","Steven H. Collis","Yes, thanks, Tom. Yes, sure. I would say that externally, our gross profit margins were probably a little bit lower than what people expected, but internally, they were in line with what we thought. Again, we had a mix shift within our Drug Company; 2 of our large customers, the PBM and Walgreens, both had incremental revenues this quarter, and again, at lower margins. We also had a little bit of a mix shift in our Specialty business, the 3 businesses I called out, their revenues are growing faster versus Oncology. So I mean overall, pretty much in line with what we expected. But again, I think the important thing is we managed our expenses really well this quarter, and from an operating margin standpoint, we're right in line with the range that we gave earlier in the year. And remember, earlier in the year, we guided down 24 to 29 basis points. So from an operating margin standpoint, we're right in line with that.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Steve, I think in your prepared remarks, you sort of alluded to the idea that conversations with customers were going well. You also said you've been meeting with manufacturers. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on the things that the customers are focused on, as well as what the manufacturers are focused on with you and, I guess, any update or thoughts on sort of the timing of benefiting from the joint venture with Walgreens on the purchasing side?","Steven H. Collis","Yes, thanks, Tom. So a couple of things. Just this thing we started with manufacturers, we actually met with, probably, our largest manufacturer partner last week. And I think just a lot of interest in doing more programs at the retail level. A lot of acknowledgment that the scale and reach that we have has really been greatly enhanced intrigue on the international side. On the customer side, the idea really is strengthening and enhancing the role of community pharmacy. And again, the first time that Greg Wasson and Stefano Pessina and I discussed this transaction, it came down to how do we accomplish that, what are the different attributes that all of our companies have that can help us accomplish that. And 4 months into it, obviously, the focus in the Drug Company has to be in the contract implementation. But we're very mindful of the fact that our customers are expecting to get strategic benefits from this transaction, so we're looking at third-party contracting, we're looking at clinical platforms, we're looking at front-store products, even some of the very advanced services that Walgreens has, the Take Care Clinics could reach in some of those into the community setting. So all of that is very positive, and we're thrilled about the collaboration that we're seeing. On international side, Tim and I were in London with the Alliance Boots folks. Just a talented, successful team of professionals that we think we can do a lot of good work with over the next couple of years.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, I just want to follow up with some of the comments you were making when you were discussing the accretion from the deal. I think I heard you correctly, you seem to suggest that the accretion next year will be more back-end-loaded, and I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on why that's the case. I mean, obviously, the branded revenues are going to roll on pretty soon. Is it more a function of the timing when generics roll on or is it more of a function of the timing of the benefit from the JV?","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Glen, and good morning. No, clearly, it's related to the ramp-up. We're ramping up now, in July, we're starting the hiring process for our distribution centers. So ramp-up expenses earlier, and then we start with the brand business. And that generic business ramps up over time, so over the fiscal year. So again, a lot of it's timing: expenses earlier and the generics later. And that's really why kind of looking at it from a high level, we expect the earnings to be better the second half of the year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe if I could just sort of follow up. Steve, there's been a fair amount of concern about the company's ability to ultimately get much better generic pricing from this JV. And so I'm kind of curious, 4 months after the deal's been announced, are you still comfortable with sort of the level of discounts you'd be able to get through your generic purchasing? I mean, how much visibility do you have into what you think your new pricing will look like at this point? So I'm just trying to gauge how comfortable you are in terms of the ability to garner those savings.","Steven H. Collis","It's complicated, right? And I'm really not being evasive. We've got a lot of work to do. Again, we came in to this relationship as the third largest entity, and again, we're not really a party to the JV that was already established between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and we've been buying to that, we're just the third contracting party in that joint venture. So we have a lot of confidence, we've spent a lot of time, we would have a significant role in the joint venture, including consigned associates. But I think our goal is to be very successful in the long term. Most of the parties on the other side, the generic manufacturers, are large public companies. They have their own forecasts. Again, we'll be contracting for 13% to 15% of the world's generics volume. So we've been very thoughtful and deliberate, and the game is to be successful in the long term. And we are more convinced than ever that, that is going to be accomplished.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There are some concerns highlighted last quarter relative to the Oncology business, and now, you're making mention of softness related to the oncology reimbursement landscape again this quarter. Growth overall for ABSG seemed to be up sequentially in year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about the overall Specialty segment or the overall ABSG segment in the back half of this year and into next year. I know you guys had laid out kind of annual ranges at your Investor Day. Any comments relative to those ranges of how we should be thinking about that segment going forward?","Steven H. Collis","Again, I think we would -- looking at how we can communicate this, so Oncology, our traditional Oncology segment is really sales through Oncology Supply to community oncologists. And that clearly, as we announced, has been 10% down this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. That's not really -- we don't believe it's through loss of market share. It really is that, that some smaller practices have sold to larger practices, many of which are our customers, and we sometimes take -- obviously, larger customers get a better deal, and a smaller customer is more challenged by the ASD formulary. So that has been some of the impact. There also have been some practices that sell to health systems. In about 1 in 3 cases, we would be the wholesaler there. So we do benefit, but again, that's not as high a margin as we have in Oncology business based on the ION and Oncology Supply portfolio. But the other trend that I think is worth noting is that oncology products are often in different formulations now. Many of them are oral; they service through specialty pharmacies. That's a very strong segment and our ultimate cash segment within the Drug Company, but also in specialized programs that we do, say in our ASD and in non-oncology, in our Besse Medical segment. And these are very close manufacture programs often with registries and unique data components to them. And I think we've highlighted in the release, we have strong capabilities in Specialty and you've seen that come through with -- in our above market growth in our ASD and Besse businesses, in particular, and some unique manufacture programs in our ICS business, which, by the way, we think we've got a good opportunity to take some of those programs internationally.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Bob, I would say that your question about the margins, the operating margins that we put up for Investor Day, we're still in the range but we're priced to the lower end of that range for Specialty, and again, a lot of that is the mix shift right to the lower margin businesses, ASD, Besse Medical, ICS. But also, remember back in the March quarter, we guided down on our range, we kind of moved down to the lower end. So again, that $0.03 or $0.04 movement last March was really pegged to Oncology, right? So that's probably what you could see maybe going into next year in terms of kind of a little bit of a headwind until reimbursement improves or until we kind of anniversary because again, we -- that was March of last year. So until we anniversary, that's potentially what you're looking at, again, as the headwind for next year.","Steven H. Collis","And it's also important, Bob, just final point, I know we've talked a lot about this, but we're not backing off anything in our Oncology business. Tim and I were down with the oncology guys a couple of weeks ago. I think our customers need us more than ever. There's an opportunity to carry on adding incremental value then. We're very committed to being the leader provider to oncology practices as we have been for well over a decade now.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. No, that's truly helpful. And then just one housekeeping question, Tim. You mentioned 3 major adjustments to when you give fiscal '14 guidance, and I'm sure I can go back and look at the transcript, but I just want to be clear on the warrants. Is the change there really for us to think about the warrants as not impacting the adjusted P&L at all at this point, the expense will be removed? And then any dilution that could have happened will also now be excluded? Am I thinking about that right?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, you're thinking about that correctly, right. It impacts operating expense, it impacts -- the warrants, impact the tax rate, and of course, the accounting. There's an impact from the accounting dilution on the share count, and we're stripping that out, again, because of complexity and variability in our share price. And a big part of stripping that out, too, is the fact that we've implemented a hedge program which will address the share dilution. So that's why we feel like it's appropriate to back that out and not impact in terms of this interim period when the warrants are unexercised.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tim, just to be clear on the D&A, are we just going to carry forward the current run rate here without any incremental inputs from the Walgreens, Alliance Boots aspects? Or are you looking at backing out some historical deal amortization as well?","Tim G. Guttman","No, I think, Bob -- Bob, thanks for the question. No, I think we will -- historically, the number's not that significant, so we are thinking about backing out all of it, the historical also, and it's probably about $0.01 a quarter. Most of it -- most of that though is from the last 2 deals, World Courier and TheraCom, but there is a little bit extra that we felt like we should back out.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And obviously, there were some news from WellPoint today that the Amerigroup contract's going to move earlier. Any thoughts on sizing that one as yet or too soon for you guys to make a guess there?","Steven H. Collis","No, too soon, and again, the margin is not that significant for us, Bob. But certainly, we hope our PBM customer is a very strong grower, and you've seen that in the revenue enjoyed in the Drug Company this quarter.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the significant margin expansion opportunity post fiscal year '14. So if you can just help us with how we model the progression for '14, '15 and '16. If you could quantify for us kind of like the step down in margin in fiscal year '14, and then what should we expect in fiscal year '15? I know in the last conference call, you guys talked about high single digit, I think it was 8 to 10 basis points, expansion in '15. So at this point, are you still sticking with that, or given that some time has passed, you are seeing some potential upside to that number?","Steven H. Collis","Well, we're really deep in our fiscal year '14 planning process, and I think you'd see from the caliber of Tim's comments here, we have a lot more moving financial pieces than we have historically have. As somebody once said, it's not as easy as ABC anymore. But we do really -- I think the we had talked a lot prior to the announcement of the Walgreens-Alliance Boots deal about improving our operating margin in fiscal year '14, and we relayed the focus on that. Then came along this transaction and $25 billion in incremental revenue, and a lot of the top line revenue's really brand, and we're implementing the generics over time. And part of that is just not entirely known how we will implement the generics. Clearly, once we anniversary the whole contract, it will be better for us on a margin perspective. We also are -- and we're working through this, of course. When you bring on a contract of this size, some of the expenses that will be taken on right away in September, but also in the first couple of months, will probably be enhanced and then will settle down over time. So I think just to give you the answer you're probably looking for, our expectation right now is that in fiscal year '15, we would see a high single digits operating margin increase. That's where we'll be guiding to. But we're deep in fiscal year '14 now, so we hesitate to get too explicit about fiscal year '15. But Tim's probably the better guy to ask about this though.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Steve, I would definitely agree. I mean, '14 will take a little bit of a step back with all that incremental revenue coming on board. For '15, we definitely will have margin expansion at least. And again, I say at least high single digits. And I would expect that to get better after that, again, as we kind of ramp up and enjoy some of the benefits of this transaction. That would be our internal expectation.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So when -- again, just when we think about the step down in '14, just because we're trying to kind of like figure out how to model this, should we assume a similar magnitude of the step down that you saw when you brought on the Express business given that Walgreens, yes, it's a bigger contract, but it does have both branded and generics, or should the impact be greater than that?","Steven H. Collis","No, Ricky, that's a tough one, right, because we're still in our planning process, I mean. But I don't think the step down will be as great as what we had this year with Express, right? Because again, next year, you have both the brand and some generics coming on board.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question around the JV purchasing opportunity from 2 fronts. One, Steve, is there any way to quantify what you expect the synergies or savings to be over time? And then secondly, when you talk about your ProGen, can you talk about what your penetration rates are today and where you think they could go based on this new opportunity around pricing on the JV? Do you see a lot of opportunity in your existing book of business where you can really increase that penetration rate because you're not there today? How should we think about that?","Steven H. Collis","Lisa, I mean, there's a lot of interest, and we don't believe -- a lot of interest in exactly what the contribution will be from the JV, and we're really, as we said -- it's complicated, right? We're buying from a Swiss entity, it's a new relationship, it's a groundbreaking relationship. So we really feel like we're giving enough guidance. We feel like that $0.20 that we've talked about for next year is much as we're comfortable saying right now. And clearly, the benefit will be much more enhanced in fiscal year '15 when we're distributing all the generics. So I think that's a lot of about what we said and -- on that front. Your second question was around ProGen. We do believe that this is going to strengthen ProGen. I think almost every customer inherently recognizes that not only ourselves, but the whole wholesaler industry has been a good part of the community pharmacy. From our perspective, those community pharmacies and all the customers that buy generics from us have always been essential to the success of our business, and that probably even becomes more so because we believe we're going to have really terrific programs to bring them, greater product portfolios, not only in generics, but in brands store, and also the non-purchasing programs. So I think, as Tom had asked earlier, and I think almost every customer inherently recognizes that. And on Friday, I'm giving a speech to a couple of thousand of our stores and certainly will be emphasizing that. And I think our customers really understand that, and the good news is manufacturers also recognize that this is a truly unique partnership that has got a lot of legitimacy to it because of equity pieces, because of the tenure distribution contract, and the marketplace is accepting that this is a new groundbreaking opportunity for them and for us as well.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But Steve, is there any way, I mean, even just to quantify this in any way, is it greater than 50% buy for generics from you today on the independent pharmacy side? Is it 90%? Just trying to quantify what that incremental opportunity would be going forward.","Steven H. Collis","So we service thousands of stores on some basis. We have about 4,500 in the Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Those customers are the ones that we really like to focus on. In fact, we've got some data, we have a couple of customers that are celebrating 29 years with us. They will be calling out on Friday [indiscernible] . So those customers tend to be very compliant. I think we've seen some data that show that they're buying over 90% of their formulary products from us. We want to get all customers today, when we meet with any independent pharmacy that's an AmerisourceBergen customer, we try to get them to be in the Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. I believe, and I believe Tom will prove me right, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy is only going to be greater enhanced. The actual program is going to be stronger. So if you're an independent pharmacy and you believe that ABC is a good partner, I think that there's a lot of logic to you being more compliant rather than less, and more interested in becoming a part of ABC and a greater customer than you have had in the past. And that's going to be our message. And honestly, I haven't heard anyone that dispels that notion that I've had. In fact, it's being understood. It's very logical and compelling, frankly.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. John Ransom of Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","As we think about your Specialty business, the way it's -- the current run rate, can you help us understand the relative contribution of Oncology versus the relative contribution of everything else, both in terms of revenue and profits, just to get some kind of idea of how much is growing versus how much is under pressure?","Steven H. Collis","John, I've just said, I know we got you under the wire, I think we do have to move you up next year, but it's -- you've always really been interested in our Specialty business, we appreciate that. And Tim, do you want to comment on the risk [ph] of contribution?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, we don't -- John, I mean, I appreciate the question, but we really don't give specific operating income information. But from a revenue standpoint, when you look at, again, the businesses, the non-Oncology businesses, Oncology Supply, right, so non-Oncology Supply, they're probably about 60% of the revenue and Oncology Supply is about 40%.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And would Oncology be higher or lower average margin in your Specialty?","Tim G. Guttman","I would say that Oncology is slightly higher. Again, those other businesses, those other businesses are higher volume, higher growth, but slightly, slightly lower margins.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it wouldn't be completely","off the reservation to think about half of the business growing and half of it being under pressure from a profit standpoint, something in that ballpark.","Steven H. Collis","Well, again, we were really -- we were flat, our second to third quarter in our Oncology Supply revenues. Again, some of the reasons we've got such good growth at our ASD and Besse divisions, which -- well, not Besse, but ASD in particular is that they are doing a lot of oral oncology drugs. So I think it's -- we've had this theme for a while that our Oncology business is really integrated throughout the company, including in our health systems, alternate site business and our ASD business would be 3 of the other beneficiaries of a strong oncology portfolio, they're just not always in our B [ph] drugs.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I mean I think that's -- I mean, that's the key point, right? We're down, when we talk about results versus last year, we're down. But the good news is, sequentially here, we've stabilized and we're pretty flat in terms of Oncology. So we think that's very encouraging.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one other quick one. When we think about next year, I know you're not giving guidance, I know you talked about $0.20 from the Walgreen, does that include also the benefits of the JV? Or is that strictly the Walgreen wholesale contract as a standalone?","Steven H. Collis","No, it's both for 2014. But again, we expect that it will get better in 2015, and that's why we're fairly comfortable and...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I'm sorry if you said this, but you'll start doing the generic piece -- have you said -- what did you say, back half of the year, you'll start doing the generics? Have you nailed that down? I may have missed it.","Steven H. Collis","No, we haven't -- it's -- so we got the brand starting September 1. We expect to start on the generic distribution for calendar 2014. And then we really have the whole year to complete that. We'd hope to maybe go a bit quicker, but we have -- there's no hurry. Again, it's a 10-year contract so there's no hurry, and we'll go very steady. I'd tell you that just having visited a lot of the customers' stores, there's tremendous excitement about this program.

This next quarter is going to be truly a historic momentous quarter for us as we implement probably one of the largest contracts in the history of our industry. It's important then, as some of the questions have come up, that we will deliver superbly for all of our customers and we'll meet the high expectations that all of them have for us, including this new Walgreens contract.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's Earnings Conference Call covering our first quarter fiscal year 2013 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2012.","Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered strong solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013. Our revenues were up 6% to $21.5 billion, and earnings per share were up 13% to $0.69. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.","Importantly, the acquisitions we made last year contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter, expanding our positions in the fastest-growing segments of the market and further strengthening our foundation for sustainable growth.","AmerisourceBergen plays a significant role in an essential sector of the health care economy and is an important contributor to a growing and vibrant pharmaceutical industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day last month, we continue to expect that demographic trends and health care reform initiatives will expand coverage to the uninsured and should drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years.","In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as expanded indications for existing drugs should further contribute to improving pharmaceutical sales trends. At the same time, cost efficiencies are expected by both government and private payers, and AmerisourceBergen's role in driving efficiency and innovation in the pharmaceutical supply chain is becoming ever more important.","With our diverse customer mix, we are fortunate to work with many participants in the health care market. We deal with both large and small provider and manufacture customers and believe we offer a compelling value proposition for all our chosen customer segments.","Our portfolio positions us to benefit in unique ways from health reform initiatives, as organic industry growth drives demand across all our businesses. For example, our Manufacturer Services business helps life-saving new therapies come to market quicker and more efficiently and helps ensure that patients have complete understanding of their reimbursement options, including manufacturer resources that may be available to them. As our provider and retail customers face the challenge of both cost pressures and increased demand, our goal is for AmerisourceBergen to be seen as an increasingly important resource in making their health care practice and businesses run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellence in patient care.","Historically, we have taken a very customer-centric approach to adding and developing our business lines. Simply put, we want to provide services that will be valued and paid for by our customer base. This guiding principle has been the driver of our long-term success and has helped direct our internal and external investments. As the health care industry faces great change and complexities in the future, AmerisourceBergen will continue to use our key strengths to drive growth by delivering important and innovative value to our customers.","While we face some headwinds in fiscal 2013, the resilience of our business and the investments we've made over the last several quarters give me confidence in the future prospects for our business and in our ability to meet our financial and business goals for fiscal year 2013. Furthermore, with the addition of the World Courier business and an increasingly global mindset of some of our manufacturer partners, we see opportunities to expand some of our fastest-growing lines of business into certain international markets.","Turning now to our business units. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment had strong revenue growth, but gross and operating margins were challenged by difficult year-over-year comparisons, particularly with respect to generics and by changing customer mix in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. Operating income was down slightly in the quarter but in line with expectations.","The Drug Company had strong revenue growth in the quarter, up 5% as we successfully implemented our new contract with our largest customer. We are very pleased to be the channel partner to one of the leading U.S. health care companies, and we look forward to growing with them for many years to come.","In addition, we continue to see very good performance in our hospital customer base. These targeted programs and services we deliver to hospitals have helped us solidify our market share in that segment over the last several years. And excluding government facilities, we believe we are now the market leader in pharmaceutical distribution to hospitals.","On the retail side, revenues were down year-over-year due to the loss of a food and drug combination group purchasing organization. However, our 4,700-member strong Good Neighbor Pharmacy network continues to play a key role in helping our independent customers remain competitive in the marketplace. I believe that independent retail pharmacies play an increasingly important role in the health care landscape today. Patients prefer choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions, and the retail pharmacists in our network are among the most easily accessible health care professionals in their communities and very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs.","Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly, with 22 distribution center conversions complete and only 3 remaining to be done in the March quarter of fiscal 2013. We made a significant investment in SAP, and our associates have spent countless hours working to ensure a successful transition. We take a great deal of pride in what we have been able to accomplish so far. And while we still have some work ahead, including the decommissioning of our old system, we have already begun to reap some benefits from our new enterprise system.","Our Canadian distribution operations have faced some difficulties implementing a large new retail contract in a market that is undergoing significant reimbursement challenges, particularly with respect to generics. We are disappointed with Drug Canada's performance, and we have several initiatives underway to improve results in Canada, but it will take some time. Importantly, our Canadian Specialty business continues to perform well as it works closely with our U.S. Specialty company and key manufacturers to implement successful joint programs in Canada.","Collaboration with AmerisourceBergen has been the key to our ability to continue to drive innovative solutions. As specialty products become more important and their usage is more widespread throughout the health care spectrum, it is essential that we capitalize on the strengths and expertise we have throughout our business. For example, as the oncology market evolves, we are taking concrete steps to ensure that we were meeting the changing needs of cancer care providers. Whether care is administered in the hospital or in a community practice setting, we want to make certain that our customers have access to our market-leading oncology programs and services. In light of this trend, we recently launched our oncology service line, which simplifies oncology purchasing and financial management for varying sites of care.","In addition, we continue to support oral oncolytic products through innovative offerings that are now an essential part of the commercialization strategy for oral cancer products. As the oncology market changes, AmerisourceBergen continues to remain the leader in providing world-class solutions for our customers and streamline pathways to help get life-saving therapies to patients.","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had very strong revenues in the quarter, up 10%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics, blood products, vaccine and physician office distribution businesses. Oncology is a cornerstone of ABSG, but we are also an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any physician-administered product launched into the marketplace. In addition, our Specialty Group collaborates with our Consulting businesses to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise.","The scale and breadth of our Specialty business and the services that support it make it a true differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. Our expertise is what we believe will help make us a world leader as specialty markets get established outside the U.S.","Turning now to our Manufacturer Services business. AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter, with both TheraCom and the legacy businesses performing well as demand for their services continues to increase. Our market-leading position in manufacturer support programs and our proven expertise in both specialty and primary care products differentiate our business and provides tremendous value to manufacturers. Our unique expertise in demonstrating product value, maximizing patient access and improving adherence are unmatched, and more importantly, essential to the success of new products and the sustainability of more mature products.","We continue to make progress in the integration of World Courier, and we believe they will meet their financial and operational objectives for the year. In addition, we continue to be very excited about the opportunities we see to build on the strength of manufacturer relationships we have in the U.S. and expand into other markets.","I want to take a moment to personally thank Wayne Heyland, who will be retiring as President of World Courier. Over his 30 years with the company, Wayne and his team built a business that is the global leader in clinical trial logistics. We also very much appreciate Wayne's efforts to ensure World Courier made a smooth transition to becoming part of AmerisourceBergen. We congratulate Wayne on his career and wish him all the best in his retirement.","Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2013, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.16, an increase of 11% to 14% over fiscal 2012. Looking further ahead, we expect to see organic growth improve as the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients begin to enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals.","In addition, generic conversions improve over the next years. And of course, there is a chance that biosimilars may come to market in that timeframe. Of course, we remain open to future acquisitions, particularly in the specialty and consulting areas, but no further acquisitions are contemplated in our guidance.","Before I turn it over to Tim for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future, because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. As I stated earlier, we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, and we've positioned ourselves well to benefit from the fastest-growing areas of the market. Importantly, we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and in opportunities we see for sustainable growth in our future.","Here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid first quarter fiscal 2013. We are tracking well to our expectations for the full year.","The highlights this quarter: Very good top line growth at the Drug Company as we on-boarded our new PBM customer; low double-digit generic revenue growth also at the Drug Company; above-market revenue growth at both Specialty and Consulting and progress integrating World Courier.","Let's start our review of first quarter results. Revenues were $21.5 billion, up nearly 6% compared to last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were up by 5%, and Specialty revenues were up a very strong 10%. Our revenues were also helped by World Courier, our second full quarter of reporting their results. Gross profit was approximately $672 million in the quarter, up 15% from last December, with a gross margin of 3.13%. Our World Courier acquisition contributed roughly $70 million of that increase in the current quarter. Our gross profit also benefited from approximately $12 million due to 3 antitrust litigation settlements.","Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, operating expenses were $385 million, up about 27%. This amount includes $65 million related to the operating cost of World Courier. Excluding these expenses, our comparable operating expenses would have been $320 million, an increase of about $17 million or a change of roughly 6%. About 60% of that increase is due to a higher cost structure in our Canadian drug distribution business to support a higher revenue base. We are working aggressively on a number of initiatives to reduce cost in that business.","Operating income of $287 million in the quarter increased about 2%. Our operating margin was 1.34%, down 5 basis points compared to last December quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we expect our operating income growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. Our generic comparisons get somewhat easier, and we start to realize benefits from a number of our internal initiatives, including steps we're taking to optimize field operations and our corporate organization.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $19 million in the December quarter decreased 17% compared to last year as a result of paying down debt back in September 2012.","Moving to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate in the current quarter was 39.6%. As discussed last quarter, we continue to have operating losses in our Canadian drug distribution business, and as a result, are no longer able to record a foreign tax benefit. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the current December quarter was $0.69, an increase of $0.08 or 13% over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from a 10% reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding versus the prior year. At December 31, 2012, we had about 230 million shares outstanding.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the December quarter, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total revenues were $21.1 billion, up by about 5% versus the same quarter last year. The increase was due to 2 primary drivers: One, on-boarding our PBM customer; and two, significantly above-market growth in our non-oncology specialty businesses. Our strong top line growth for both brand and generics offset a sizable quarter-over-quarter headwind from blockbuster brand drugs converting to lower-price generics.","Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit increased about $7 million when comparing the first quarter 2013 to the same quarter last year. And our gross profit margin decreased 9 basis points to 2.65%. The $12 million of antitrust income is included in this segment's gross profit. Excluding the antitrust income, the segment gross profit decreased due primarily to the headwind from the decreased margin on our large PBM contract. Although we had a headwind in the Drug Company from a low number of generic launches, our overall generic revenue growth helped to mostly offset this headwind amount. The segment's operating expenses increased to approximately $13 million or 5%. The majority of the increase is due to our Canadian drug distribution business. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to review their cost structure.","Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income decreased 2% to $269 million in the first quarter 2013. The core drug U.S. business was flat, while the Canadian distribution business continued to incur operating losses. Our specialty business was down slightly, due to the impact of lower contributions from oncology generic drugs, offset, in part, by the solid growth in our Besse, ASD and ICS businesses.","Moving to the Other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. Segment revenues increased over $200 million, the majority of which came from World Courier. During the quarter, we incurred about $4 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangibles in connection with the World Courier and TheraCom acquisitions. Operating income increased $11 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is related to contributions from both Consulting and World Courier.","Switching gears, I'd like to comment on our AndersonBrecon business that we previously announced we're selling. The process continues to move through due diligence. We expect to close in a timely manner. The business had very good financial performance in the current quarter. We continue to make the right capital investments in the business to ensure their financial success.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows. Capital expenditures were $57 million for the current quarter and included the purchase of our Sacramento distribution center. We now own all of our large greenfield DCs, which are considered strategic assets. In the current quarter, we used about $300 million of cash.","Historically, our first quarter of the year is our most challenging quarter from a cash generation standpoint. Impacts to this quarter were: One, we had our seasonal inventory build; two, our PBM customer had their new level of AR established, and this AR balance is the result of higher purchases and also, less favorable terms than our previous PBM contract; and three, slightly lower cash collections due to the timing of how the last day of December fell this year.","Our cash balance of about $400 million at December 31 is low by historical standards. However, as we cycle through our seasonally high inventory balance and we generate operating cash flow throughout the remainder of the year, our cash balance will return to a more normalized amount.","During the current quarter, we bought back about $285 million of shares. We are confident of our continued ability to generate cash, and we took advantage of market conditions to purchase additional shares. We have about $560 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our philosophy has consistently been to upsize returns to shareholders if we haven't otherwise deployed our capital and when market conditions permit.","Now let's turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. EPS. Our GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations remains unchanged at a range of $3.06 to $3.16. Even though Q2 is our highest EPS contributor for the year, we continue to guide that our second half of the fiscal year will be stronger than the first half in terms of total EPS contribution. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain relatively unchanged, revenue growth in the 6% to 9% range; our operating margin will decrease in the high-single, low double-digit basis point range; and free cash flow in the range of $750 million to $850 million, which includes CapEx of $180 million. And finally, we have increased our share repurchase expectation to $400 million in fiscal 2013.","Let me finish by reiterating, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and we're off to a solid start for the year. Thank you for your time today and your continued interest in ABC.","Now here's Barbara for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, John.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, just first, on the Specialty side, you mentioned it was a very good quarter. It was better than we were looking for. Can you talk about some of the drivers there besides specific business lines, maybe, are you taking market share or are there newer products that are driving that?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think, there's a couple of things, Tom. Thanks for the question. We're doing a lot of specialized manufacturer programs that supports that, oral cancer and a few products like that, that are growing above market. And sometimes those are very limited access programs, with just 1 or 2 participants, so we benefit as those products really grow and expand. And I think we've always really invested in our non-oncology businesses in Specialty. And certainly, you're seeing our ASD blood plasma vaccine business do very well. ICS, our third-party logistics and specialized manufacturer support services, distribution services company, do very well, as well as our oral oncology programs. So just again, it's a very strong portfolio, and we benefited from, I think, that unique portfolio that we have there. Also, I would point out, very strong performance by our Besse division, particularly in the ophthalmology area, where we have probably even a higher market share than we have in oncology.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Okay. And then just on the follow-on there. I guess, obviously, you reiterate the EPS guidance. Just wondering sort of how you're thinking about the moving parts at this point. In the quarter, you got the benefit of the settlement. You're going to have the share repurchases that are a little higher. On the other side, it seems that tax rates are a little higher. What are you thinking about as the key variables and I guess, just your thoughts on guidance in general at this point?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Tom, thanks. It's early in the year. We've got a long runway to go here, a lot of moving parts, a lot can happen in terms of the pricing environment, price inflation, we have to work through and see how that turns out for the remainder of the year. We kept our guidance. We want to get a few more months certainly under our feet here. And the other thing, too, is we've got a couple of generic launches coming up, one in Specialty that are both important to our year. Generic launches are dynamic. You never know if they're going to launch on time. So again, I would just say that it's early. And as we work through the year, we continuously look at our guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just looking at the first quarter experience, where the cash flow from operations was down and the CapEx have been higher, dividend's higher. Your free cash flow guidance for the year then suggests a much more dramatic ramp than we were looking for. You obviously didn't raise EPS guidance. So is it simply all inventory balances that will drive this? Or is there a change to the Express Scripts receivable that Tim mentioned?","Tim G. Guttman","No, Bob. This is Tim. No, I mean, we kind of established that base for Express Scripts. I would say, again, the first quarter is a pretty high inventory balance. We'll see that come down. Typically, the change in inventory between quarters 1 and 2 can be $600 million, $700 million. And by the time we get to the end of the year, we think we'll -- we have focus on some internal initiatives here, and we think we can really get that inventory balance down by the end of the year.","Operator","And we go to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, in your prepared remarks, you seem to suggest that the acquisitions contributed meaningfully to your results. Could you maybe give us a sense for how World Courier Group, in particular, maybe TheraCom, are performing relative to your expectations? When you did those deals, you laid out some specific accretion estimates for World Courier Group of $0.06 to $0.10. Are we kind of in that ballpark or are we doing a little bit better or worse?","Steven H. Collis","Well, first of all, I think we're getting really used to reporting, I think, again, it's just 1 quarter. We really, that $0.06 to $0.10 guidance was for the whole year, and we're very comfortable. I'd tell you that World Courier has added a lot to ABC. Certainly, as we consider the international platform, we have really been surprised at the quality of their people. I think we've got a really good opportunity to -- on the business development side to look at that strong offering we have with the ICS and ASD businesses in the U.S, so we're very pleased. We think they also have some unique opportunities in the marketplace because of some of the competitive environments. So it's meeting expectations. I think we've had a bit of focus on getting them used to being a part of AmerisourceBergen public accounting and the cash flow requirements and the cash reporting that we have. But now, we definitely are looking forward to a strong resumption of business development and we're bullish on the business. TheraCom, I mean, that was really an excellent addition into our Consulting Services business. We're expecting about $0.05 to $0.06 accretion from that, and that's right on track. TheraCom is actually -- it's a little bit harder to identify because it's so integrated now into the core Lash operations. And as you would expect, we had similar positions there and similar systems, so there's a much deeper integration there. So -- but I'd tell you that the leaders of our Consulting business couldn't be more thrilled to have this. And it's also really helped us with program management. We have a very strong hub of operations now in Pittsburgh and just outside D.C. So both of them have really strengthened our business. I mean, Tim, anything you want to add on the financial side?","Tim G. Guttman","No, I think we're tracking well. I mean, we're really pleased with the progress we're making. We said on the World Courier, we said that the base business is doing well. It could be a little bit slower for business development ramp-up, which we guided to when we did the acquisition, but they're on track. And again, we think there are some opportunities to take some market share hopefully later as we progress, so we're very optimistic.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, maybe if I could just ask you one quick follow-up. There's obviously a couple of big RFPs in the marketplace right now. And I'm kind of curious, are you bidding on all those opportunities? Or are you seeing anything in the marketplace that would make you cautious at all with respect to pricing or any sort of commentary around the competitive landscape?","Steven H. Collis","I mean, again, we just reported revenues of $21.5 billion, so we definitely are a big company. And we really do like to serve large and small customers, so we think we're of the size and scale that we -- we definitely, anyone that is interested in supply chain should speak to AmerisourceBergen and we should speak to them. But we're always going to bid responsibly on contracts. As you know, that's what you should have come to expect from us. We certainly consider the customer growth. We consider the positioning within our portfolio. We consider cash flow very importantly. So all of these are what we consider when we bid. And honestly, we're seeing a very stable but competitive contracting process. And we start to probably talk a bit earlier to customers, our own customers in the renewal contract cycle. But other than that, I'd say everything is pretty much steady as she goes.","Operator","And we'll go to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just on the Canadian business, it looks like reimbursement in Canada has been challenged for some time. It sounds like you're seeing some increased expenses against lower sales, and it looks like you're still operating at a loss there. I was wondering just what steps specifically you could take to start to turn things around there? And then is there any timeline we should be thinking about around the Canadian business?","Steven H. Collis","Well, Bob, thanks very much. We got a little bit surprised, among other things, I think, particularly by the generic reimbursement. So when we started off, when we started really bidding on this large contract and looking at expanding into a national footprint there, which is expensive, and relatively small populations in the middle of the country, we probably got really surprised by how quickly the reimbursement changed. I mean, we went from 50% of brand to 25% to 20%, and then that really spread throughout the country probably even a lot quicker than we expected. When we implemented the contract, some of the mix surprised us, but we've worked through that. We are taking a lot of expense out. Obviously, we have discussions with our customers going on as well, making sure that we adapt to the new realities of the marketplace, which are both scale and reimbursement related. And we've got some of our best people in the U.S. Our president of the Drug Company, David Neu has got some of his key people looking at what we can do there in terms of automation, et cetera. So I think it's something that has been a surprise to us on the negative side, but we're working through it appropriately. And as I pointed to in our remarks, a very strong performance in our Specialty business. We bought 2 really small businesses there and we're really thrilled that, not only collaboration with the U.S., but the position on some stand-alone programs in Canada, particularly opportunities in the managed care area, et cetera. So we are really pleased about our progress in Specialty there, and that really proves that our international thesis that we can really be a leader in Specialty is very valid. So anything to add, Tim?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I would just say, I mean, we've made progress already this quarter compared to last year, so we're working hard to take cost out and look at other ways to automate. And again, a lot of it is labor cost that we have to focus on. And there was probably a couple of pennies of headwind, but we think we'll make progress in the second half of the year.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And Tim, if I could just follow up. I have a follow-up question to you on capital deployment. I know it looks like you guys bought back about $284 million worth of stock this quarter, understanding it's a seasonably challenging quarter from a cash perspective, cash generation perspective. You ended the quarter with $400 million on the balance sheet. I'm just curious how aggressive you feel you can be, near term, on share repos and is there a minimal cash balance that you target maintaining?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. We always like to be around $500 million, so we dipped a little bit under that, Bob. But I think, we'll -- again, we have to cycle through -- we have a high inventory balance. We cycle through that in the March quarter. Between March and June, that comes down. So we'll just evaluate our cash as we go and also kind of how that looks and how the market and our share price looks before we decide to deploy for any more share repurchases.","Operator","And next, from the line of Steve Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question on D&A. That was up over 30% year-over-year and presumably, a lot of that is intangible asset amortization tied to recent acquisitions. So I guess I'm curious, have you guys given any further thought to maybe switching to reporting cash EPS as pretty much all your peers are doing now?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Steve, I'll address that. I mean, we -- today, we talked about the impact on intangibles, World Courier and TheraCom, and I highlighted the number, it was $4 million. It's -- we also have depreciation from the World Courier acquisition coming in this year. We talk about, we consider it, but at this point, we feel like if we disclose and give enough information, that it's not necessary yet to switch over.","Operator","And we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, when you talked about the oncology market, you talked about the evolution, changing needs of the physician, changing needs around reimbursement. Can you maybe just give us some thoughts as you think about the future of the oncology market and what that has the potential to do to your margin structure? Do you think that there's opportunities for margins to be better? Or do you think that this is going to be something that will put pressure on your margins as we see this evolution in the oncology market?","Steven H. Collis","Well, clearly, our margins are better in the Specialty business. I mean, that is a fact. But I think we've got some unique opportunities here. And what led to this project is we're looking at our strength in our health system or hospital business and we were just looking at how much oncology are we doing in the hospital business, and it was really very significant. And then we look at the growth of some of these direct programs we're doing in our ASD and ICS business and some of the strength we have in our oral oncology programs, both in Specialty as well as in our Consulting Services business, where we do a lot of reimbursement support, adherence programs, clinical programs and even helping with pricing as we look issues like comparative effectiveness. Oncology really drives all of ABC's portfolio. I think, when I took over as COO, that's one of the key themes that we've been looking at is irrespective of site of care, using all of the scale and breadth and expertise of AmerisourceBergen. So I think this is very consistent with that theme. What we've here most recently done is made it easier for community practices that are transitioning to a hospital setting or into a larger network, to be able to access best-in-class pricing, being compliant with all the manufacturer pricing policies, the class of trade issues that might arise, but also giving the manufacturers some of those data elements that they want. And even, we've had a lot of hospital group purchasing organizations say, \"We want some sort of an affiliation with your ION business, where we can offer a lot of those key service items that our physicians, oncologists are used to from organizations like ION.\" So all these things are coming together, and it's a terrific opportunity for us to display some of the unique capabilities we have and create differentiation and value add for our customers, both on the manufacturer and provider side.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But from a financial perspective, do you think that, that will enhance your margins? Will they pay for data? Will they pay for these other services over time and therefore -- clearly, we know Specialty is already better than drug distribution, but can you see an increase in opportunity? Or do you think that it's going to be a market share gain, where you need to gain market share because there is pressure on overall margins on the oncology business. How should we think about that going forward?","Steven H. Collis","Just a quick response to that. I tell you, if we don't keep oncology being special and cancer treatment being special, then we won't have a chance to create that differentiated margin, so really important for us to do that. It's also important for us to create that stickiness with the customers. So I think we've got an opportunity to enhance our margins by some of these, in the hospital business, by some of these value-added services. And again, I think in my comments I made, I talked about, we really think a lot about the value add and getting paid for that, and nothing could be truer than extending a lot of these really high-value services to the hospital system and including getting some additional fees from manufacturers. So we think there's a chance to improve the margins in the hospital system, particularly as oncology becomes a broader part of that. And let's try and keep oncology a specialty practice.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up to Tim. We talked about guidance. I just want 2 clarifications, if you could help us. The first would be around the litigation settlements. Were those contemplated when you gave us the original guidance and will we see any additional litigation settlements this year? And then secondly, around the share repurchase and the increase in share repurchase, should we think of that also being incorporated in the guidance and should we be thinking that you'll be buying back shares with free cash flow equally throughout the rest of the year? How should we think about those 2 things in the guidance number?","Tim G. Guttman","Sure, Lisa. The litigation, I mean, that's an area that some of those take several years to play out and get the cash. We just happened to get 3 in the door, a couple came in right near the end of the year, so they're really not contemplated in the guidance when they -- and were a cash basis. So when they arrive, we recognize them. There is another one that may come at the end of the year. There's some discussion about another one that could be a little bit larger, maybe September, October time period. But again, until you get -- until they arrive, you just never know. The other question was just about share repurchases. I mean, really, it's hard to say. We gave our guidance for $400 million for the year. A lot of it just depends on timing, market conditions, when those will come during the year. We'll evaluate as we go. And really, no commitments whether it's quarters 2, 3 or 4. It's just, we tend to be opportunistic.","Operator","And we'll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If you can just help us a little a bit with how we think about the progression of the model. So when we think about distribution margins, obviously, there are 2 keys factors this year that are pressuring margin, the addition of the Express business and then the generic comps. So when I think about the year-over-year change in distribution margin in this quarter, can you quantify for us what percent is from Express versus from the generic comps?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Ricky, we're not that specific in terms of the change in the margin. I mean, we are pretty pleased with the margin this quarter. That margin compression, we'll see a little bit more. Q2 is a tough quarter with the generic comps. Last year was a pretty good quarter when you had Lipitor and Zyprexa the full quarter. And I'll just say that in terms of margin, it gets a little bit better when we're into 3 and 4.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But sequentially, there shouldn't be really any change in the impact that Express will have on your business. Is that a fair statement?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I think that's a fair statement.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the operating expense line, I think you mentioned same-store was up 6% due to the higher cost structure in Canada. What should it be on a normalized basis? And when we think about the model, when do you expect to return to those normalized levels?","Tim G. Guttman","We -- as you know, Ricky, we really pride ourselves on managing expenses. So I mean, a normalized model, if we're up 2%, 2.5%, that's kind of what we hold ourselves to in terms of a standard. So I think it's going to take a little bit of time that we talked about of cycling through some of the initiatives we have with Canada here. So it's going to be a little bit higher this year. But hopefully, that will be, as we get -- as we pass this year and get into '14, we'll see some more expense benefit.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Ricky. Next question, please?","Operator","And that's from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you tell us in general terms what percent of your book has been reworked over the last 12 months and is that a higher rate than normal? And is that contributing at all to some of the margin comps, in addition to some of the other stuff that we talked about?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I mean, we've got the big one with our large PBM customer that we sized. We don't have a lot of contract renewal coming up this year, as you know. As I said, I think, to one of the earlier questions, John, we are busy -- we obviously always try and renew customers early where we think it makes sense. But the one thing I would point to is we had a good contract with a large food and drug chain account that we've lost. That has somewhat affected our margins. So Tim, anything else you'd point to?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I guess I'd point out that, again, we've always talked recently in the last few months just about generic launches. I mean, 2013, I think, is one of the lowest years over a 10- or 11-year period. So between the Express Scripts new contract and the loss of the other customer Steve mentioned and just slow generic launches, that's really -- that puts a lot of pressure on our margin. But again, as we said at Investor Day, as we cycle through '13, we're pretty bullish on increasing that margin and growing it in '14 and beyond.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just to kind of push a little bit further into this Express Scripts contract. Years 2 and 3, in a large contract like that, that's all branded and kind of a low service level. How does the margin compare in 2 and 3? I know it gets a lot better on a contract where you're doing generics, but on a pure branded contract like this, is there a material difference in margin as you go through it? Or is this kind of where it will be?","Steven H. Collis","It would largely depend on the buy side. I mean, it'd depend on the price increase environment. There might be some modest upside, couple of basis points at best, I mean. It's a very big contract. And obviously, as you'd expect, the large customer, John, as you know very well, get the best margin. But we do hope to do more strategic initiatives with our largest customers.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, it's just -- it looks, I mean, to me like the margin on that contract and then the VA contract at McKesson, the margins are just so skinny, Year 1, you just wonder there has to be some other reasons why some of these contracts are being priced where they are, because they just look like they're very marginally profitable. So there must be some benefits in purchasing scale or other things that you can't see, just looking at the contract in isolation.","Steven H. Collis","I don't know if that's a question or conclusion.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean, you're making -- I mean, you're clearly making less money on the combo contract than you're making on stand-alone with the SRX. So that implies the margin went down by more than half, and so that's complicating things somewhat. I know it's in your guidance and you're growing, but...","Steven H. Collis","It's a larger contract. I think we were uniquely positioned to serve it, and it's probably operationally easier than a lot of other large contracts. So you may think of that. And it drives a lot of efficiency. And Tim talked about Sacramento, for example, and the strategic -- we regard our greenfield as strategic assets. And honestly, a lot them are really set up around key mail order sites for their customers. So a lot of reasons we strategically wanted to keep the account. But I think we've talked enough about that particular contract, so I appreciate it, John.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","And that's from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about the SAP implementation progress? I mean, one of your large competitors was going through a similar type of thing, and they mentioned there were a couple of delays in their situation. It sounds like things are going pretty smoothly for you. And then also with the Express Medco contract, did that all come on at the beginning of the quarter, like right at the start? Or was it sort of phased in throughout the quarter? And are they using -- or are they on the SAP platform or is there more migrations to occur there?","Steven H. Collis","Yes, the Express contract definitely started October 1, and we hit the ground running. We took it almost in whole, and we had a lot of their business already. We had a lot because of the former Medco's mail order business. So we increased the contract by, I think, 30% to 35%. That's a fair comment, right, Tim?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes.","Steven H. Collis","So we did use -- the way we process orders internally, shouldn't be always confused with external, the way that customers order from us, which is through many different mechanisms, often their own ERP systems and their own EDI systems. So I think the majority, of course, of the PBM business is now being serviced by distribution centers that are on the SAP platform. And then just remind me about your other question?","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So from the technology perspective, if the Express Medco contract is sort of fully integrated, SAP is running smoothly -- And then, just one other piece. Did I hear that you said the Specialty operating income, did that -- did you mention that, that declined on a year-over-year basis or not?","Tim G. Guttman","David, it's Tim. I mentioned that it declined slightly. And again, I pointed to oncology generic drugs being down slightly this year versus last year. Even though we had Oxy come back, it didn't offset the other 2, Gemcitabine and Docetaxel.","Barbara A. Brungess","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","And that's from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. Just maybe going back then, Tim, to the guidance on free cash flow guidance here. Obviously, your peer that -- the peer that lost the Express portion of the contract, and I noted that there's a cash flow impact to their balance sheet, does that -- should we think that there should be a benefit to your cash flow, maybe not this year, but as we think about next year when this contract's ramped up? Given that it's a more simple contract, does it benefit working capital for you?","Tim G. Guttman","No, it doesn't. Actually -- and again, that's part of the reason why our free cash flow is down a little bit in this quarter. It's just ramping up. Like Steve mentioned, they came on strong in Q1, ramped up to a pretty high level right away. And of course, with the terms, they -- we had to establish their AR balance. So again, that shouldn't -- the good news is that shouldn't be a big factor going forward. It's kind a onetime impact, and now it just changes based on growth. But again, that's behind us, so we have to cycle through that. But I think, hopefully, that answers your questions.","Operator","And we'll go to George Hill with Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Tim, just kind of one more follow-up on the gross margin contribution, where you had said that in the Specialty segment, gross profit contribution declined, we'll call it, a smidgen in the quarter. That means that, I guess, the gross profit contribution from the regular Drug Company was up, just with gross margins off, let's call it, 30 bps or so. Am I thinking about that conceptually right?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, for the segment, George, for Pharmaceutical Distribution, we're pretty much flat with Drug Company U.S. And again, we're really pleased with that, right, because we had 3 headwinds we called out. So for them to be flat with the -- with Express, generic launches, the loss of Topco, we're really pleased with that performance. Canada impacted us slightly from a GP standpoint, but mostly expense. And then finally, yes, Specialty was down a bit, again, because of the oncology generics.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then maybe just one more quick follow-up housekeeping question. On the Other segment, gross margins have kind of continued to rise if you look back at it over the last 5 quarters. Should we expect to see any seasonality to the Other segment? Or should we think of this gross profit contribution rate from the Other segment as kind of a run rate going forward, maybe even with the opportunity for some improvement?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I would hope that you would see some improvement, right? Again, you're talking about the Other segment. I think there's some opportunity there as we expand business. And clearly, in that Other segment, you have -- it's a people business. So as you can leverage that infrastructure, you should be able to drop more through to the bottom line. So I would think, I would like to see both GP and operating income margins expand.","Barbara A. Brungess","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I want to pick up where a few folks were talking about and something you mentioned, Steve, in the script. We've been hearing a lot more back and forth between Teva and Amgen on sort of Neupogen and Neulasta. How do you think about that as sort of an opportunity with a November launch? Obviously, it's a bit different sort of than a traditional biosimilar. Is that something you guys see as something that could theoretically be a benefit to the business? How are you sort of looking at that opportunity?","Steven H. Collis","I think AmerisourceBergen will be very strong on any physician-administered product, I mean, whether it's oncology, ophthalmology and urology. I mean, any physician-administered product will be very strong. We don't comment specifically on individual products. Obviously, you're talking about oncology products. I think you know our strength there. I think we've -- we think that we've done very well obviously with the multi-source generics, especially in the 6-month exclusivity. So I think wherever the market takes us, we'll be a strong beneficiary and a strong participant.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess the question is maybe -- and again, less specific to maybe how it impacts your business. But how do you think about -- and this is sort of a very different launch, right? And do you think this will tell somewhat of how people will think about the biosimilar opportunity for the business or as cases like this where it's another brand coming to market that will be potentially substitutable, is that a bit more tricky to sort of gauge? I mean, I guess the sense is, do you feel like this will give any confidence to sort of the future opportunity in biosimilars? Or is this sort of a different event?","Steven H. Collis","I think what we're learning about biosimilars is that it's definitely more expensive to bring to market, much more complicated clinical pathway. It's definitely very different than an oral solid because they are biotech products. And we think that when as products get closer to being launched, we'll have a great opportunity to talk to manufacturers. We think the pricing should stay up fairly close to the brand, that the biosimilar will be as similar. There will be some clinical differences between the respective products, the incumbent brand and the new entrant. And I think that they're going to need our full portfolio services to help commercialize the products. So we see it as, frankly, so much more upside than any concern. So we're very bullish, and we look forward to clear regulatory pathway for these products to be launched. We think it will be a big upside for us and for our customers, frankly.","Barbara A. Brungess","And now Steve would like to make some final comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you very much, everyone. I appreciate your attention. I know it's a busy day for you. Just to reiterate, a key reason that I have confidence in our future is because our belief that the AmerisourceBergen associates really set us apart. Whatever the challenge is, whether it's a national natural disaster, implementing a new multibillion dollar account, the new SAP system, which we've been so successful with, developing the new oncology service line, our associates really work collaboratively across the whole organization to creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They share mine and my lead team's commitment to meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work beside them.","Thank you very much for your time today.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. And before we go, I'd like to highlight our next 2 upcoming events. We'll be attending the Citibank Health Care Conference in New York on February 25 and the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 5. That concludes our call for today. And now I will turn it back to the operator. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation.

Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Tim Guttman. Please go ahead.","Barbara Brungess","Hello. Actually this is Barbara Brungess and good morning everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's conference call covering our first quarter of fiscal 2015. I am the Vice President of Corporate Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2014 and other filings. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the Company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steve Collis","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. As we reported this morning in our press release, AmerisourceBergen associates delivered excellent financial results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased 15% to $33.6 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were up over 42% to $1.14, while we generated a very strong $900 million in operating cash flow.","One of the most gratifying aspects of this quarter\u2019s results is that it was driven by strong performance from virtually every one of our businesses. The strength of these core business positions and offerings combined with our disciplined capital management gives us the flexibility to continue to expand on knowledge, reach and partnership, as we make plans to broaden our provider and manufacture service offerings to new market segments.","Earlier in January, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire MWI Veterinary Supply, a premier animal health distributor with $2.5 billion in cash. We commenced this tender offer for all outstanding shares of MWI on January 26, and we expect to close the transaction during the March quarter. ","As I said when we first announced the deal, ABC has delivered significant growth and shareholder value by staying focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain where we have developed unparallel knowledge and expertise and by bring a collaborative philosophy to all of our relationships. Jim Cleary and his team at MWI will be our deal partners with whom to bold on that foundation and they stand our reach into the growing global animal health sector.","MWI is already well respected for their great success since the company was founded in 1976 and went public in 2005. But we believe that by combining MWI\u2019s legacy of success and innovation with ABC\u2019s relevant experience in manufacturing and provider services and our global reach, we will create a compelling opportunity to launch the next generation of superior animal health products and services. I am very excited about the future contributions that Jim and his team will make to AmerisourceBergen and about the potential for growth that we see ahead.","Let\u2019s turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the December quarter. Overall we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2015 and we see ourselves up well to meet our strategic and updated financial objectives for the full year. ","Finally on the momentum as we had, as we exited fiscal 2014, our performance in the first quarter was very robust. Strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove exceptional adjusted earnings per share growth and a significant improvement in working capital led to stellar cash flow especially for the December quarter.","Tim will provide further details. But I want to call out some highlights from our business units. Last quarter I noted that our individual business units continuously became less distinct from one and other by focusing the efforts on collaboratively meeting the need of suppliers and customers. Our ability to achieve comprehensive enterprise wide solutions is particularly valuable in a fast changing market and is a key driver of our results. Many of these solutions are of course in the specialty area with the unique combination of services and expertise we offer helps manufacturers and customers manage the challenges of the fast growing area of the market.","Just the specialty products now permeate nearly every segment of our business discussions about opportunities within the specialty realm are top of mind for virtually all of our customer. We believe we are the best positioned to maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products of advanced specialty products for manufacturers, healthcare providers and the patients they serve.","AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a strong quarter with revenues up 15% even as we anniversary the first full quarter of the Walgreens brand business. Overall market growth trends remain quite good and a strong flu season was very helpful to our overall retail and vaccine sales on this. The December quarter was the first full quarter where we had all of the brand and generic business from Walgreens and we are very pleased to have the distribution contract fully implemented.","Good organic growth overcame the rollover some old business and sales of the new hepatitis C drug has also contributed to ABDC\u2019s revenue growth. Overall drug pricing trends remain quite favorable and generic sales are strong across all of ABDC\u2019s customer segments. We are very pleased that our independent pharmacy chains, health systems and ultimate side customers, all performed well in the quarter.","Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers are benefiting from favorable market conditions as well as some ABC specific programs including those that improve independent retail pharmacy\u2019s access to specialty products such as the new hepatitis C drugs and other therapies. Our diverse customer base helps us ensure the widest patient access possible to both sophisticated new therapies as well as long established products. And our extensive manufacturer relationships ensures our customers participate in the provision of the full spectrum of pharmaceutical care.","During the quarter we continued to reap the benefits of our long term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance in both the distribution to Walgreens stores and the contribution from the sourcing joint venture. We are very pleased with the progress that JV has made to-date and going forward we will work collaboratively to ensure the value we bring to manufacturers and the programs and services we bring to our customers.","In addition we have made significant progress in our BluePoint private label program and ramping up the activities in ABC Switzerland. All of these activities are demonstrative of the value that wholesale has bring to the supply chain and of the specific innovations AmerisourceBergen brings to the table.","During the quarter we officially opened our national distribution center in Columbus. The state of the art facility helps for our logistics and inventory management efficiency for both ABC and our manufacturer partners. This and other investments we have made and continue to make in our infrastructure enable us to meaningfully enhance our services and strengthen our ability to grow our business over the long-term. ","ABSG also had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impacts of some manufacturing posed changes on certain oncology products, which moves some revenues from drug company to specialty. ABSG\u2019s revenues were up 17%. Our physician distribution business performed very well, and ASD was particularly strong in the December quarter. Given my long history with our community oncology business and our confidence in offerings in this area is especially gratifying to report that our community oncology business grew ahead of expectations into December quarter. This was due to a mix of new business, some earlier than expected product increases and an overall increase in volume. While reimbursement issues persists and sales of practices to help systems continued without a slower rate we are hopefully seeing stabilization on the community oncology market which is a great benefit for overall cancer care. ","Oncology treatments will continue to be provided across various healthcare venues and we are very well positioned to ensure that our customers remain in the forefront of the evolution of cancer care. ","Our manufacture services businesses also had a strong quarter with both consulting services and World Courier performing very well. The unrivaled service offerings in this area are of keen interest to both our manufacturer provider customers and a key driver of value as a cost and complexity of medication therapies increase. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy area, along with our experience in developing patient adherence programs is a clear differentiator today and an opportunity for growth in the future particularly as buyers some of those begin to come to market. ","Our knowledge base, combined with the immense scale of our distribution businesses and our increasingly global reach, make us the ideal partner for those who want to lead the next evolutionary change in healthcare. ","As I have said many times it is an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic condition, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics. The R&D pipeline is full of innovative products that hold a potential to make great strides across many disease states. The combination of an advanced therapeutic medicine and expanding access to health care drives growth opportunities and more importantly, meaningfully improves patient lives. ","Many of the same growth rates hold true for the animal health market as well. As American age pet ownership is increasing and pets themselves are living longer. Advantage in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of loss of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining pet health. In addition the increasingly global demand for protein drives demands on a production side of the market. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the transaction and we firmly believe that MWI is a premier distributor in these two areas of business focus and we are very excited to add animal health to our portfolio of services.","Looking ahead to reminder fiscal 2015, we expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Generic inflation was strong in the December quarter but has been modest so far in January. ","We also had some brand price increases in December that we had been expecting to see in January particularly in specialty. As a result we expected that the contribution from generic inflation will be flat in the remaining quarters versus last year, and that brand inflation will remain strong. While we were pleased to see the first version of generic Nexium approved by the FDA there remains a lack of clarity regarding the timing of the launch of the product into the marketplace and they extend to which there will be competition of manufacturers of the generic. ","Given these trends in our performance in the December quarter we have raised our guidance for the reminder of the year in a few key areas. Tim will provide greater detail and in summary on consolidated basis we now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 11%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the range of 12% to 15%. Free cash flow generation in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As a result of cash being used in product to fund MWI transaction we have reduced the amount of share repurchases we expect to complete in fiscal 2015 and our regular share repurchase program to $200 million but we will complete $400 million of repurchase under the special program as we have previously discussed. ","Another noteworthy event for AmerisourceBergen was the January 16 announcement that Ornella Barra has joined our Board.

I am very pleased with our outstanding financial and operation performance we achieved across our entire business. There are many moving parts in the remainder of fiscal 2015 but I am confident that we will meet our objectives for the year. Meeting our financial and operational goals is only one dimension of success however. It is a combination of unmatched execution and bold innovative thinking that really drives long term value. So I constantly challenge our associates to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations while creatively looking forward to the future. The strength of our coal business gives us a powerful platform upon which to build and that gives me great confidence that we will continue to make new and watchable contributions to the market face and thereby continue to provide excellent returns to our shareholders. ","Now here is Tim.","Tim Guttman ","Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned we\u2019re off to an excellent start for fiscal \u201915. Consistent with past quarter my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons of the first quarter ended December 2014 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have two main topics to cover this morning, first I will recap first quarter consolidated and segment performance and second I will cover our revised fiscal \u201915 expectations.","With that we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 15%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continues to drive our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and positive trends in the industry. As a reminder this marks the first quarter that we had the Walgreens generic volume for all stores for the entire quarter. ","On an overall basis Walgreens accounted for slightly over half of our 15% revenue growth. The quarter\u2019s adjusted gross profit increased 24% to $896 million. The growth was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment driven primarily by better than expected revenue on both brand and generics. Also we continue to benefit from a strong manufacturer pricing environment.","Operating expenses. Our total adjusted operating expenses increased 15% to $461 million, the expense increase co-related with the large revenue increase in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Consistent with past quarters the increase in expenses were primarily related to distribution under labor expense, delivery cost and depreciation of capital assets to support the business ramp. ","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $436 million up about $113 million with a very strong 35% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.30% up 19 basis points. Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $15 million down about 19% due primarily to the refinancing of debt which we completed last year. ","Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 37.9% for the current quarter down some from the prior year. Looking out for the full year we still expect our tax rate to be about 37% driven by growth in our international businesses. And for the quarter our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 43% to $1.14 driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth.","Our adjusted diluted share count was 229 million shares down roughly 3%. This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results and let\u2019s move forward and discuss our segment results starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. ","Total segment revenues were about $33 billion up 15%, as mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company led the way with a 15% revenue increase. Our revenue growth and our core drug business was driven by four items. One, as I mentioned earlier we reached full delivery of all generic drugs to all Walgreens locations for the full quarter. Two, our sales to Walgreens exceeded our expectations especially generics and three, we continue to see the revenue benefit from the uptake in hepatitis C drugs. These drugs accounted for roughly one third of the drug company's total revenue growth and then finally four, overall market growths driven by volume and strong pricing. ","Our specialty business group and overall revenue increased of about 26%. As widely reported two manufacturers shifted certain fuse oncology drugs from full line distribution to specialty distribution. Excluding this shift our specialty business still grew an impressive 17% with growth coming from oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. We also had very good growth in our community oncology business driven by positive pricing trends and some new business. ","Finally our ICS third-party logistics business also had very good revenue growth due to new business wins and volume growth with existing manufacturer customers. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty that I just provided are before interest segment eliminations consistent with how we have reported this growth rate in past growth.","Moving to gross profit. The segment\u2019s gross profit was $752 million, up $158 million or about 27%. Drug Company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth. And in both drug and specialty, we experienced better than expected brand and generic price appreciation. The segment did see better than expected gross profit from the late flu season and also the continued growth of our private label program BluePoint.","Operating expenses were $362 million and were up about 18%. As I mentioned previously, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting the segment\u2019s significant volume growth. As an example, our Drug Company shift roughly two times the number of units this quarter compared to last year as a result of being fully ramped now with Walgreens generic volume, growth in the Walgreens business and growth from our other customer accounts.","Segment operating income was $390 million and up about 36% driven by the outstanding performance of the Drug Company. As Steve highlighted, we\u2019re also extremely pleased with our specialty business and the fast start they had with an operating income growth rate in the mid-teens, driven by several positive trends in our business portfolio.","We can now move to our other segment, which includes Consulting Services and World Courier. In the quarter, segment revenues increased $92 million or about 50% to $696 million, roughly 60% of the segment\u2019s revenue dollar growth came from TheraCom our distribution business within Consulting. We did experience a very good growth rate in our core Consulting business in the teens due to the start of several new manufacturer programs and organic growth in existing programs.","World Courier also had solid revenue growth, however the revenue growth was somewhat dampened by foreign currency exchange rates. From an operating income standpoint this segment had operating income of $45 million reflecting growth of 26%. Consulting and World Courier each contributed about equally to the income growth. Consulting contributed primarily to top line growth. World Courier contributed through a combination of top line growth and expense management.","This completes our segment review. Let me switch and quickly cover our two large GAAP items; warrants and LIFO. Warrants, the fair value of the warrants increased about $600 million to approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31st correlated to the increase in the ABC share price for the same period. This resulted in a total expense of $371 million for the quarter. About 80% of this expense is the retroactive adjustment needed to properly report expense through the eight quarters we\u2019ve had the warrants outstanding.","LIFO, this quarter we report an expense of $144 million which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year LIFO expense was estimated suing two key assumptions. One, price inflation remains at the same levels for both brand and generics as what we experienced last year. And two, we are forecasting a higher inventory balance at yearend due to overall business growth versus our previous year end. These assumptions are driving the large expected full year LIFO expense. And we will of course update our assumptions moving forward each quarter.","This wraps up our P&L review. I\u2019d like to now cover working capital and cash flow items. This quarter we had terrific free cash flow, $840 million. We are clearly benefiting from the growth in our generic drug volumes, which have much better payable terms. Specifically our DPO or days payable to suppliers improved nearly six days from last year. Again, this reflects a larger mix of our business being generics. Our free cash flow also benefited from a one-time reduction in the inventory of about $150 million from the closing of our old Florida distribution center.","The next area I\u2019d like to cover is share buybacks. During the quarter our regular share buybacks were $132 million. We ended the quarter with $443 million available on our regular share repurchase authorization. We also purchased the same dollar amount under our special share repurchase program. And as reminder, these shares are specifically designated to offset expected dilutions from the warrants and are not included in our adjusted share count. We ended the quarter with $266 million available on our special share authorization.","During the quarter we also took steps to improve our warrant hedging position. We partnered with a bank to increase the ceilings specifically on our 2016 cap calls given the increase in our share price. As a result we incurred a liability of about $78 million through December 31st. we finished the program in the January at a total cost of $100 million. And as a reminder there is no P&L impact in connection with our hedging program.","Now let\u2019s turn to our revised fiscal \u201915 expectations. My initial guidance comments that I will cover this morning exclude the impact from the MWI transaction so you have a better comparable to the guidance we provided back in late October.","At the very end, I will make a few comments about the impact to guidance with MWI included. Revenues based on positive trends in our business and the industry, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 10% to 11% range. ","Gross profit, let me comment on two specific items within gross profit. The first will be generic price appreciation. As I mentioned earlier, generic price inflation was better than expected in our first quarter. While the trend in the past several quarters is for manufacturers to raise prices in the first month of the quarter, so far in January we haven\u2019t seen much activity in this area. Therefore, in nearly four months into our fiscal year we are not changing our full year assumption. We are confident that our annual expectation will be met which is flat dollars compared to last year.","The second item is generic drug launches. There has been recent news about generic Nexium entering the market. At this point, there are still many open questions about the launch including when product will be available, how quickly the FDA will approve other manufactures who have filed ANDAs, the timing of those launches, the ability of manufacturers to produce enough product to cover the large market and the impact of potential court actions. At this point we do not expect the launch of generic Nexium to be as beneficial as we originally expected. Therefore, we have lowered our assumption for the gross profit contribution from this item especially in the second half of the year.","Operating income, for fiscal \u201915 we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be 9% to 11% driven by our first quarter performance and higher interest paid four year revenue growth. However, the change in our generic Nexium contribution assumption that I just called out is a partial offset to income growth. Operating margin, we now expect our operating margin to be relative flat in fiscal \u201915. This is due primarily to higher brand drug revenues including the continued growth in hepatitis C drugs.","Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal \u201915 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55 which reflects growth of 12% to 15% from last year\u2019s adjusted EPS. Importantly, as you think about our EPS quarterly progression, we now expect that our combined adjusted EPS in the first half of the fiscal year will be slightly greater and the combined adjusted EPS in our second half. Share repurchase, our revised guidance of regular share repurchases is $200 million for the full year, down from previous guidance due to cash that will be used in conjunction with the MWI closing. We remain committed to $400 million in special share repurchases for the full year.","Switching to our free cash flow guidance. With better growth in generic revenues and generics having significantly better working capital metrics, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As I highlighted assuming that we successfully closed the MWI transaction in the March quarter, we will provide more detailed guidance on our April earnings call. For today\u2019s call, we will reiterate that MWI will add an incremental $0.08 to our adjusted EPS spread evenly between our June and September quarters. This means that our guidance range including the contribution from MWI will be $4.53 to $4.63.","So in summary, one quarter doesn\u2019t make a year we have a long way to go but we are off to a great start. Our commitment is that we will continue to work hard servicing our customers. We will deploy capital properly and we will make the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC.","Now here is Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up so we can accommodate as many callers as possible during the time available. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll go to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric Coldwell","Just a quick one, very strong quarter, congrats on the performance. I am interested in particular in the comments on the two manufacturers shifting the specialty oncology drugs from broad drug distribution into the specialty segment. One, what was the driver of that? Two, did you get any incremental opportunity as that shift in distribution practice moved to your specialty group? And three, what was the impact if any on economics? Thanks very much.","Steve Collis","I\u2019ll start out and let Tim follow up. This was not driven by ABC. It was driven by a manufacturer quality change and of course oncology products have got all high value economic value but also of course value to the patients and many manufacturers I think mark a single distribution point because it gives them very clear insight into inventory levels et cetera, inventory turns, patient access issues. So there are various benefits. Essentially the manufactures that we are talking about are working with many participants in the supply channel and we land up with our very big share of the health systems market which is certainly around the mid-30s. We land up servicing many our own customer internally, and as far as the economics guide up I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll like to comment on economics for individual contracts but Tim I'll let you also respond to Eric\u2019s question. ","Tim Guttman","Yes I would say that we are notified by two manufactures, they want to better control the product and the supply chain and again this product was going to health systems, continues to primarily go to health systems and really no change in the economics.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ricky Goldwasser ","Can you help us understand the dynamics in the hep C a little bit better? I know you talked about the fact that there was a sequential improvement in the volume contribution that you saw. Maybe if you can give us some color on what percent of topline growth in the quarter is coming from hep C; and then how do you think about the contribution from hep C for the remainder of the year? Are you agnostic between the two manufacturers, Gilead and AbbVie? And just how do you think about the market, given that obviously the last 12 months have been very strong for you on that front? ","Tim Guttman","Hep C definitely contributed to our topline, I think I called out in our segment for drug company, drug grew by 15%, hep C was about 5%. I would say that we also saw growth sequentially between last quarter and this quarter. And the other comment I would make is remember that really last year and fiscal year we really saw hep C come out the second half of our year. So we still have this quarter and the next quarter will get a bigger benefit compared to last year for that hep C impact and then we\u2019ll start to anniversary.","Steve Collis","We\u2019ve had a number of questions based on this, just the way that manufacturers contract with PBM and payers doesn\u2019t really reflect our economics at all, it doesn\u2019t go through the charge backed system, it\u2019s really have quarterly rebate mechanism. So obviously we provide datas to different parties that might measure who's to spend in what but we are not really effected by the economics. The economics on the bar side between the various manufactures are pretty similar probably within few basis points of each. So really we are agonistic, but it\u2019s -- again, it\u2019s just a great boon to our customers in a strong participation by community pharmacy, ABC is very strong in the ultimate care segment where a lot of these products are being dispensed and patients are accessing the medication. So it\u2019s been a great trend for our whole industry and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of our role in helping eliminate what is serious health care issue. It\u2019s been a great product for everybody. Great set of products I should say.","Ricky Goldwasser","Then just one follow-up. Obviously, you've reported very strong gross margin year-over-year trends and also on the operating margin. So can you just comment? Are you starting to see a benefit from joint-venture economics spilling to the rest of your core book? ","Steve Collis","Well I think we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s almost again this quarter in March it will be two years since we made our announcement. And we do think it\u2019s been quite a historic announcement specifically for ABC, but indeed for our whole industry. And it\u2019s really enabled us to collaborate and frankly just having Walgreens as a customer and having that anchor tenant has been just a good benefit to ABC that improves our scale and what we've tried to do and we are very, very serious about this is we really want the relationship to benefit all of our customers and I think we\u2019ve seen that that all of our customers would have just more inventory available, our transportation allowance for example have greatly improved because we\u2019re getting out more orders, so that benefits all of our customers. And we certainly have the system scale and the operational scale to manage this contract and take excellent care of all of our customers. So it\u2019s been a great benefit and on the manufacture side I think obviously they\u2019ve been a lot of changes in the industry. But overall I think everyone is doing very well and some of the goals that we identified which is about having longer term strategic relationships with the group in burn on the WBAD side have done a fantastic job. And we\u2019re doing very well as is the whole industry doing well. ","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby","Hey, Steve. One of your customers has hinted at its ability to manage the oncology cost trend. How does this affect you? Are you a partner in this effort, or indifferent to the effort, or are you monitoring the effort?","Steve Collis","We are very involved with their physician administration of oncology drugs that we still have strong market share there. It\u2019s a business that I noted how particularly personally proud I was to see the growth in this quarter and we hope it will continue. It did surprise us. It was a bit stronger than we expected as both Tim and I pointed out. ","So what we do in community oncology is try help our customers really have the data tools and have the contracting tools so that they can have really good relationships with payers and other interested parties like PBMs.","So everyone really understands how the treatment is being conducted, that it's being conducted at the highest of standards. And I\u2019ve don\u2019t think that anything that our customers are doing or the way we're contracting with manufacturers is adversarial to their physician. I think it\u2019s really all about excellent customer and patient care and we are riding the forefront of that with on an oncology supply business.","Robert Willoughby","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to try to put this quarter a little bit more in context relative to the rest of the year, both on the revenue and on the EBIT outlook side. It does look like, obviously, we're calling for a deceleration in topline growth; and if I look at EBIT growth, it looks like you guys grew about 35% in the quarter. I know you raised the growth for the year to 9% to 11%, but still obviously implying a fairly big deceleration. Could you maybe just, in big buckets, help us understand how you see the year playing out? What are the specific areas that we should anticipate to slow down, both on the topline and then also within the EBIT contribution? ","Tim Guttman","I would say -- again I would say that we raised our midpoint of our guidance about $0.07 so we\u2019re feeling good about the year. There is still some moving parts and some complexity. Clearly a big swing factor is generic inflation. We have to determine some of it seems to be pulled forward into Q1 so we need a little bit more time to assess that for the balance of the year. And I would say the other big swing factor for us too is just generic Nexium. And we were pretty encouraged that that was going to be a really big positive side, such a big brand drug that we thought it\u2019s going to be a big positive in the second half.","We do slow down a bit, we start to anniversary more of that Walgreens business revenue the second half of the year and also the WBAD contribution we start to anniversary that the second half of the year. That\u2019s why I think a little bit of my discussion of guidance we think will be a little bit heavier weighted to the first half than the second half.","Steve Collis","We also implement the new DoD contract, so the full change in the pricing there. And we had a very strong Q3 and Q4 of our fiscal year \u201914 with generic price increases. So the comps are a lot harder because we were again we never quite sure what quarters is going to come in. But we\u2019re confident in our full year outlook.","Tim Guttman","Steve that\u2019s a great point, the last two years to remind everybody we\u2019ve been heavily we were backend loaded on generic price appreciation in the June-September quarters. Again, got off to a good start in December, still leaving more time to assess how that\u2019s going to play out for the balance of the year. And at what quarters we get the benefit.","Robert Jones","Make sense, thanks so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian","First is on community oncology. This business seems to be making a key shift. So first, to better frame the significance, how big is this within overall oncology, which I thought was about one-third of Specialty? Then second part of that question is you mentioned new business and uptick in volumes. Can you just elaborate on both? Where is this new business coming from? And is this uptick in volume perhaps due to buying ahead of a price increase? Or is this going to be more sustainable we can expect for the rest of the year? ","Steve Collis","Again, it was slightly stronger than we expected. We don\u2019t think it was really driven much by price increases or anything at that time, we did see volumes. Clearly, I think a lot of the practices that are going to still have sold although when we say that on our monthly business review is a trend of selling over there, I said no well we still lost one or two customers but it\u2019s not where it was. So I think with the impacts of the ASP change and sequestration the market's probably stabilized. Those who are going to sell or those who were going to merge with another larger practice in the area may have done that.","We didn\u2019t have any Investor Day in December but oncology business we have the oncology supply and ION business which is a big part of specialty. But even within ASP for example which is primarily known for distribution to hospitals is a big oncology segment because they do a lot of the oral oncology programs to ultimate care, mail order specialty pharmacies. So, its complex but oncology permeates not only our specialty business but more and more of our health systems distribution business and also our manufacturer services business, so much of it in the reimbursement and patient programs business even the World Courier clinical trial so much of it is oncology. So, we've always been proud of the oncology franchise AmerisourceBergen has and it\u2019s getting hard and harder to put it into discrete buckets, it truly is a business that permeates the whole of AmerisourceBergen movement. Tim I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that?","Tim Guttman","Steve, I would just say that it was a pleasant surprise to have some good top-line growth and better than what we expected combination of pricing trends in the market and volumes increasing with existing customers and a couple of wins. So, equally across those three translated to good growth and on community oncology. So, we are thrilled. ","Garen Sarafian","Okay, fair enough. A follow-up, maybe a bigger-picture question on selling generics. Now that you are approaching two years into being a part of the purchasing alliance and more recently onboarding Walgreens generics business, that might be impacting -- or has impacted your volume pricing tiers. Do you now have the full lowest-cost generic pricing assumptions baked into your bid? So I guess in other words, with your new pricing, are you able to demonstrate savings on a per-unit basis to your entire book today? Or is it still more of perhaps on an all-in basis, including carrying costs, warehousing, so on and so forth? ","Steve Collis","I should decide going back to the question before, we looks at all of our retail customers we are doing more specialty including oncology drugs, but also we talked earlier about the hepatitis drugs. ","So again I think the generic profile we have it\u2019s worth mentioning, we have our other generic portfolio where we service contracts on behalf of our customers and this is important business for us and the largest player in thereby far is Walgreens and then we have our PRO Gen formulary which contracts with WBAD. But our goal is to have competitive pricing everyday but also make sure that there is continuity of supply because again if there any products that our customers and ultimately their patients are going to access, this is very debilitating to patient care.","So we focus both on price and on quality and I think ABC does a great job. I can tell you we are adding more and more resources into this kind of business intelligence area to make sure that we have price and quality that our customers are demanding. ","So, I don\u2019t have a perfect answer for you. I'll just would tell you that, that always is a great fascination to me. I think that\u2019s a right word, how dynamic the generic business is. The pricing, ins and outs, changes what goes on now with patents is becoming more and more obtuse. Nexium is another great example of how difficult this has been to forecast. ","So I just would say it\u2019s a very dynamic market. I think our customers are giving us good adherence, we are getting good compliance. It can always be better, we are not happy; we'd like it to be even higher. This is something that we pay attention to not on a daily basis, virtually on a daily basis, it is Tim's favorite area. I think he is involved with the generic cargo all the time. So this is something that is a great fascination and I think it\u2019s a very strong area for ABC and it\u2019s probably one of the key areas of opportunity but also where we've done very well with the partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance. ","Operator","We will go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Eric Percher ","A question on the Walgreens relationship, now that you've got the volume on, you're seeing benefits, we've got Ornella on the Board. I am curious to hear what the next set of initiatives look like. I know it's been about a year since you rolled out the latest iteration of the Good Neighbor Pharmacy, and at that point you were talking about leveraging Walgreens' expertise. I have to imagine that within Specialty, given their specialty pharmacy and the international reach, that must be of interest. I'd also be interested on BluePoint and Almus, and whether there is any cross-pollination in the books of business? ","Steve Collis","Thanks Eric your [indiscernible] Larry's proud of the question. But we really are pleased that the Walgreens Boots Alliance merger is complete, obviously that was just done at the end of last month. ","Since then we've had a good redemption of dialogue with Walgreens Boot Alliance, at the top-level because we -- obviously they had a lot going on the last that two quarters or three quarters. So we are very positive about the opportunities. I think Ornella and I have served on IPW Board for many years together. She is extremely experienced. Alphega has over the 7,000 community pharmacy members. So our Good Neighbor Pharmacy is about 4,500 we think it is an opportunity on contracting, we think that private label Almus, is something we are working hard on. You would expect that we should have more clarity over the next couple of quarters but it\u2019s a great passion for Ornella, it\u2019s a great passion for ABC and we are really proud of how well BluePoint has done and I think it\u2019s paved the way for a stronger private label offering for the combine family of companies as we go get our market position. Tim anything you\u2019d add.","Tim Guttman","No I just think that probably first on the list as you mentioned Steve is looking at private label getting another choice to our customer goods, a good generic product offering. And I think that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ll focus over the next few months.","Eric Percher ","Are there specific areas? I know early on, injectables was mentioned with BluePoint Labs. So are there areas where BluePoint is going to be quite strong and you look to leverage Almus? How do you see them working next to each other? ","Steve Collis","Well I think with U.S private label products, there is also -- we want to make sure that there is a need in the market for that. I don\u2019t think the intention is they were meant to be a comprehensive portfolio products that a lot of our manufacturer partners have is typically during mature products, injectables is an area of interest obviously if you have institutional customers that's much more of an area of focus. ","So we do see that the experience that we\u2019ve gained from BluePoint and the sourcing in Ireland and the global relationships in fact our new AmerisourceBergen Switzerland office, this is an area of great promise. And also Walgreens has a strong specialty presence, so we think and our health systems business, so this is a natural area for us. ","Other areas we could look at is three 3PL. Tim highlighted earlier the success of ICS. There certainly are comparable offerings on the lines wholesale side which seems there could be a much strong bond there, and a much stronger offering which we have worked on. And in fact there have been a couple of manufacturers that we made proposals to on joint servicing. So we look forward to more of those type of opportunities. ","Operator","Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Gill ","Thank you. Steve, I had a bigger-picture question. You had mentioned earlier that the overall market growth has been stronger than expected. Can you just give us an indication as to where you are seeing the US pharmaceutical market growth rates today? ","Steven Collis","I do think, it just seems like there is some pick up from the economy. I think just as people get covered more it\u2019s really, really hard to diagnosis exactly. But we\u2019ve talked I think just a couple of weeks at your conference I said one to two maybe its 2% to 3% overall growth rate and pick up from an affordable pay as well as the economy and just greater coverage. ","And then the hepatitis C drugs have been huge. I mean, they've probably added 3% to 4% and we don\u2019t see at least based on the last quarter an adoption of Elisio and the new therapies that we just go and see it backing off, it\u2019s very strong segment for us and our customers. And I met one of our customers recently and they said to me, I said what can we do to better job, they said we need more credit for our stores. Because they\u2019re doing more and hep C patients and you get a couple of hep C patients and it totally changes the dynamics. The market is robust. I think we go mainly off the IMS forecast, so I forget what exactly the latest forecast they have for this year is but it's pretty healthy out there. ","Frankly Lisa just not to change gears on you, but we are very interested in development internationally particularly our specialty franchise and we\u2019re seeing some progress in Brazil with our specialty JV although the problems in the Brazilian overall retail market and economy are well noted. But it\u2019s just one of the great things about MWI is how strong the U.S business is, it\u2019s such a good mix there and we see such strong trends in the U.S based market. So although we liked the international development opportunity, that's another opportunity we liked about MWIs. How strong they are leveraged to the U.S health market.","Lisa Gill ","Then my second follow-up question, you mentioned biosimilars and the opportunities for AmerisourceBergen as it relates to biosimilars. Can you talk about, Steve, what you would expect the relationships to look like? Would you expect early type of partnerships signed with new biosimilars coming to market? And what are the services that you think Amerisource will provide? And do you anticipate that will have more limited type distribution? Where you talked for example with oncology that the manufacturers really want to control the channel; would you expect it to be similar to that in biosimilars? ","Steve Collis","Yes it\u2019s a great question and thank you for bringing this up. We think that it\u2019s going to be great for patients and physician choice. We think the pricing for biosimilars should be such that you are not going to have jailbreak type events, I think Tim referred to Nexium. So you'd see a few really, really well credential, well capitalized manufacturers. And again these products are being successfully distributed, dispensed in Europe. So we are going to be working with companies that we are very used to working with the top four or five global manufacturers, that are used to buying services from AmerisourceBergen and from our type or trade.","And then a lot of the key products will be physician administered products. So this is an area of strength for us. We know how to work on the pricing issues, on the market acceptance issues, on the contracting issues, on the reimbursement issues. This is -- I was out in Washington a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s a question we\u2019re getting asked our regulators a lot more so. We think that the pricing environment will be favorable for the type of services that AmerisourceBergen offers to manufacturers and also it will be of interest to our customers and I think they will be interested in extending the options for patients care. Of course we also want to work with existing manufacturers. So, we think that overall neutrality and greater access and choices is always a benefit to the market.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Ransom","Hi, good morning. Yes, you guys have been busy over the last five years, it comes to mind. Would you mind just making sure that we grasp all this? Just resetting your comments on Nexium and why you -- even though it's probably going to launch earlier, why you are less optimistic about the contribution. Is it the fact that it's not exclusive? Or is there something else that we might be missing there? Thanks","Tim Guttman","John it\u2019s Tim, thanks for the question, it\u2019s an important one. It\u2019s significant brand drug and we had it factored into our plan. As you know it's a fairly large contributor this year in \u201915 but you\u2019re absolutely right, economics are better when it\u2019s exclusive and that was our working assumption, when we built our plan and when we gave guidance earlier in the year. ","As Steve mentioned he used that phrase jailbreak, I mean there's been some recent news about one manufacturer potentially coming to market but there seems to be several kind of in the queue that maybe right after them. And usually history shows us when there are several too many manufacturers, the margin falls a lot faster. So that\u2019s why we called it out and it\u2019s a little bit of a headwind for us in the second half.","Steve Collis","Also we [Technical Difficulty] the news on Monday afternoon so right as we were busy getting ready for this call and we were doing our first rehearsal so the top of the timing -- but I don\u2019t think we would have seen anything different because there is no definitive information out there, very important product for us and most of the brand sales are very important particularly to one of our largest customer. So they\u2019ll have an impact on our brand sales as well.","John Ransom","And just one other -- I know how you guys are talking about individual drugs. So on that theme, could you just talk a little bit more specifically about -- we talked about biosimilars in particular. But is the biosimilar for the anemia products, is that -- do you have that in your model as making any material contribution this year? Or if so, how do you think about it -- not this year, I'm sorry, but how do you think about the biosimilars for particularly your dialysis franchise and your oncology franchise? Are those likely to be needle-movers in your opinion? ","Steve Collis","In oncology we\u2019ll probably have better economics again because of the services that we provide. Dialysis we\u2019ve got two extremely large -- two large customers that make a lot of the on-formulary decisions. But we\u2019d expect to work within whatever their formulary charges are. ","The first Neupogen, the first biosimilar we will -- it is a product that we distributed overall about $1 billion product and probably ABC has more than a third share of that. And I am not quite sure exactly how it falls into community oncology business. But we do have fairly significant contributions expected from it because we expect that there will be an interest from our physician customers but nothing needle moving, just not a big enough product.","John Ransom","Okay, thanks very much.","Barbara Brungess","Thanks John. Well, time for one more question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Ross Muken with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken","Thanks, guys. So just again on -- I just got a bunch of questions before in my inbox on the generic inflation assumption. I think the challenge here is just that that timing aspect continues to be pretty difficult to predict. But I guess as you made your commentary around the rest of the year, there is nothing in the way that you are seeing things from manufacturers changing; this is just a more a view that -- you had an assumption about what the year would look like. We've already gotten off maybe a slightly better start, and so you're being conservative in assuming it flat-lines for the remainder. Is there something maybe you're actually seeing in the market? Or is it one of the specific comps? We did have a very active, I think, calendar Q2 last year. I'm just trying to put all of that in context. ","Tim Guttman","So we did get off to a good start in a quarter that\u2019s traditionally low but then we came to a little bit of a screeching halt here in January with not much activity. So we\u2019re a little concerned about what the March calendar will bear. And again with some of that pull forward into December, we don\u2019t know we just need more time to assess. So I think we\u2019re still optimistic about the year in total as what we\u2019ve communicated in the past, the total contribution. And I think we just need more time to assess.","A - Barbara Brungess","Steve do you have any closing comments.","Steve Collis","So, just thank you for your attention and really great questions today. That really wraps up our Q1 call. This was certainly a quarter with all of our core themes of knowledge, reach and partnership translated into strong strategic and financial performance. We are very enthusiastic about our business and we look forward to working hard to continue to enhance the value we provide to all of our stakeholders. Thank you.

Steve?","Steve Collis","Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am pleased to talk about AmerisourceBergen\u2019s continued strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. On this call, I will highlight how our business remains well positioned for the long-term growth and how AmerisourceBergen unites the stakeholders across the healthcare supply chain as a solutions provider and good corporate citizen.","First our fiscal 2019 second quarter financial performance. Revenues were up solid 6% to $43.3 billion per quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS was $2.11 for the second quarter, an increase of 9% compared to the previous fiscal year period. We are extremely pleased with our performance in the second quarter, which was driven by solid growth in customer volumes, double-digit Specialty distribution growth and overall strong execution across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health Groups.","I first want to thank our 21,000 associates who are really driving our performance. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of their dedication, solution oriented mindset, focus and passion for our customers and partners and I consider it a privilege to work alongside them every day. Our teams are executing well across our robust portfolio of businesses as we continue to enhance the experience and value that we provide for our customers and partners in the industry.","Our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services team notably in specialty physician services and health systems continue to deepen their customer relationships and seek new ways to unlock value for our partners while enabling patient access to pharmaceuticals. Finally, we\u2019re proud of how our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group continues to execute, grow and deliver differentiated services for pharmaceutical manufacturers and veterinarians.","Next an update on our comprehensive strategic and financial review for PharMEDium. As part of this process, we determined that the best way to maximize the value of the business was to close PharMEDium\u2019s smallest and least automated facility and consolidate production into the businesses remaining two open facilities to service customers more efficiently and effectively. We believe that decision should optimize the business more appropriately for the long-term, while ensuring that PharMEDium\u2019s focus remains on patient safety and delivering the safest and highest quality products.","In addition, as you may recall, we engage a cGMP expert consulting firm to help us with our review of this business unit. After taken into consideration, PharMEDium enhanced quality assurance and quality control procedures and independent evaluations from our cGMP consulting firm and the business unit\u2019s new president, we have determined that it will be difficult for PharMEDium\u2019s overall volumes to return to previous levels in the next few years.","In addition to our internal review, we have continued discussions with regulators and based on discussions to-date, we expect to enter into a consent decree in the June quarter. Subject to the successful completion of third party orders, we anticipate the consent decree would allow commercial distribution to continue at the two open compounding facilities.","Additionally, we expect that a consent decree with specified requirements that must be satisfied prior to resumption of commercial operations at the Memphis facility. Based on these update, Jim will provide more details in his comments regarding PharMEDium\u2019s financial outlook. However, despite this challenge and as evidenced by this quarter\u2019s results, AmerisourceBergen continues to execute and deliver strong growth and performance. Our differentiated strategic and \u2013 our differentiated strategy investments have positioned us to continued delivering long-term sustainable growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","At the core of our strategy remains a clearly defined pharmaceutical centric focus. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, which was driven by strong patient demographics and prescription utilization gains as well as pharmaceutical innovation across brand, specialty and biosimilars. In fact, the specialty market is experiencing significant growth and an increasing number of breakthrough medicines continue to improve the current standards of care.","Our undisputed leadership position in specialty distribution and services places AmerisourceBergen at the forefront of this rapidly growing market segments. While we report Distribution and Commercialization Services in separate segments, together they represent our extensive footprint and comprehensive portfolio in specialty that we have built through decades of significant organic and inorganic strategic investments. Our expertise and capabilities empower us to support the complex solutions needed in both Specialty Distribution and pre and post Commercialization Services.","Specialty Distribution, which includes oncology and physician administered products continued its double-digit growth in a second fiscal quarter, as we continue to create value for our customers. This part of the U.S. healthcare market is growing well as patient utilization of these life-altering medications continues to increase. The efficiency of the distribution channels we enable combined with key services and solutions we provide our physician practice customers, our core reasons why AmerisourceBergen remains the preferred partner of choice.","For example, Besse Medical extends AmerisourceBergen\u2019s reach and relationship to over 65,000 non-oncology community physician sites, accelerating access to the products, insights, technology and guide needed to elevate their practice performance and patients experience.","On the commercialization side, we continue to increase the depth and span of our manufacturer services. Make it ourselves the essential partner for the global pharmaceutical industry. For example, World Courier, the most trusted specialty logistics partner in the world of its high-quality and innovative services, which provide that customized support and flexibility and manufacturers value, clinical trial logistics and commercial services such as those needed in cell and gene therapy.","World Korea continues to move innovation forward to recent technology in packaging advancements, like NOVA and Cocoon, which deliver increased efficiencies and enhance experience for their customers, empower their sustained growth and demand for their services. In the years ahead, the strong pipeline of innovative and complex specialty products and increasing number of biosimilars in the market should further increase demand with an innovative distribution and commercialization services that we provide for our partners.","AmerisourceBergen applies the same innovative masthead towards all opportunities or issues that arise across this dynamic and exciting health care landscape. Our ongoing investments in state-of-the-art services and solutions continues to differentiate our business and enable new value-creation opportunities for our partners, customers and the entire health care supply chain.","Likewise, our focus on driving data connectivity throughout all our offerings further distinguishes our ability to meet the evolving needs of our stakeholders and solidify AmerisourceBergen\u2019s position as a trusted data company in our industry that stakeholders depend upon to help them deliver care and improve efficiency at scale. As an industry, AmerisourceBergen [indiscernible] secure nationwide supply chain that produces reliable, accessible and transparent data and analytics that consistently deliver value for our stakeholders.","For example, manufacturers value and trust data generated by AmerisourceBergen, which enables them to proactively manage their daily services and their daily service and inventory levels. On the other end of the supply chain, our unique set of analytics tools empowers 4,600 pharmacies and our Elevate Provider Network with solutions that help pharmacies maximize profitability, improve operational effectiveness and enhance patients\u2019 care. We take great pride in our responsibility as a trusted data source and our role as a solutions provider in the supply chain.","With this solutions oriented approach in mind, we continue to believe there\u2019s a facilitation role that we can play if the U.S. health care system shifts to one where patients needed access to discounted pharmaceutical prices in the pharmacy at the point-of-sale. Given our fundamental tools and trusted relationships, we believe AmerisourceBergen and its Pharmaceutical Distribution peers would be best positioned to support the transition. Our existing capabilities and proven experience managing and maintaining complex contract administration and charge-back systems today provide the necessary building blocks the operationalize a charge-back system to handle point-of-sale discounts in the pharmacy \u2013 pharmaceutical distributors\u2019 existing relationships built on fairness and trust with their pharmacy customers and manufacturer partners, position distributors to approach this potential reform with solutions that are fair, efficient and transparent.","With support of industry alignment, AmerisourceBergen is ready to play a role in pursuing a distributor facilitator model. This unique opportunity will further embody AmerisourceBergen\u2019s purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. In fact, our purpose is the driving force behind everything we do. As a company, AmerisourceBergen recognizes the importance of strong corporate citizenship as a cornerstone to long-term shareholder value creation. We are especially excited by the continued progress and development detailed within this year\u2019s Corporate Citizenship Report, which follows externally accepted standards for sustainability reporting and is our most comprehensive report to date. Here are a few highlights.","First, we have invested in two solar energy pilot projects located at our distribution centers and introduced several packaging innovation solutions that help reduce weight and energy usage in our efforts to improve the sustainability of our operations. In addition to help enhance our inclusion project where our associates respect and support one another, we launched the Connect With Respect campaign and supported colleagues impacted by hurricanes and wildfires through our Associate Assistance Fund.","Finally, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation, an independent, not-for-profit, charitable-giving organization continues to invest in health-related causes that help increase health care access for human and animal populations and ensure prescription drug safety. As a distributor of pharmaceutical products, AmerisourceBergen manages the transportation of medication, including controlled substances from manufacturers to licensed providers. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and work to combat opioid abuse by ensuring safe and secure distribution, maintaining operational integrity and advocating for the highest regulatory standard and community outreach.","All of this, in addition to reporting all controlled substance orders to the DEA and holding suspicious orders. AmerisourceBergen and the AmerisourceBergen Foundation are committed to making a difference in our communities and providing communities across the country resources to combat the epidemic of opioid misuse. Together, our 21,000 associates, Board of Directors and partners will continue to further our efforts, collectively working to boost our reach and improve across our communities and the supply chain to create a healthier future for all.","In closing, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to continue creating shareholder value and delivering long-term sustainable growth. We\u2019re proud of our ability to execute evolve and transform our business, to meet the needs of our partners, drive value for our stakeholders, and ultimately even patients \u2013 and ultimately serve patients. We won\u2019t be complacent.

We have the utmost confidence that our differentiated strategy will created sustained long term venue for our stakeholders. More than ever, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier future and as always, we appreciate AmerisourceBergen.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results and our upward revision to fiscal 2019 EPS guidance. Jim?","Jim Cleary","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. My remarks today will focus only on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release.","As we have reached the halfway point of our fiscal year, we are extremely proud of the execution throughout AmerisourceBergen to deliver strong results. Our continued strong performance is especially impressive given that this quarter still has a notable year-over-year headwind from PharMEDium. Looking ahead, we expect to last any notable headwind to beginning in the June quarter.","Before I discuss our results this morning, I want to first take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we have taken for PharMEDium. Based on the current analysis of the business, we now expect that PharMEDium will have lower volumes due to the implementation of enhanced QA\/QC procedures and the continued closure of Memphis. This conclusion was reached in accordance with the evaluations of PharMEDium\u2019s new President in our CGMP consulting firm.","As part of the comprehensive, strategic and financial review, we updated our long-term outlook at quarter end. We continue to see that there is a demand for compounded sterile preparations, but given the estimated production limitations over the next few years, we determined that the estimated undiscounted future cashflows indicates that the assets should have a lower carrying value. We used a variety of scenarios with probability waiting to make this determination.","We subsequently performed a fair value tests using discounted cash flows to determine the asset impairment amount of $570 million. After a consent decree is finalized, PharMEDium expects to have further clarity on the remediation requirements to reopen Memphis and maintain the other facilities and operation, as well as the overall production ramp pace expectations.","As a reminder, PharMEDium is expected to be a headwind of about 3% in fiscal 2019. And this represents an adjusted operating income loss of about $50 million for fiscal 2019. For comparison purposes, PharMEDium had only a small operating income profit in fiscal 2018, down from a significant operating income profit in fiscal 2017.","Turning now to discuss our second quarter results and the continued strong execution by AmerisourceBergen. I will provide commentary in two main areas this morning. First, I\u2019ll detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I\u2019ll cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance.","Moving now to our second quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11, an increase of 9%, primarily due to higher operating income, lower net interest expense, and a lower share count. I will note that there were some positives, general and administrative expense items that just in the second quarter and has been expected to be realized later in the year.","Our consolidated revenue was $43.3 billion up 6%, primarily driven by strong revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.3 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 1.5% to $702 million. As a reminder, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, there were some true ups related to the accounting for recognizing PharMEDium\u2019s remediation costs, which impacted both costs of good sold and operating expenses.","Normalizing for those adjustments last year, our gross profit this quarter would have increased 3.8%, while our operating expenses would have increased 2.6%. These items net out and has no impact on the operating income comparison. As it relates to operating expenses this quarter, we have solid overall expense management, as we continue to be focus on effectively managing operating expenses throughout the business.","Additionally, the positive general and administrative expense items that I referred to earlier represent roughly $0.05 of EPS in the quarter. Expense management is so important in the healthcare industry and it\u2019s especially impressive that our teams were able to execute on expense management, while delivering strong customer service and continuing to ensure safe, secure and efficient patient access to care.","Consolidated operating income was $617 million, up 5% with our operating margin, essentially flat. As we had previously highlighted, we expect the March quarter to mark the last significant headwinds or operating income related to PharMEDium. That headwind was offset this quarter by strong results from our consolidated businesses in Brazil, which we expect to normalize in the third quarter.","If you were to exclude both PharMEDium and consolidated Brazil, our consolidated operating income growth would still have been 5% held by the lower than expected operating expenses in the quarter as I discussed earlier. Net interest expense increase $5 million to $43 million, due to an increase in interest income. Given strong cash flow year-to-date and the better than expected interest income, we now expect our net interest expense to be lower than originally anticipated.","Moving now to income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 21.5% up slightly from the prior year quarter, due primarily to some relatively small discrete items. As a reminder, the prior year order tax rate did reflect the benefit from tax reform. Our diluted share count decreased 4% to 213 million shares, in the quarter we purchased approximately $100 million of our shares and now have roughly $800 million remaining on the November 2018 share repurchase authorization.","Year-to-date, we have now repurchased $325 million of shares, bringing our total share repurchases in the last four quarters to over $900 million. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, year-to-date we had adjusted free cash flow of $803 million putting us right on track with our guidance for the full year adjusted free cash flow of between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Although the timing of free cash flow was earlier in the year than expected. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash of which $520 million with held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash.","This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I\u2019ll cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $42 billion up 6%. This segment continues to benefit from growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong growth in specialty distribution and overall market growth. Segment operating income increased about 6% to $517 million.","As discussed earlier, the March quarter had a headwind from PharMEDium, but was offset by the favorability related to Brazil. Normalizing for both of these impacts, segment operating income still would have increased 6%. Our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses continue to execute extremely well growing volumes with our customers, while effectively managing operating expenses.","Our teams are working with partners both upstream and downstream to deepen existing relationships and deliver outstanding services and solutions, all while working diligently to operate the most efficient distribution network.","I\u2019ll now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on global commercialization services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting, and MWI.","In the quarter, total revenue was $1.7 billion, up 5%, primarily due to growth at Consulting\u2019s Canadian operations and World Courier. Consulting\u2019s Canadian operations, or Innomar, has had solid growth as it continues to deliver innovative solutions to the specialty manufacturers, while improving product access and increasing supply chain efficiency in the Canadian market.","World Courier had strong revenue growth as demand for their high touch global specialty logistics continues to be strong. MWI\u2019s revenue was up 2% limited by severe winter conditions impacting customers on the production animal side of the business.","From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $100 million up 3%. World Courier continued its strong momentum with strong volume and weight growth trends. The groups operating income growth rate is increasing as expected, as we continued to drive cost efficiencies across the group and we anticipate solid growth at MWI in the back half of the year.","While fiscal 2019 continues to be a transition year for Lash. We\u2019re excited for the long-term outlook of the business, as we have had notable success and winning new business in addition to having key anchor manufacturer relationships renewed or adding programs. The fusion platform and continues to be a differentiator for Lash\u2019s service offering and positions the business well for the long-term.","This completes the review of our segment results. So now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal 2019 guidance. As we said in this morning\u2019s press release, we are raising our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.90, up from $6.65 to $6.85, as our businesses continue to execute at a high level, despite the headwind from PharMEDium. The only other guidance item we are updating this morning is a minor change to our expectation for weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year.","Given the buyback so far this year, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to approximately 214 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 215 million shares for the year. Lastly, we are not making any changes to our working assumptions around pharmaceutical pricing for the full fiscal year. Broadly speaking, after the first half of the year, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year, but I\u2019ll note that it\u2019s still relatively early in our fiscal year.","Turning back to our guidance range overall, factors that move us within our range include, business unit performance, operating expense management, brand and generic pricing and mix results from PharMEDium, and H. D. Smith synergy capture. Based on how we are evaluating these factors today, we are less likely to be at the bottom of our range.","Regarding the expected cadence for our adjusted EPS for the rest of the year, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that certain expense items referenced earlier were initially expected to benefit the third quarter, but actually benefited the March quarter. Keep that in mind, as you adjust your quarterly models for the rest of the year to align with our updated full year guidance.","In closing, we\u2019re extremely proud of the execution throughout AmerisourceBergen to deliver continued strong results. AmerisourceBergen has spent decades evolving to become the enterprise we are today, having built a robust portfolio of businesses and capabilities, attracting and developing talent and fostering key customer relationships all along maintaining strong financial discipline and investing internally and externally to ensure we are offering our partners unparalleled value and efficiency.","Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now here\u2019s Bennett to start our Q&A.","Bennett Murphy","Operator, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, Jim, just wanting to sort of follow-up on the gross margins within the core distribution business. I mean, you\u2019ve given us some color about the Brazilian piece and PharMEDium maybe offsetting what happened in Brazil. But the gross margin came in a little bit better than what we were looking for. And I was wondering if you could help us unpack what\u2019s going on there, so we can help us better assess the sustainability of that trend.","And then I\u2019ll just get my follow-up out of the way. The biggest question we\u2019re getting from investors is about the reimbursement pressures at retail pharmacies and how that may be impacting the independent pharmacy channel and what that could mean for wholesaler economics over the intermediate and longer term. So any thoughts on those two issues would be helpful.","Jim Cleary","Yes. Glen, thanks for the questions. This is Jim, and I\u2019ll answer the first question. And then Steve will take the second question. So regarding margins, as I talk about the quarter, I\u2019ll focus on operating margin. And let me kind of take a step back and first say from a big-picture standpoint that we feel confident that our value proposition is high and we are in a fair margin. And our margins are clearly justified by the services we provide, including logistics and access and efficiency and financing and security.","And now kind of getting into the quarter, in our distribution business, you asked about revenues were up 6% and operating margin was up 6%. And as you noted as we adjust out the headwind from PharMEDium and the tailwind that we had this particular quarter from Brazil, operating income and distribution was still up 6%. And I\u2019d call out a couple of things. There was good performance across many business units. But one particular that I\u2019ll call out is growth in specialty distribution, which there are added services that we provide, wraparound services that we provide, in particular to physicians.","And that\u2019s really benefited us during the quarter and played out in our operating margin and operating income growth. And the other thing I\u2019ll call out during the quarter is just really good performance on expense management. We had very nice performance there in the quarter. One thing I will call out though, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were about $0.05 during the quarter of general and administrative expense benefits that we received during the quarter that we had expected to receive over the balance of the year. And so that did help us in the quarter.","But overall, we\u2019re really pleased with our performance and really pleased with our operating income growth and our operating margin. And then of course, one thing that will benefit us on that front in future quarters is we really lapped the tough PharMEDium comparisons and the comparisons don\u2019t have that notable headwinds going forward that \u2013 we don\u2019t expect them down the notable headwinds going forward as we have in past quarters.","Steve Collis","Yes, thanks. Glen, on the second question, really around reimbursement pressure, our customers \u2013 it really depends a lot \u2013 informs a lot by your contracting strategy. So particularly, if you\u2019re in narrow networks, you know when we do the Elevate work, for example, it\u2019s really important that we take into account the manageability of contract rates that we have got for Elevate. And we have a lot of discussions with our independent base that we contract on behalf of all that. There is a lot of talk. I think you\u2019re referencing can independents survive in this environment?","And we\u2019re seeing independents\u2019 market share remains fairly consistent. I think because of the differentiated service they provide, the communities that they\u2019re in, their role as a local health care petitioner, very accessible. I think they work very hard. And there\u2019s a continuity of service there that, I think, a lot of patients are very fond of, so \u2013 and then I think ourselves, our industry has been very helpful to the overall growth and survivability of the independent pharmacists. And they have other key partners like fine groups.","But the services we offer them, including analytics, technology, professional services, sourcing services, are very critical to their survival. And we think that they do differentiate them. And we in particular think that being a Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate member differentiates you further within that important subset. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Thanks for the questions. I guess just to pick up on the first question for you, Jim. Even if I account for that $0.05 of the positive G&A that you highlighted, it still seems like based on your original expectations for this quarter to be flat to last quarter obviously came in much better, it seems like the implied back half is lower than what you guys would have been anticipating before the results today. So I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any other dynamics at play there that you could share.","And then to Steve, my follow-up would be you\u2019ve mentioned now a few times about ABC and the wholesalers being a facilitator of the flow of funds in a potential point-of-sale discount world. So just wanted to get a sense from you, now that we\u2019re a quarter later, what are you hearing out of D.C.? And how significant of a revenue and profit stream could this be for ABC and the group? Thanks.","Jim Cleary","Okay. Thanks. And I will again answer the first question and then Steve will answer the second question. Regarding what we are seeing over the balance of the year, I mean, of course, it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, and we\u2019ve increased our guidance range, of course, to $6.70 to $6.90. And as we look at the balance of the year, the factors that move us within the range, our business unit performance, operating expense management, brand and generic pricing, results from PharMEDium and H. D. Smith synergy capture probably are the ones that are a little bit less under our control, but of course, with the brand and generic pricing, and to some extent, the results from PharMEDium, given the negotiation of the consent decree.","But as I said during the prepared remarks, based on how we\u2019re evaluating all those factors today, we are less likely to be at the bottom of our range. And then one other thing I\u2019ll just call out that I think is important to consider, when we did our guidance at the beginning of the year, the low end of our range was $6.65. And I think it\u2019s important for members that we indicated that what would move us to the low end of that range was the downside scenario at PharMEDium of not reopening Memphis. And that is the current expectation. And so we\u2019ve been able to overcome that and increase our guidance range due to strong execution across numerous AmerisourceBergen businesses. But again, I\u2019ll comment that it is still pretty early in the fiscal year.","Steve Collis","Yes. Bob, thanks for the question. And one thing that I would start say, I\u2019d much rather \u2013 everything that I \u2013 we work very hard on balancing our portfolio to make sure that all the products are profitable. And we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. And we\u2019ve been talking about that for years. And I think that state approved, we\u2019re not where we\u2019d like to be entirely. But we obviously had an effort just to be very frank to make sure that generics and generics with the deflation, not a growing, robust part of our portfolio as a headwind in the past, that this was not as much of a headwind.","And I think you\u2019ve seen some of that play out. Just on the question about distributors and adjudication, great question. I\u2019m really proud of the team. I mean the way we brainstorm there, you talk about the work that gets done between information resources \u2013 to give you a glimpse into the inner workings of the company, the work that was done here before we could put out the release between information resources, our digital people and our core business operations to elevate people, I think it\u2019s really amongst the finest thinking that we\u2019ve done in a long time just to think about the future, look at the problems and be proactive about putting a solution out there.","Having said that, it still is not a clear picture. There needs to be tremendous cooperation amongst all \u2013 some of the industry stakeholders. I do think that sometimes people will get that not all products are heavily rebated. We\u2019re talking about a category of products, which is fairly large and have specific characterizations around how they get prescribed and how patients utilize them and how they get dispensed and how manufacturers are negotiating with PBMs and other insurance parties.","So I think that\u2019s important. But we are positive about our role. I think we\u2019ve been quite confident, intellectually confident to state that we can perform this service that\u2019s analogous to some other services we provide. But it\u2019s more complex because we have to take a data feed from payers and claims. So we stand ready to do that work. We need help and we need alignment that the wholesalers are the right party to do that. We have a strong faith and confidence that we can do that because we are an honest, neutral party. And we do this in the institutional setting very frequently.","So it\u2019s not that a big of a stretch for us. And we have these strong relationships that we can leverage. And I think that over time, I\u2019ve been saying for a long time that it\u2019s inevitable that companies like AmerisourceBergen will have a stronger payer\/patient relationship in terms of the services we provide to payers. So maybe that\u2019s part of the evolution of the market, and we look forward to playing that role.","Robert Jones","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. So maybe just sticking on sort of the independents theme, obviously you are a partner and WBAD talked about less generic procurement savings this year and maybe a slightly tougher environment. Obviously, less generic deflation is also good for you guys. But just in terms of your independent customers, we\u2019ve heard more anecdotally and after seeing some of the numbers from NCPA there\u2019s \u2013 given some of the issues with DIR fees and other things, the independent base is seeking sort of better generic procurement and sourcing than what they have had.","And obviously, those two things kind of go against each other in terms of what the environment is and what they need. And so in the guise of keeping this important customer base kind of healthy, I guess how do you kind of balance what you can kind of provide to them, maybe incremental services, maybe they need you more than they did in the past versus sort of that push and pull of what the generic market is offering today?","Steve Collis","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So WBAD is now six years old. I mean just to remind everyone, in 2013, we joined the alliance that has already been created between Walgreens and Alliance Boots at that time. And we think that it\u2019s been very successful. In fact, historically, it narrows the gap tremendously between how independents with sourced generics versus how chains can. And I think if you look back, that really does help very well into theme that I\u2019ve talked about, about how important wholesalers have been for the overall survival of independents.","So we look at these statistics very carefully. And there\u2019s a juxtaposition, if you wanted to take, between what our generic profitability is and what our compliance rates are. And we\u2019ve talked about that. We are obsessed with our compliance rates and our independents feel that we\u2019re giving them a fair deal as we all look maintaining our profitability in this important segment of the business. So that is something that we\u2019re very aware of. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s new to us. It\u2019s always been the stance. But we are confident in the value proposition that we provide to Good Neighbor Pharmacy and to all of our customers. And we are aware reimbursement pressure and other health care policy pressures are \u2013 it\u2019s nothing \u2013 it\u2019s not new to us.","We have been engaging in these discussions and have been proactive more and more in those discussions with our key customers as well as our suppliers so that we can help really plan for about managing through changes. The DIR fees, you referenced those, those were a surprise. About three years ago when I went to our Vegas trade show, I was really surprised at the intensity of the independent base about that.","And we really try to help. And I think people are in a much \u2013 pharmacies are in much better position now to understand what the exposure to DIR fees could be and to manage that accordingly. So we feel that some of those things have not necessarily, in my opinion, been fair. But we\u2019ve been able to help our base manage through that. So thank you, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next will come from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. So just a question here around generic pricing. Obviously, it\u2019s very topical right now. Thinking back about four or five years ago when drug distributors really captured a lot of earnings upside from generics, there were a lot of generics that were going up in price pretty materially, a lot of list price increases. In the current environment, the trends seems to be a little bit more of generic prices stabilizing, not really going down anymore but really not a lot of generics going up in price, at least based on the data that we\u2019re looking at.","So just curious maybe thinking you are able to discuss that at a high level, how important that is when thinking about the potential for distributors to capture incremental profits in the current environment? Thanks.","Jim Cleary","Yes. So regarding generics, what we\u2019re seeing is that the deflation is generally in the range of our original expectations. So when we look at it overall, we see it generally in the range of our original expectations. And as we said at the beginning of the year, as long as that stabilizes and is in that range, we won\u2019t to call out a particular percentage on a quarterly basis. We are hopeful that the commentary from manufacturers on portfolio optimization leads to further stabilization. We\u2019re optimistic over a period of time that the market returns to historic levels of mid-single digits in terms of deflation. And then on supply constraints, we are seeing some volume impacts there. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s just kind of one of the things that we\u2019ve been seeing in the market and relatively small.","Steven Valiquette","I guess at the end of the day, are you seeing a consistent relationship right now between the buy-side generic pricing trend versus the sell-side generic pricing trend? That\u2019s really, I think, what\u2019s critical at the end of the day.","Jim Cleary","Yes. We have been tracking that. And in terms of that spread, we\u2019ve seen that spread as relatively constant.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, perfect. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. Steve, I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could just talk a little about the impact around potential changes on Medicare Part B. You talked about your specialty business and growth there. But do you see incremental opportunities if we start to see changes around reimbursement on the Part B side? Or do you see any risk to your specialty business?","Steve Collis","The specialty business is doing really well at the moment from a key product innovation on the manufacturer side. And if you look at our colleagues reporting, our manufacturer colleagues reporting, so much \u2013 the growth that you\u2019re seeing in some of the larger pharma companies, it is around oncology. And we have this incredible franchise there and, in fact, had some customer wins within that segment. A lot of our customers, which we\u2019ve always talked about, are the consolidators, that are the acquirers.","So we\u2019re seeing some important macro trends pertinent to AmerisourceBergen that Jim referenced within our specialty distribution business. And it\u2019s hard to exactly gauge our market share because of the data \u2013 access to good data. But we think that our distribution market share could have gone up a bit there \u2013 I think invariably ahead because of the growth of our customer base. And as far as that actual Part B goes, we don\u2019t think the reimbursement is really fair right now. I think a lot of the oncologists I\u2019ve talked to really rely on their commercial base. We hope that there could be some changes, there could be beneficial, maybe more around fees.","And there\u2019s some skepticism about the sustainability of those fees. But really, these are nothing that is new that we are overly concerned about as far as Part B. I think what is a positive is that particularly commercial [indiscernible] and hopefully Medicare understand the important role that community oncologists play with patients. Another trend we\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019ve got Part Bs. And more Part Bs drive important areas like ophthalmology, urology, et cetera that is not part of the trend. And that\u2019s why we highlighted the strength in access of our basic medical business. So hopefully, that answers your question and\u2026","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, Jim, when we think about the $800 million that\u2019s left in the share repurchase, you\u2019ve only brought the checkout down by roughly 1 million shares. How do we think about that playing out throughout the rest of this year?","Jim Cleary","Yes. And so as a reminder, we don\u2019t include unidentified capital allocation in the guidance. As we said during the call, we\u2019ve done $900 million worth of share repurchasing over the past four quarters. And we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation. But as I said before, we don\u2019t include unidentified capital allocation in the guidance.","Lisa Gill","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Thanks for taking my call. I want to change it up a little bit and talk about the animal health business. You mentioned the weather had a negative impact on MWI on the production side. And Zoetis this morning called out a miss in their U.S. livestock business partially caused by the timing of distribution or distributor purchases. Is there any of these delays can be pushed into the next quarter, meaning there could be a little bit of a makeup? Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of what\u2019s going on, on the production side for MWI?","Jim Cleary","Yes. And as I said during my prepared remarks, MWI grew 2% during the quarter. In fact, I said that, that was limited because of the severe winter weather. And so companion animal grew faster than production animal during the quarter. And as those of you that follow the animal health business or follow [indiscernible] some of the weather in the Midwest during the second fiscal quarter, it really did have an impact on production animal business. And I\u2019d have to say, to answer your question, some of that is lost and then some of that will kind of flow into the next quarter. I would have to just make an overall comment that sometimes weather impacts that business. It happens from time to time. But overall, over the long-term, we view it as a very positive, very healthy long-term business.","Kevin Caliendo","On the companion side, I know it\u2019s only been a quarter. But has \u2013 have you seen any impact yet from the Covetrus merger, the merger of the Schein and Vets First Choice businesses in the marketplace yet?","Jim Cleary","Yes. Schein and Covetrus are good competitors. We have good competitors in that market and they are one of them. And we\u2019ll just continues to focus on our areas of strength. We\u2019re particularly strong in corporate accounts. We\u2019re particularly strong in our operating efficiency in that business. We have really good value-added services and technologies both in the production animal market and in the companion animal market, a strong sales force. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on our strengths in building the business. But I\u2019m sure that Covetrus will continue to be, as they have been, a strong and good competitor.","Kevin Caliendo","Is there any plans to try to grow out your own platform, just similar to Vets First Choice \u2013 the Vetsource platform?","Jim Cleary","Yes. We are a shareholder of Vetsource. And we\u2019ve been very happy with our interest in that business and partnering with them. And then we have other kind of value-added technologies like [indiscernible] for instance, that we have internally.","Bennett Murphy","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Charlie Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it\u2019s James on for Charles actually. So World Courier seems to be continuing to perform well. If I recall correctly, it was noted previously that you expect operating profit growth there to grow at or in excess of 20% in fiscal 2019. Can you give us some color on like what\u2019s driving that level of growth? Has growth year-to-date been in line with that expectation? And is that sustainable over the longer term beyond fiscal 2019?","Steve Collis","So James, no, we didn\u2019t give \u2013 we don\u2019t give that specific guidance for a business within [indiscernible] But we did have an outstanding year, very high-growth year in 2018 with World Courier. And when a business has two or three back-to-back very strong growth years, we were pleased with the brand they\u2019ve put and they continue to hit their internal milestones, and more importantly provide very important services to their manufacturer partners. So we couldn\u2019t be happier with the business. It\u2019s an international business that\u2019s been a really strong success for us. And we have high confidence in the management there. We\u2019ve made strong internal investments.","It\u2019s a complex business for us to run and operate in 50 countries. And a lot of the value add that ABC has done there, if you look back over a long time, has been strengthening the internal controls, the financials, really helping them with how you cross contracts out. We think that it was always a good business. We\u2019ve added a lot in terms of management, expanded the services and helped just manage and inform the business data. So I think it\u2019s a great case study within ABC for what is a successful acquisition.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And can you provide us with an update on Lash maybe, particularly the Fusion implementation? How is Lash tracking towards return to growth in fiscal 2020?","Jim Cleary","Yes. So we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that Lash is making. From a financial standpoint, it\u2019s still a transition year for Lash. But they\u2019re doing really well in terms of new business development and new business wins and signing extensions and adding the programs with existing customers. And we really feel strongly about Fusion for the current and for the long term and the benefits that it will have for Lash and for manufacturers and patients.","Bennett Murphy","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi. Good morning. So Jim, a two-part question. But first, Jim, when we talk about the $0.05 benefit in the quarter from the lower operating expenses, should we think about this as a sustainable benefit that we can both run a model going forward or is just kind of like more of a onetime item? And then for Steve, I just wanted to revisit the WBAD question. I mean obviously, your largest customer and sourcing partner has highlighted some meaningful headwind for them from lower generic sourcing benefit. So what are you seeing on your end? How are you mitigating it? I know you responded before that the \u2013 you\u2019re seeing the sell versus buy-side spread being stable. Should we interpret that as you\u2019re actually getting better pricing from the sell-side?","Jim Cleary","Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. The $0.05 of G&A benefits during the quarter is really timing. And it\u2019s things that we expected to happen throughout the balance of the fiscal year, particularly in the third quarter, that ended up benefiting us in the second quarter.","Steve Collis","Yes. On WBAD, I think we have a very \u2013 the relationship really works because of the strength of the data and the sources that we have between Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen and also has been further strengthen our key partners, especially Express Scripts but also an institutional pharmacy partner like PharMerica. So we feel like it\u2019s really well positioned. When we \u2013 we are painfully aware of generic deflation and brand inflation and the growth of specialty. So when you look at the $160 billion in revenues and the planned profits, the contemplation of a lower contribution from WBAD is definitely something we thought about in our fiscal year 2019 planning. And we\u2019ll continue to think about it.","So the sourcing component is very important. We think the models will be very successful, of course, other sort of copyright. But the original stakeholders that we have in the \u2013 the original stakeholders that we have are very powerful, informed stakeholders and good partners to have. So I hope \u2013 I\u2019m getting that the time is actually out. So I\u2019ll turn that to Bennett.","Bennett Murphy","And that\u2019s the last question we have time for. But I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim for some closing remarks.","Jim Cleary","Yes. I\u2019ll just take a moment here and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for closing remarks. But I\u2019m going to go off-script just a bit and recognize Steve for just having celebrated his 25th year milestone as an AmerisourceBergen associate. And congratulations, Steve, and thanks for your leadership and for your 25 years of service to all AmerisourceBergen stakeholders.","Steve Collis","Thank you, Jim. I hope that someday, people will think of me as a senior spokesperson, but I\u2019m not ready for that yet. But honestly, as I sit here today, we had a fabulous quarter. We\u2019re proud of the results we had. But if I think about the requirements to do what AmerisourceBergen does, I\u2019m more confident than ever in our value proposition. And the services that we provide continue to grow in scale, in quality, in magnitude. And that\u2019s really both upstream and downstream. And I feel that they are critical to health and outcomes and management of our key customers, whether they\u2019re in the pharmaceutical space, but also to facilitate patient access to care.","So you mentioned 25 years, Jim, but really since our merger in 2001, if you look at the company that we\u2019ve built, the key cultural aspects of people, the relationships that we\u2019ve built, the differentiated services and solutions portfolio, the businesses that we\u2019ve acquired and the strong financial flexibility we have, probably the most financial flexibility we\u2019ve ever had in our future, I just feel very confident that we can successfully navigate the complexity of the U.S. health care system and deliver long-term shareholder value. So thank you for listening. I thought the quality of the questions today was excellent from our sell-side community. I appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's September quarter and fiscal year 2015 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen.

Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. We've actually changed locations within our headquarters here so the train should not be very prominent today and I'm sure you'll all appreciate that. I am just tremendously proud of the results that we are presenting today and I commend our highly engaged associates for the outstanding financial and operational performance we achieved this year. Our success is being driven by the approach we take to the market today. We constantly seek to examine our industry with fresh eyes. We've already taken steps necessary to avail ourselves with the opportunities that we see unfolding and we work collaboratively and creatively to address challenges we see in front of us and our partners in the pharmaceutical supply channel.","The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape healthcare delivery by providing innovative solutions for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers. Our results are a testament to the precision and proficiency with which we run our business and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders.","In financial terms, we exceeded all of our expectations for fiscal year 2015. Our revenues for the full year were up 14% to $136 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continued operations were up 25% to $4.96. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong this year, coming in at a record $3.7 billion. The strength of our financial position enabled us to make important strategic investments including the acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply and most recently the pending acquisition of PharMEDium.","The addition of these two high quality assets to the AmerisourceBergen portfolio demonstrates our commitment to the pharmaceutical supply channel and the opportunities we see inherent in us. It also highlights our ability to extend our existing capability into new markets and to continuously enhance the services we are able to provide to our existing customers. We could not have made these two significant investments in the same calendar year if we did not have tremendous confidence in our ability to manage complex diverse businesses that enhance the level of range and services that we provide to the market.","Moreover, in addition to making these investments, we have also made substantial progress in offsetting the expected impact of warrant exercises we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. At this stage, we've essentially completely offset the impact of the warrants and I'm very proud that we have so adroitly been able to fulfill the commit which we made to our shareholders when we first entered into the long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This relationship, which will be coming up to our three-year anniversary, has thus far been a tremendous success and we look forward to many more benefits in the years ahead. We selected WBA as our long-term partner, not only for cultural fit, but also because we believed they were the best long-term partner for us in the retail chain space. And certainly their performance as our largest customer and sourcing partner has been a very significant contributor to our performance over the last few years.","Our operational execution was also very strong this year. All our customers have benefited from enhancements we have made to our infrastructure, and we have certainly been realizing the benefits of the increasing scale of our business where we have more than doubled the number of lines we manage over the last 25 months. We also continue to execute on our advanced programs and services from manufacturer customers including those that are provided by AmerisourceBergen Switzerland.","While we have substantially strengthened our core business over the last two years, we always feel like we can and should do better. Our customers are being challenged and they want and should expect that we will step up in new innovative ways as well. This is what excites and motivates our team. We also continue to work on the associate experience part of our business and I feel we are not only attracting, and importantly, retaining exceptional talent, but we are being recognized for our culture in the marketplace. Just this week we were named one of the coolest places to work in Philadelphia by Philadelphia Magazine. Not that you can put this in our EPS guidance, but it's still recognition that we are proud of.","For many, many years, wholesalers have proven to be one of the most resilient and reliable components of the pharmacy core channel. Over the last few years our entire industry has successfully transformed itself in order to better address the changing and consolidating needs of the healthcare landscape. Wholesalers have proven to be adept at providing value that goes well beyond the essential services of aggregating demand and the logistics of getting products from one point to another safely and securely. We help enable efficient pharmaceutical care and the widest possible access to products, which allows our customers to focus on expertly caring for their patients.","It remains an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are solid. Health reform initiatives continue to improve access to care and new and innovative products are coming to market. In recent years, we have seen new products come to market that dramatically improve the lives of patients and often in cost-effective ways. The R&D pipeline remains full of promising new products. And the combination of advanced therapies and improving access to care not only drives growth opportunities, but, most importantly, meaningfully improve patients' lives.","The high percentage of generic scripts in the market will help pharmaceutical care be an even greater driver of efficient healthcare for many of the therapies that we deliver. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapies across all sites of care.","Let's turn now to the performance of the AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. Tim will provide the financial details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter, with revenues up 8%, even as we continued to fully anniversary the onboarding of the Walgreens business. Our growth was driven in large part by solid organic volume growth.","While generic drag inflation has slowed meaningfully over the course of the year, generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments. We are very pleased that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy chain, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter.","Last quarter, I spoke about enhancements we have made to our programs through our independent pharmacy customers. The opportunities that exist for ABC to partner with pharmacists to impact the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. will be an important contributor to our growth going forward. For many years we have been proud advocates for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important patch points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care.","We also remain very active with regulators and legislators both independently and through our trade associations to expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers, especially with respect to issues regarding the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply channel.","With the close of the September quarter, we have now fully anniversaried the onboarding of the Walgreens distribution business. Since the implementation of this historic distribution contract, Walgreens has exceeded our internal growth estimate as a customer this quarter, this year and last year. As our retail business has grown substantially over the last two fiscal years, we've also had strong performance in our health systems and alternate site segments.","In early October, we were very pleased to announce the definitive agreement to acquire PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. This acquisition represents an important investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to our health system customers, a customer segment that is playing an increasingly important role in the provision of healthcare in the U.S.","PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality ESPs in key therapeutic areas combined with their impressive track record of growth made them a compelling addition to ABDC. Because we expect PharMEDium to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and we expect the transaction to close during the first quarter, we have included the anticipated contribution from PharMEDium in the guidance we are giving for fiscal 2016 today.","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturing imposed changes on certain oncology products, which moved some revenue from Drug Company to specialty, ABSG revenues were up an impressive 15%. Our physician distribution businesses, ASD and our community oncology business all performed very well in the quarter.","We continue to be very confident and proud of our specialty franchise. Our market leadership in this area is rooted in customer intimacy and deep experience. This informed knowledge has been the inspiration for the investments we have made in this business and the portfolio of service we have developed over many years. Our capabilities extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for specific disease states and unique classes of products.","The combination of services and expertise we offer helps both manufacturers and healthcare providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. I believe the true differentiator of our specialty business is our collaborative approach to bringing innovative solutions to both our physician and manufacturer customers. Working in concert with our business partners is the best way to both discover and deliver value in the long run, especially in a marketplace that is increasingly focused on the cost of care.","During the year our GSMR, global supply and manufacturer relations (sic) [Global Sourcing & Manufacturer Relations,] (14:49) business unit, based principally out of Berne, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, has made important inroads on the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of professionalism and coordination between suppliers and our customers. This also includes an almost 24\/7 communication rhythm with our partners at WBAD.","Let's turn now to the other segments. We had a full quarter of MWI in our results and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration. We have met with most of the large animal health manufacturers and made good progress on identification of synergies. One area where we see a lot of opportunity is in sharing and enhancing technology, not just in our warehouses and distribution centers, but also in the systems and proven methodologies with which we interact with customers and suppliers.","We have made a few tuck-in acquisitions in this area, specifically over the last several months. And while they are small relative to the size of our total business, they are very important to the future of the animal health platform. The companion animal business was especially strong in the September quarter, with growth in the low teens. I have to say that with just seven completed months under our belt, we are delighted by how the MWI integration into ABC has gone.","Moreover, we feel very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016 and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we add this complex new segment to our business. MWI's willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their ongoing commitment to outstanding execution and customer service gives us great confidence in the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC.","Our manufacturer services business also had a solid September quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators today. Our increasingly global reach in our manufacture services and clinical trial logistics business further expands our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products launched in most of the developed world.","As I've said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. Better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, successful launches of new brand products and population demographics drive organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Advances in veterinary medicine improve the quality of life of companion animals and give pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition, increasing global demand for protein drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has garnered in the U.S. into the developing global markets.","As we look ahead to fiscal 2016 and, as I mentioned last quarter, there are a few headwinds and tailwinds that we ask you to bear in mind as you think about our growth rate for next year. Tim will cover the specifics of our expectations, but I want to highlight a few areas. First the tailwinds. Continued solid organic revenue growth driven primarily by customer and product mix, better generic launch outlooks and five months incremental benefit from MWI.","The headwinds are significant impact from DOD contract repricing in the first half of this recently past fiscal year. Other customer contract renewals anticipated in fiscal 2016, notably Casa, whose contract expires late in the fiscal year and, as we have shared before, that contract will be about seven years from when we first entered into this generation of the contract. Third, declining dollar contribution from generic inflation; no one-time benefits from some of the cash flow drivers we experienced in fiscal year 2015.","There are a few additional assumptions to contemplate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no valuation from warrant exercises because we have the 2016 warrant 100% hedged. $0.22 to $0.26 of net contribution from PharMEDium and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain confident that biosimilars are an exciting opportunity for ABC.","As discussed before, we believe we will have a particularly strong role, especially in the physician-administered biosimilar products. The challenges remain on the legal and regulatory side, which prevent us from being too bullish on what biosimilars could contribute to ABC in the short to medium term.","Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to take a moment to thank our associates for delivering excellent performance in fiscal 2015. Our value creation is a result of flawless execution, creative thinking, and the courage to implement bold, new ideas. And our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is booked. They share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being part \u2013 and being an expanding and dynamic channel partner with a view to the future will be what sets ABC apart.","The always-improving quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, and our thoughtful capital management all help us grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value for our manufacturer and healthcare provider customers, our shareholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Steve mentioned, we completed another excellent year at ABC. Let me spend a minute to quickly recap a few highlights. Our drug company executed extremely well this year, it finished the fiscal year setting internal records for both product service levels and order accuracy for all of its customers. Our Specialty Group continues to grow and execute as well. They had their best revenue growth year in the last eight years, with all the businesses in the portfolio contributing. We added MWI and are in the process of closing PharMEDium; both are respected leaders with high market shares, and both have excellent long-term business prospects.","Finally we exit the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet, while virtually eliminating the expected impact of the dilution from the future exercise of the Walgreens warrant.","I have four main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. The third topic, I will briefly cover warrant hedging progress to date. And the fourth and final topic, I will wrap up covering our fiscal 2016 expectations.","So, let's begin our Q4 review. The financial results that I provide this morning will all be on an adjusted basis, unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Also, please note that all financial comparisons are for the fourth quarter ended September 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted.","For Q4 2015, our revenues increased roughly $4 billion to $35.5 billion, up an outstanding 12%. Our growth, on a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, was just under 10%. The quarter's gross profit increased $135 million, 15%, to about $1.1 billion. Almost all of the dollar growth came from our Other segment, primarily as a result of adding MWI. Our pharmaceutical segment was challenged this quarter with a tough comparison, which we anticipated and called out previously, the repricing of the Department of Defense contract and the specialty strong contribution from generic price appreciation back in the September 2014 quarter.","Operating expenses, our total OpEx increased about $103 million, or 20%, to $606 million, consistent with a change in gross profit dollars that I just covered. The Other segment drove virtually all of the dollar growth, again, due to the acquisition of MWI. Operating income was $456 million, up $32 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down about five basis points, driven by the pharmaceutical distribution segment being down 11 basis points this quarter.","Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $27 million. 40% of this expense, or all of the increase, is related to our MWI acquisition financing. Income taxes \u2013 our tax rate was 37% for the current quarter, down some from the prior year. I should highlight that our tax expense and associated tax rate are higher this quarter because of a one-time $10 million reserve of a deferred tax asset, originating from state net operating losses that we will not likely be able to utilize. This negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.04. For the quarter our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $1.17, driven primarily by the addition of MWI. Our adjusted diluted share count was 230 million shares, essentially flat to last year.","Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $34 billion, up 9.5%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company had solid revenue growth up of 8%, driven by two items. The first item, we benefited by solid volume growth and to a lesser extent, a strong brand pricing environment. And the second item, we benefited from the final ramp of the Walgreens business. This key customer accounted for about 60% of the increase in revenue dollars. Beginning in Q1 2016, we anniversaried a full ramp of the Walgreens business and we look forward to growing with this customer in the years ahead.","Our Specialty Business Group had an overall revenue increase of about 24%, similar to the last three quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our Drug Company to our Specialty Business. Our Specialty Business grew an impressive 15% from higher volumes, a continued good pricing environment, and new drug introductions. Specialty's growth came primarily from sales in oncology and ophthalmology drugs. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and Specialty are before intra-segment elimination, consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in the past.","Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $794 million, essentially flat. We saw solid gross profit growth in our Specialty Business due to their higher revenue growth. Our Drug Company, even with strong revenue growth and a solid contribution from generic Abilify, was still behind last year's gross profit, due to the two sizeable headwinds that I called out previously. Importantly, let me highlight that these two headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the segment in our first quarter 2016. So, as you think about our quarterly progression, please remember that these will carry over into the first quarter. The segment's gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points, primarily because of these two items.","Operating expenses were slightly over $400 million and were flat year-over-year. Adjusted segment operating income was $388 million and, again, essentially flat. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug Company.","We can now move to our Other segment, which includes consulting services, World Courier and MWI. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up significantly due to the addition of MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, segment revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the low-teens. MWI continues to have solid revenue performance as a result of their Companion animal business. Excluding the Idec (28:03) impact, Companion would have had a growth rate as a percentage in the low teens. From an operating income standpoint, we had a significant increase, about $30 million, to a total operating income of $68 million.","The segment benefited mostly from having MWI included in the quarterly results, but our consulting business also made a very good contribution this quarter. MWI did incur a one-time bad debt expense of about $4 million in the quarter, related to a U.K. customer that negatively impacted their results. For those that have followed MWI in the past, you know it's highly unusual for the business to have a bad debt at this dollar level.","Let me switch gears and cover a large GAAP item that occurred in the quarter. We determined that we have a permanent write-down of $31 million in our equity investment in ProPharma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler. That write-down is due to the significant decline of ProPharma's stock price from our initial investment date to the date of our impairment testing. We concluded that the decline of the stock price is other than temporary, since the stock price declined significantly over one year ago and has not recovered since. Let me point out our investment in the specialty joint venture where we are 50-50 owners with ProPharma continues to ramp and is tracking to forecast. Because of this, there is no impairment of our specialty joint venture assets. This completes our review of the September quarter.","I'd like to now cover just a few key fiscal 2015 financial metrics. Overall, as Steve mentioned, we did very well meeting or exceeding our increased guidance targets. Revenue on a full-year basis, our growth was nearly 14%. Excluding the impact from MWI for approximately seven months, our revenue growth would have been 12%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented roughly 30% of our total ABC revenues in fiscal 2015 and finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our Specialty Business finished the year at $24.4 billion with revenue growth of about 24%, both are records. Again, excluding the impact of the oncology drug revenue that shifted, ABSG's revenues on a comparable year-over-year basis was an impressive 15%.","Our adjusted operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.40%, an increase of 10 basis points. MWI, a higher margin business, drove about half of our 10 basis-point improvement. EPS, our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.96, up 25%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefits from a lower consolidated tax rate.","Cash flow. We are extremely pleased, completing the fiscal year with free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We had a positive impact from higher total generic revenues, up more than 30% full-year 2015 versus full-year 2014, aided by the onetime ramp of Walgreens generics business. With better working capital metrics, this significant increase in generic volume was an important driver of our extraordinary cash flow this year. Let me also point out that we did have timing differences, which had a positive impact of about $550 million to our free cash flow.","Duplicate inventory of $150 million, that was a negative in fiscal 2014, reversed and helped us in early fiscal 2015. We also had about $400 million of timing here recently in September. With four business days before Labor Day we were able to order and receive some brand inventory, sell through and collect most of the AR by September 30 while the AP wasn't due until October. This pulled a working capital benefit forward from fiscal 2016. That's all I have for comments covering our full-year 2015.","Next I will recap our warrant hedging progress. As Steve highlighted, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise, meaning we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count with the warrant that's exercised by Walgreens most likely in March 2016.","This quarter we also made significant progress against the 2017 warrant. We now believe we are 94% covered based on the September 30 ABC share price. This means the uncovered portion, the 6%, translates to about 1.4 million share shortfall at September 30, 2015. As a reminder, the PharMEDium acquisition will help cover through its income growth any remaining EPS dilution from the anticipated share shortfall once the 2017 warrant is exercised. I'd ask people to refer to the new table we added in our press release that highlights our caps call option coverage at various ABC share prices, which you should find helpful.","Now let's turn to our fiscal 2016 expectations. The guidance that I provide will include our planned PharMEDium acquisition. Our working assumption is that we will report the business in our fiscal 2016 results for about 10 months. Revenues, we expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range. Let me provide some overarching comments about revenue growth. Approximately 1% of our expected consolidated revenue growth will be due to having MWI for an incremental five months in fiscal 2016. PharMEDium will add less than one-half of one percent to our consolidated revenue growth. And as a reminder, this business will become part of ABDC and will be included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","In terms of segments, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution to grow revenues in the high-single digits. Within this segment, our Specialty Business is expected to grow as a percentage in the low teens. We expect our Other segment revenues to grow about 30%, which is aided by having MWI for the full fiscal year.","Gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but here are a few key assumptions. Generic price inflation, consistent with what we communicated in the past, we expect to see some moderation in the dollar contribution amount in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Consequently, this represents a headwind for us, especially in quarter one. Brand drug inflation, we expect to see some moderation in the inflation rate. Generic drug launches, we expect a better year in terms of dollar contribution. Contract renewals, as we have previously stated, ABDC will have a headwind for the first two quarters from the Department of Defense renewal and in the last quarter we will have the impact from the Kaiser contract, which we are working hard to renew.","Next, operating expenses. We expect a fairly high percentage growth rate in this area due to adding the incremental five months of MWI and, to a lesser degree, PharMEDium. About 60% of the consolidated expense increase will be related to these two new businesses. A portion of the remaining increase is related to additional IT and DC infrastructure costs related to our large CapEx project. Examples of the costs include duplicate costs to run parallel IT systems, additional labor and startup costs that can't be capitalized.","Operating income. We expect operating income dollars to grow between 16% and 18%, driven primarily by ABDC and the addition of PharMEDium. Also, we had the benefit of having MWI for the complete fiscal year.","Switching to operating margin. We expect our margin and basis points to be up 8 basis points to 12 basis points, due primarily to the addition of higher margin businesses. Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to increase significantly, 35% to 40%, due to having a full year of financing relating to MWI and the new financing for PharMEDium. Tax rate. Our guidance is to the full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 35.5%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.","Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes that our adjusted share count will increase by about 1% in fiscal 2016. This is due to curtailing our regular share repurchases until we make progress on our credit metrics, getting them back to target levels. As we make progress against our obligations during the year, we will be thoughtful, as always, with our capital deployment.","Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.90, an increase of 15% to 19% over our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS of $4.96. This range includes the benefit of the PharMEDium acquisition that we've highlighted previously, a net contribution of $0.22 to $0.26 for ABC.","Relative to the two large headwinds I've called out previously, the DOD contract renewal and moderation in generic price appreciation, it's important, again, to cover our expected EPS quarterly progression. We expect Q1 to have growth in the mid to high-single digit range. By the time we get to Q4, we expect EPS growth to be in the low 20% range.","Switching to our cash flow. CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. Given our cash outlook, we believe this is the right time to invest in our core drug business and specifically our distribution center network. We plan to spend about 25% of our CapEx to build one new distribution center and also replace or upgrade four existing DCs. We also expect to spend an incremental $100 million on IT infrastructure projects, including two large multi-year projects, a data center consolidation and a new business operating system for our consulting business.","Free cash flow. We expect to return to a more normalized free cash flow this fiscal year as we anniversary the benefit of the significant increase in our generics business. Consequently, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion.","In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering several topics, including guidance, so thank you for your attention. Like Steve, I'd like to personally thank all the ABC associates for the efforts made this year delivering these outstanding financial results. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year and we believe the company continues on the right course to deliver long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in ABC.","Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many callers as possible. Colin, please go ahead with Q-and-A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment, please. And first we'll go to the line of Bob Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Steve, did you say \"the coolest company in Philadelphia\"? Is that like an air conditioning reference? I'm not sure I'm seeing that otherwise.","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah, we've had a lot of cracks about it, but I told my predecessors it's not your grandfather's AmerisourceBergen. But I think it's just we had focused a lot on the social experience. We've done a lot of great things for our associates, including having open area working, bar graphs, different sort of development opportunities, which they appreciate. I mean, these are actually some of the things that MWI has appreciated about joining ABC is a lot of the development programs we have.","And, yeah, I think the culture is something that truly is setting up more and more apart with enthusiasm and passion people have for the business. For example, I was at our World Courier office in London on Monday, I'll tell you it's very infectious, the passion that group has. Essentially it's the same people that were there when we acquired the company and that was a long time \u2013 I believe it was actually just a little bit after we completed the acquisition. But the same is true wherever we go.","I was in Ireland with our BluePoint folks Friday. So, just \u2013 but more importantly, from a scale perspective the U.S. business is also very true of that whether it's Frisco, the Specialty Group, Charlotte, the consulting services, and Philadelphia, and all our Drug Company regions. So, I mean I'm just pointing out that our culture is really a strong driver of our performance and the confidence that Tim and I have that we can pull off two very complex deals like this. And we \u2013 $5 billion in acquisitions in one year is definitely a sign that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Well, I'd say you're not paying Larry Marsh enough. But I guess, as my follow-up, can you just give us a quick update on PharMEDium and just some of the FDA issues they have? Where does that stand?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's interesting, because I think if you go back to the pedigree legislation, we were so focused on it and got slightly irked last year \u2013 two years ago that it was being held up by compounding part of (43:09), the drug safety and quality. And now that's turned out to be what we think is probably one of the key drivers for our investment decision here is the quality requirements that are going to come, that are already resident in that business and we think it will only improve. Increase the vigilance that will be required from these pharmacies and the scale is only going to increase. And we were just so impressed with their competitive differentiation and their commitment to quality.","The acquisition idea has been very well received by our health systems customers. We had some \u2013 one of our big customers said \"Did you guys take your bold pills?\" That was one of the comments they gave us back. But we had a quick diligence, yeah, it's not of the overall footprint to say smaller even a smaller acquisition, like World Courier, with four very large compounding pharmacies of which we managed to visit all of them during our diligence. But we're excited and we think that there will be a very iterative dialogue always with the FDA and other regulators, but we expect that we will continue to set the bar for quality in this area.","And we think that the service will be \u2013 it's not a commodity service at all, this a high-quality service, it's complex, and like I said, when we announced this, if my family was being \u2013 getting a sterile IV, I'd like it to come from PharMEDium. I can't believe that a hospital on its own can create the center of excellence that a company like PharMEDium can for these sterile preparations. So, we're expecting to close sometime in the next two to three weeks. We haven't heard back yet from the FCC, but we're well positioned to close and we're excited to bring them on board and we do expect that we will close fairly shortly because Tim wouldn't have included it in guidance if we hadn't had that strong expectation. So, Tim, anything else to add?","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I would just say the other thing, just to remind people for the conference call, I mean, we did a fair amount of diligence, we were aware of all the outstanding items and we're committed to investing and resolving and we think the regulatory to be a competitive moat. If we do it really well, it will protect our market share.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Good morning, Steve and Tim. So I guess, first, right off the bat, given yesterday's announcement, how are you scaled currently to take on a large new retail client across branded and retail? I know that, in Tim's remarks, there was an investment in a new DC. I'm wondering, sort of, if that's sort of related to just potential growth. And just overall what type of investments you need \u2013 you would need to make and how quickly you could get there?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's really early because, obviously, we weren't under the tent. We anticipated that WBA would be a consolidated, that's one of the reasons why we entered into this very comprehensive relationship with them. And so far, that thesis has proved to be very, very intact. And, we were, irrespective of any consolidation, we were expanding our network. Some of our centers definitely have been around 30 years. I remember when I joined Bergen, for example, in 1994, that Houston was the standard, Mansfield. And those are some of the ones that are now older, they were the standard, most modern DCs in our network. So, it's definitely time that we needed to expand the network. But I think it's a good example of us investing in our core business and being ready for new development and new growth. We always had customers that are growing the fastest, many of them. That is something that's always evident in our thinking when we select who we're going to try to retain and who we're going to go after in a competitive RFP type situation.","So \u2013 and then our exposure to specialty is a benefit to us, not only in growth but also in any changes and price increases, because specialty drugs, because of ASD in particular, have a lower exposure to price increases historically than the way that other brand drugs and the (47:44) the top brand drugs and established therapies. Even the self-administered ones wouldn't \u2013 MS and rheumatoid arthritis combo, typically the physician-administered have the lowest exposure to price increases.","So, not a good thing about our business, so we were very well prepared. We've announced four new DCs and one that will be completed this year. And we're looking more like Orlando models for these new larger DCs where we have 300,000 to 400,000 square feet. So, that's pretty impressive and we use the same footprint, it's very efficient, we've retained a lot of the people that worked on the AmerisourceBergen integration. We've retained a very good engineering and distribution science department that continues to \u2013 performing excellently for us. And we've used it to consult with customers on different projects as well. So they're a great resource for us and probably something we don't talk about enough. Tim, anything to add? No?","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","So I guess you guys are very well prepared. But I guess is it sort of in months increments or is it something that will take longer than that to just prep up for?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we \u2013 as far as your initial question on Rite Aid, we point to a very long regulatory \u2013 not \u2013 I mean, I'll just go with what Stefano said yesterday in that we also \u2013 we shouldn't really comment on what the existing distribution obligations are. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to comment.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Got it. And then \u2013 on the Walgreens overall, you've been pretty consistent categorizing the work you've done and the three buckets and the branded and then the generics and then the overarching third other bucket. So, I'm just wondering what are you building into this year from the other bucket that I really haven't heard yet much about. And, of course, given the recent announcements, how does this impact the plans that you have for this year in this other bucket?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the recent announcement would probably be mostly in bucket one and bucket two but, again, that's not current. So bucket three continues to be discussions around specialty, you know, is there a benefit to doing more on the consumer HBA or DC side, some benefits of \u2013 from \u2013 for Good Neighbor Pharmacy from some of the competencies that WBA has well-established. Clinics is one that we pride some models on for example, but also network co-development. So those are the areas. And I think having Ornella on our board, who has been a champion of independent pharmacy in Europe, and having both Stefano and Ornella and a lot of the former Alliance Boots people having more exposure to the U.S. market. But the wonderful heritage that they have in wholesale I think is going to really bode well for us. So we continue to have great discussions about bucket three.","I'll tell you bucket two, which is the sourcing, has been terrific. We still think we're the most global. We have overall still the largest sourcing contracting ability. And I think you've seen Stefano's really strong inclination to grow both organically and through acquisition and Alex having a strong focus on the customer experience in the stores. So, we are very pleased with where we are.","And (51:25) in international specialty, I think there's a lot that we're working on. It's just with the type of size that they are, but even AmerisourceBergen is as well, it's hard for them to show up directly in any of the results from quarter to quarter, but you will see a long trend, I believe, towards more collaboration and joint innovation, co-investments we're looking at in a few markets, et cetera.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Got it. Thank you.","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I would just remind everybody, we said bucket three would be three to five years. We're kind of at that point, we're stilling adding top-to-top meetings and talking to our partners. And they've been busy and we've been busy, but clearly we still have discussions and we think we can do some things commercially together as we go forward.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Thanks.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Garen. Next question, please?","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, thanks for the questions. I guess just a couple questions on the guidance assumptions. So it sounds like you're expecting declining dollar contribution from generic inflation. Just to be clear, you are still assuming an inflationary environment, you're not thinking about deflation next year? And then this seems to be a bit of a moving target, where inflation has been and where it's going. I guess how much visibility do you guys have or do you feel you have around this important driver?","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I guess I'll jump in and start, Bob. We are assuming a positive contribution. We're modeling 2016 after we \u2013 just to give some goalposts here, we're modeling 2016 after the second half of our fiscal year. So our June quarter, September quarter, we've taken that two quarter and period and said that's probably the run rate, so that's how we're thinking about 2016, positive contributions to GP. In terms of inflation-deflation, we have a large portfolio of generics. That basket can still be somewhat deflationary and still provide positive contribution to your P&L. We really haven't commented on where we think that portfolio would be, but again, I would assume, as we've been in the past slightly positive with that portfolio, it's going to be slightly negative in 2016.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I guess just on the other side, on the branded inflation assumption, it sounds like you're expecting branded pricing to moderate. That sounds like a little bit of an incremental update. How impactful, I guess, will that be on the outlook? And then is the expectation for some moderation in branded pricing, is that something that you're observing currently in the marketplace and that's why you're baking it into the outlook?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say the highest inflation I can ever remember this year at 15%. So I think there's been a lot of publicity about that. And it's not driven as much by the smaller products that are often used, say, in hospital anesthesia It's some of the bigger products as well, which has been well recorded. And I don't expect that \u2013 we've probably seen more a resumption to the low teens or even high single digits. That's the range that we would see.","Again, ABC, our portfolio's very geared towards specialty, which as I've said a little while ago, because of ASP on the physician side, you don't see the big increases there that you see in other sectors. So we think that pharmaceuticals will still, of course, provide excellent healthcare efficiency and especially when they're administered in the correct settings with the right sort of adherence programs, it's one of the best drivers of value. And I think manufacturers, I think you just have a lot of therapies that provide excellent value and then they look at new therapies being introduced and the efficacy of those drugs and I think there's been a propensity to increase that.","I think the change generally gets overestimated and things take a lot longer than you expect. And a good example I can give you is the pedigree rule. Everyone knew that it had to be made, it had to be passed, it made sense, it was going to cause a lot of inefficiency in the system, so the states started passing down pedigree rules. But it's very, very hard to get legislation passed, as you know. We know this week's events, but notwithstanding that, it always does seem to get very hard to get legislation passed and I would just remember that when you make any assumptions on how things will change, especially from legislation.","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Bob, I would just say, to level-set everybody, remember with brand, we probably have 95% of our brand volumes tied up with fee-for-service agreements and we're probably in the third, fourth evolution of contracts. So again, a change in brand inflation is not a big driver to our P&L. It's a sweetener maybe, but it's not going to impact us.","And I would like to just for 30 seconds go back to generic price appreciation. We talk a lot about it, but just to remind everybody, the bottom line is this generic volume and capturing the wallets and not having the leakage. It's the rebates and incentives you get from your manufacturer partners, it's launches. Those are the things that really drive your P&L more so and what we focus on than something that's not in our control as generic price appreciation. It's, again, an enhancer, but those other categories are really significant to our P&L.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Next question, please?","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. There's always a lot of talk about global procurement in your deal that you put together a couple years ago with Walgreens. But, Steve, we don't generally hear you make announcements about customers that come onto that platform. Can you maybe just give us an update as to where you are on that? And what are some of the offerings that you have in the marketplace for your existing customers?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so I can answer that a few ways, Lisa. Thanks for the question. The best way and the most practical way for an ABC customer to access the WBAD benefits is through our ProGen formulary. We're focused every day on making that the best overall value basket. So it's not really the headline news. But we do these massive business reviews and the first I think on page 8 or 9, we start getting into ProGen volume. And when I get the data, I know it's the first thing I look at, how are we doing in ProGen because it's so important to us and it's a key driver.","And ABC, I think with the SAP implementation and with Bob Mauch coming on as President and his strong analytical background, our analytics get stronger and stronger all the time. And it's very complex because there's 2,000 important generic products. And a lot of our customers are in the market and outside of our usual peers there's also some other companies that get into generic telemarketing and some of those are even operated by our peer companies. So, it's a very dynamic marketplace and we focus every day on making sure our customers understand it.","Recently I've been really impressed with some of the dashboard tools that we have so that our sales reps can do incredible deals, have great access to very powerful and up-to-date tools to show customers exactly what their true net pricing is, taking into account full rebates, et cetera. So we're doing a good job. I think we'll carry on getting even better.","Again, they Alliance Boots heritage, I think people really understand how we need to compete against short-run wholesalers, et cetera. So there's a lot of strong commonality we have. And then Peyton's group being based in Berne I think is also very helpful. So that might be one way that I'd answer question.","Just quickly, I know because we're coming close to \u2013 we're actually over our time. GNP with Dave Neu is being fully focused on that. We've announced we had our strongest new level of service offering, we call it the next generation of services, and a lot of that is around adherence, a lot of it is around new network programs, a lot of that is really encouraging the highest level of compliance from our customers. So that's all going well. We had over 800 customers sign up the first month to go on our Elevate platform and we'll give you further updates on that. We just had a lot to talk about on this call, but we're very bullish about where it's going.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there a way, though, with that 800 customers, can you talk about how that's grown over time or what that compares to the total number of customers that you have, so we can just get an idea, Steve, of the incremental opportunities around this?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we will do that on the next call. The 800 was just the people who immediately signed up to switch from our GNP Provider Network to Elevate just literally in the first couple of days. And that was just based on the strong trade show we had in Las Vegas. But we will, Barbara, give you an update on that because we are very excited about the GNP platform and how it's proceeding and we want to make sure that we stay in the leadership position. We did win the J.D. Powers brand satisfaction survey this year again, so we note that and we're very pleased about that.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Operator, I think we'll take one more question.","Operator","Yes, and that will be from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So, a question on revenue and margin and as you do your forward plan for this year I imagine you're also thinking through (61:37 \u2013 61:44).","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Eric? Operator, can you hear me?","Operator","Can...","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you hear me?","Operator","Yes, Mr. Percher. Please continue.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Were you able to hear the first part?","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","I can hear you now. But why don't you start over, Eric?","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So a question on revenue and margin. And looking at 8% to 10% growth, less, of course, the little bit of acquisition. These are high numbers relative to recent history. It sounds like you're taking a prudent amount of brand inflation, perhaps returning to the mean a bit from this high-growth year. As you look at 8% to 10% or maybe it's 6.5% to 8% once you pull in acquisitions, do you think that's the sustainable growth rate going forward?","And then as you look to your margin on the growth that you're getting here, obviously we don't have generic conversion in the same way. In fact, we have generic inflation working against us. How do you think about the margin profile and your ability to drive margins, understanding that you have a couple of factors working against you this year?","Tim G. Guttman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Eric. This is Tim, I'll start. We have a very strong portfolio of businesses, customers, I should say. And they're large and they're fast growers, so we think we're advantaged that way, to grow faster than the market. I think we've proven that the last few years. That's why we \u2013 we do have inflation baked in there. We do sell a large mix of brand drugs, but at the end of the day, large customers like a Walgreens and like a Kaiser and others, the GPOs grow faster and that helps us. And let's not forget we also have Specialty, a strong franchise that we called out should grow in the low teens for 2016.","So we're pretty optimistic about our topline revenue growth. In terms of margin, margins will be flattish. Again, I called out that we're going to be up 10 basis points in 2016 with most of that coming from the new businesses. So that's MWI and PharMEDium. We're really focused on growing operating dollars, I mean, that's what we do. And that's first and foremost. And then sometimes the margin is challenged because of these large customers and the pricing they get. So it puts a little bit of margin pressure on the P&L. But, again, we focus on growing dollars to drive the EPS growth. I don't know, Steve, if you have any comments?","Steven H. Collis - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the last thing we try to do, if you just \u2013 I would love to make this comment, because it's one I'm exceptionally proud of. If you look at \u2013 set aside the $3.7 billion we had in cash flow in fiscal year 2015 and go to the more normalized rate we predicted, but you'll note that it's almost double our EPS growth rate, a little bit less than that. Of course, when you look at it, it's only about six days sales. However, we've done a great job of taking that cash flow, managing through the warrant hedging, which has been significant, over $2 billion of \u2013 about. And then two acquisitions with our strong balance sheet that will differentiate us both in services and margins.","MWI, I think was well understood, but PharMEDium, if you look at their financial performance, it's been absolutely, for a large business, one of the most impressive growth rates I've seen since our early days of Specialty. It's pretty \u2013 their financial performance was what really, really attracted our attention. And our ability that we can continue to carry on driving significant numbers.","So if you look at the job ABC's doing, we're investing in our core businesses with differentiated complex, higher margin services. And that cash flow is what gives us the ability to do it. And we've always said our first prize is great internal projects. So, for example, when I was at Heathrow this week, there's a $300,000 testing machine that they're going to buy, which will save us $300,000 in testing expenses. Not anything we'd normally talk about, but that's a great example of why internal investments work the best for us. Our national (65:52) center has been an absolute home run, particularly now as we bring it into fiscal year 2016. SAP, it cost us a lot more than we expected, but we couldn't have done the things we're doing without it. That's prize number one.","Prize number two is World Courier, PharMEDium, and MWI. And PharMEDium is still too early to call, but MWI, I think, and in World Courier we feel terrific about the way we've been able to bring in the people, the customers, the suppliers. So I think we're doing the job that you're all paying us to do very, very well. And I just wouldn't look \u2013 underestimate the importance of that cash flow and how it's \u2013 how it's fitting into our ability to carry on managing our margins, our growth rates, and invest both in internal and external projects. So I just \u2013 I did want to make that point as we wrapped up.","So thanks, Eric; and Barb, I'll just conclude by saying how proud we are of our performance this year. It really has been a great couple of years. We're excited about developments in the marketplace. No one can accuse our sector of being boring at all. And this is an incredibly dynamic time to be in this industry. And I'm just very proud of the way ABC's positioned \u2013 the way we're approaching customers, the way we're approaching associates. Actually the relationship I have with our board, I should say, is another great element in our success. So, hopefully this call will demonstrate both the value we're providing as well as the confidence we have in the future. Thanks for your time today.","Barb, are you going to close?","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations","Yes, thanks, Steve. And for those who are still on the line, I know we left a lot of people in the queue, so we'll try and get to you as soon as we can. But before we sign off, I just want to highlight that we'll be at a couple of upcoming investor events. On November 4 we will be attending the Citi Healthcare Conference in New York. On December 10 we'll be attending the Bank of America Chicago Healthcare One-on-One Conference and in January we'll be attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. With that I'll turn it back to the operator.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this morning's conference call will be available for replay and that will be after \u2013 give me one moment, please, I do apologize \u2013 after 1:00 p.m. today through November 5, 2015, ending at midnight.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's June quarter fiscal year 2016 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen. And joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO of AmerisourceBergen, and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO of AmerisourceBergen.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations, including without limitation revenue, operating margin and taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstance. We remind you there are many uncertainties and risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

We have a lot of material to cover this morning, so we will get started and we'll leave ample time for questions, but we'll try to keep the call to an hour. Now here is Steve Collis.","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on this very busy day. I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May. Revenues were up nearly 8% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. Certain areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our specialty group also continued its strong performance in the June quarter.","At AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, we renewed our distribution relationship with Kaiser Permanente for five years and achieved the benefit of some expense reduction earlier than expected. With many of our large customer renewals now behind us, we feel really good about our market position in all of our key portfolio segments.","While there's still work to be done, I'm thrilled to commend our associates for their successful work and dedication in ensuring that we are well positioned as we approach the end of the fiscal year, and look ahead towards next year. As I have said many times, we are fortunate to play a key role in a vibrant industry, and to have a strong hold in the U.S. market, which is still the best market in the world.","U.S. organic sales growth continues to be strong, and the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry dynamics remain competitive but stable. In addition, we take great pride in our ability to increasingly meet the needs of our pharmaceutical manufacture partners on a global scale, and to use our extensive knowledge, reach, and partnership philosophy to help our healthcare provider customers better serve their patients.","Turning now to our performance in the quarter, Tim will provide the details, but I want to highlight some key items. I've just returned from ThoughtSpot, our annual retail trade show in Las Vegas, where we hosted a record number of independent community pharmacy attendees. I was excited to see firsthand the enthusiasm with which our independent customers are embracing our new offerings.","In Las Vegas, we renewed our long-standing commitment to community pharmacy, and we highlighted several resources we have been investing in to ensure our GNP stores remain successful. Our government advocacy resources include a new internet site called OurIndependentVoice.com, which provides pharmacists with a centralized place to access tools to join advocacy movement and stay abreast of community and legislative developments.","Our Front-End Retail Excellence programs helps our members optimize front-end sales, take advantage of manufactured promotions and make better use of point of sale data and reporting tools. We have also introduced ABC Order, our next generation ordering platform that is specifically engineered to fit within pharmacy workflow, and will be available in 2017.","While community providers certainly face challenges in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacies. The future is in value-based and patient-centered care, which is exactly the type of care that our independent pharmacy customers excel at providing. The future will also demand a seamless integration of technology and personalized service and our latest offerings in these areas will enable our independent customers to be on the forefront of this evolution in pharmacy care.","We have deployed new offerings that streamline pharmacy operations and reimbursement activities. In addition, we are providing innovative tools that simultaneously enrich the patient experience, while improving the pharmacy's efficiency.","Finally, we stand besides all our customers and the patients they serve as we advocate on their behalf with state and federal legislators and regulators. Our primary work in Washington is to ensure that our customers receive a fair share of the healthcare dollar amidst increasing pressure on costs from all payer segments and an increasingly transparent and demanding environment. In a tumultuous political environment, it is very important to remain engaged to ensure adequate reimbursement and to preserve patient access to care.","Before I move on, I want to take a moment to recognize a great colleague, and to thank Dave Neu as he retires from AmerisourceBergen after 34 years of extraordinary service to the company and our retail pharmacy customers. Dave started his career as a truck driver, and rose through the ranks to become the head of our drug company before ending his career as the President of Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Dave's vision and customer-centric philosophy helped make ABC a true leader, and his dedication to excellence and to mentoring the next generation of leaders will be sorely missed.","We are excited that Brian Nightengale has ably stepped into the leading role in our retail sales operations and Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Brian is a pharmacist, and came to ABC as the cofounder of Xcenda, one of our market-leading consulting businesses. Like so many of our leaders, Brian elected to stay with the company after the acquisition of Xcenda, because he believed in the vision and the people of ABC.","As a business founder, he brings an entrepreneurial spirit to GNP, as well as deep experience in specialty, manufactured services and value-based care. I am very excited about Brian's unique fit for this role, and it was awesome to see him already deeply engage with customers last week at our trade show.","As I mentioned earlier, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Kaiser Permanente for an additional five years. We are very pleased that this premier healthcare system has chosen to remain our partner, and we look forward to continuing our history of innovation focused on the Kaiser Permanente members. During the quarter, we made steady progress in our efforts to evolve our customer's pricing strategies on brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions.","Every conversation we are having with our customers regarding contract and renewals addresses this challenge, and we are pleased that our customers are not only receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products, but are open to finding workable solutions. ABDC will continue to face occasional headwinds as we renew customers in the ordinary course of time, but we are pleased that so many key customers are signed on to long-term contracts.","PharMEDium, which, of course, is now part of ABDC, had a great quarter. The integration of PharMEDium has been seamless and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our hospital customers have proven to be receptive to the products and services that PharMEDium provides, and the scale and quality of their compounded, sterile preparations is a primary driver in their ability to earn new business. Bob Mauch and I visited PharMEDium a few weeks ago, and I'm really pleased about the quality-based innovative approach they are taking to ensure ever higher standards of efficiency and safety while working in a demanding regulatory environment. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, and I am very excited about the future potential of this business.","As I conclude my comments on our drug company, I want to say a few words about drug pricing. Drug pricing trends in the quarter on both branded and generic products were in line with our expectations, though some of the brand increases came earlier than expected. Generic deflation in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. Intense focus on the cost of both traditional and specialty pharmaceutical care will persist for some time and will come from different venues, but in the efforts to manage the expense of healthcare, we must not sacrifice patient access to care. AmerisourceBergen is increasingly the partner of choice for manufacturers and healthcare providers alike, who are working to demonstrate the immense value inherent in medication therapies and the life-changing impacts they have on patients and their health outcomes. Our ability to work collaboratively across the entire healthcare spectrum to preserve patient access enables us to be a trusted partner in a rapidly changing marketplace.","AmerisourceBergen's specialty group, which has long championed patient access to specialty products, once again had a strong quarter with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. As I explained last quarter, the economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits, and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by a physician that is treating a patient in a community setting, because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. As we have discussed before, our unique position in specialty sets us up well to be a future leader in biosimilars. While we haven't seen many launches yet, we are pleased to see some promising developments around FDA panel approvals of biosimilars.","The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a valuable partner in nearly every aspect of bringing the product to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early lifecycle activities and the development of the market for biosimilars. Taken individually, our specialty group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma, vaccine and physician office distribution businesses, or our third-party logistics business. Taken together, the specialty group is the undisputed leader enabling specialty product success and is the essential partner for manufacturers or providers and ultimately for the patients they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as biosimilars come to market and personalized medicine becomes more prevalent, because all of these innovations will take place in an environment that is laser focused on value and cost efficiency.","In addition, just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians who are caring for some of the sickest patients. I have been working with community physicians for more than 20 years, and I have always been inspired by the way they care for their patients. The costs to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risk associated with disruptions in care can be life threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and maintenance on some Part D drugs, and will do so in a way that keeps patient welfare paramount.","Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs, and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. The increasingly global reach we have established in this area also further expands our value propositions to manufacturers, especially in Canada, Western Europe, and Brazil.","Our best in class consulting services within that group performed well in the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will unlock new possibilities for growth by driving internal efficiencies and expanding our capability to provide custom-tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers. Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials.","World Courier recently launched Cocoon, a new transport service that utilizes innovative packaging for temperature sensitive materials. Cocoon offers a powerful combination of lower weight and proven higher performance that eliminates the need to sacrifice quality for cost. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.","Turning now to MWI. I'm especially pleased with the strong results they continue to deliver. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business, via organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI's private-label generics program, (17:28) is also growing above market as it adds additional products to its portfolio and is achieving increased penetration. We continue to discover ways in which MWI enhances ABC, and the addition of MWI has added a new perspective and dimension to our pharmaceutical manufacturer relationships. We have learned a lot from one another, especially in sourcing and supply chain activities where the best practices on both the human and animal health side of the business are even more complementary than we first envisioned.","The MWI team has also been working closely with ABDC's warehouse management experts to identify areas where we can draw scale efficiencies and implement best practices. These collaborative efforts have been very successful and I applaud our teams for being open to innovation on both sides. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It is an area which we will continue to invest in, as we have only just begun to realize the full set of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.","Looking ahead, as we noted in the press release, we now expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, an increase of 11% to 12% over fiscal year 2015. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year, and to have completed $350 million in share repurchases by fiscal year end. We have also reiterated the preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 that we gave last quarter, which includes adjusted EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6% on revenue growth, in line with the market. Tim will provide additional details on our working assumptions. But keep in mind that we're still in our planning process and will provide our full guidance in early November.","Over the longer term, we would expect to be able to grow revenues slightly above the market, grow gross profits slightly slower than revenues, drive some operating leverage, generate free cash flow at approximately 125% of net income, and benefit from the balanced redeployment of capital, including both strategic and synergistic M&A and share repurchases. Ultimately our aspirational goal is to achieve adjusted EPS growth in the mid-teens.","In summary, and in conclusion, I continue to have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. The strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated assets is a compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our seasoned management team shares my passion and drive for producing excellent results, while also delivering outstanding customer service.","Our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our associates' track record of seamless execution, our financial performance, and our thoughtful capital management, all help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.","Now I will turn it over to Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. I would ask that you refer to our press release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons I make this morning are for the third quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. I have three primary areas to cover this morning. First, I will recap our fiscal Q3 consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our revised fiscal 2016 expectations. And third, I will provide updated commentary on fiscal 2017.","With that we can begin our third quarter review. Revenues were $36.9 billion, up 8%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for almost all of our revenue growth. As a reminder, included in this segment is our PharMEDium acquisition. They accounted for a relatively small part of our overall ABC revenue increase. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for roughly 80% of our gross profit dollar growth, with PharMEDium being a key contributor to this growth.","Operating expenses, our total adjusted OpEx increased 4% to $574 million. Last quarter we mentioned on our call that we are focused on expenses and ensuring we spend in the right areas. We believe we've made good progress in this area in the June quarter. Looking forward to our fourth quarter, please keep in mind, that we typically have a seasonal increase in our operating expenses, primarily around payroll and compensation.","Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $493 million, up $38 million, or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, 1 basis point improvement. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 32.8% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. As highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated a lower tax rate due to the growth in our international businesses. We continue to expect that our full-year tax rate will be roughly 33%. As a reminder, this tax rate is durable, as long as our mix of U.S. to international business stays at its current level.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.37, driven mostly by the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, and to a lesser degree from our lower effective tax rate. Our adjusted diluted share count was just under 229 million shares down about 1% from last year.","Let me highlight that in this quarter, we did have a positive EPS contribution of a few pennies from two items. The first item, we had two earlier than expected brand manufacturer price increases, coming in June versus July, and the second item, we had some expense savings that came faster than anticipated, and exceeded our expectations.","Turning now to our third quarter segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.4 billion, up a very solid 8%. Our drug company had a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth was after a revenue headwind of roughly 1.5%, due to lower Hepatitis C sales. The drug company had solid growth across several customer segments, including Walgreens, which grew at approximately 7%. Additionally, PharMEDium had another quarter of excellent unit volume growth, which drove a very good top-line revenue increase for their business.","ABSG, which is our specialty business had their highest revenue growth rate this year, with revenue increasing about 20%, driven mostly by volume. ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for 5% of specialty's 20% revenue growth, due primarily to a new manufacturer relationship that started late last fiscal year. We also continued to realize meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across a few of our businesses, and to a lesser degree from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business.","Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $794 million, up $49 million, or 7%. The increase in gross profit dollars was split somewhat evenly between the drug company and ABSG. Our drug company's increase was mostly from PharMEDium, which performed better than expected. Segment operating income was $411 million, and was up 9%. The growth was the direct result of higher revenues and the corresponding income contribution, combined with tight expense management. Overall we are pleased with the progress we're making in this segment, and we are especially pleased with the performance of our ABSG specialty business.","We can now move to our other segment, which includes MWI, consulting services, and World Courier. In the June quarter, segment revenues were $1.6 billion up about 3%. The segment had a revenue headwind of a few percentage points from a piece of business that moved from our TheraCom distribution business back to the manufacturer. Growth rates in our core consulting services, World Courier, and MWI businesses were all in line with what we expected. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well with percentage revenue growth in the companion animal segment in the high-single digits. On the production animal side of the business, revenue growth was still a little low, but we are very encouraged based on cattle market trends that growth rates will pick up as we move into late summer and fall.","From an operating income standpoint, the segment had operating income of $83 million, up 7%, driven primarily from MWI, and our World Courier businesses.","Turning next to working capital and cash flow items. In the June quarter, we had modest free cash flow generation when compared to our two previous quarters this fiscal year. The lower cash generation was due to a sizable impact from timing, unfavorable working capital in the June quarter that reversed during the first week of July.","Additionally, free cash flow was also impacted from the extra working capital investment we made with Walgreens. I should remind everyone that this working capital investment will continue to be phased in over the next few quarters. At June 30, we had $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes $470 million offshore, related primarily to our Switzerland and World Courier businesses. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization.","Moving to our revised fiscal 2016 expectations. Before I cover our specific guidance measures, let me just make a few brief comments on the drug pricing environment in addition to what Steve discussed earlier. Starting with generics. Our generic portfolio or basket of generic drugs through July, as expected, deflated in the high-single-digit range. Let me highlight that our deflation rate is calculated using our specific sales mix and inventory levels for our fiscal year.","Others in the supply chain may calculate their indexes differently or likely will have a slightly different deflation rate because of their unique mix of business. While there are several market factors that can impact our forward-looking assumption, based on what we know today we expect that our generic deflation rate will remain where it is currently through the end of our fiscal year September 30.","Switching to branded drugs. The month of July has historically been a period where we tend to see a number of branded drug price increases. This current July was not an exception. The number of increases and the rate of increase were mostly in line with what we expected, except for the two manufacturers that announced their price increases earlier than expected in June.","We can now move to our updated fiscal 2016 P&L guidance, adjusted EPS, as we enter our fourth quarter. As a reminder new pricing for the Kaiser renewal took effect on July 1. Our EPS guidance range is now $5.52 to $5.57, which is growth of 11% to 12% versus last fiscal year. Free cash flow, we still expect to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, and for share repurchases we now expect to repurchase about $350 million for the full year.","The final topic I want to cover this morning is commentary on our fiscal 2017 outlook. Even though we are in the middle of our planning process, we are still comfortable with the preliminary guidance we gave last quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS. We expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2016 guidance range. In our press release that we issued this morning we listed our key assumptions related to our preliminary fiscal 2017 guidance. But there are three specific guidance assumptions I would like to highlight on our call.","Number one, generic pricing. As mentioned earlier, the trends haven't changed from what we previously expected. Our working assumption for fiscal 2017 is that generic deflation remains in the high single-digit range.","Number two, the Medicare Part B demonstration project and the impact to our specialty business. With a lack of clarity on what if anything gets implemented and importantly the timing, it's just too early to estimate the impact to our business.","And number three, the new accounting rules regarding share-based compensation. While it's likely we will early adopt the new accounting rule in our fiscal 2017, our guidance range does not contemplate the impact from an implementation. Most of our share-based compensation is weighted towards stock options. This makes forecasting the tax benefit more challenging because it's difficult to predict when the employee will exercise, and importantly, the ABC share price at the time of exercise. Our current thinking is that the EPS impact will likely be modest.","As I wrap up my comments, overall we are pleased with our results this quarter. As we move into our fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we're gaining traction in our core drug business. Our ABSG specialty business continues to have good momentum, and MWI and PharMEDium, our most recent acquisitions, are performing very well.","As always, we thank you for your interest in ABC. Let me now turn it over to Barbara to start the Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. This morning we'll ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can accommodate as many callers as possible within the hour. Okay, Roxanne, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions, guys. It sounds like you're saying, Tim, if I heard you, and Steve in your prepared correctly, that generic pricing was in line with your assumptions, which was for high-single digits. I think that would imply that you actually did, in fact, see things get sequentially worse from last quarter to this quarter. Just wanted to make sure that that is, in fact, the case.","And maybe if you could dig into that a little bit on maybe where you saw deterioration in pricing, just because I think that observation probably does run a little counter to what we were hearing from both manufacturers and others in the supply chain, at least relative to last quarter.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, hey, Bob, good morning. It's Tim. And I'll start and Steve can jump in. But, yeah, no, we're definitely saying that it's consistent with what we expected. When we talked to investors and did our call last quarter, we communicated that we were in the mid-single-digit range, probably at the top of that range, and certainly sequentially as we moved into this quarter, you know, we bumped up a bit. We're now in that high-single-digit range, so we did move up sequentially. But, again, I want to stress that that's what we expected across our portfolio, and our portfolio is unique to ABC. I still think that \u2013 and Steve can jump in \u2013 that that we can navigate through that deflation and we feel like it's still \u2013 that's just one aspect of how we make money on generics.","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, you know, our deflation trends are \u2013 I think we all measure it a bit differently, but we do it mainly based on purchasing information. And, of course, we always do try retain the GP dollars, but we have long-term relationships with the manufacturers and we've always monitored that. And, of course, we work a lot in concert with (35:30) and we have a very long-term approach to the business. And we are confident, Bob, that whatever the environment, we will continue to do very well in generics. We think our sourcing is excellent, the volume, the trend towards \u2013 so many of the prescriptions are generic, so that's just a great trend for us. There are still going to be significant generic launches next year, and then there are small instances of price inflation in unique circumstances based on usually some manufacturer-based events. So -","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob, I would just make one more comment, if I can. I commented that it went up sequentially, but again, I think it's important that it didn't change our outlook for 2017 and we didn't revise our growth expectations.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim. Next question, please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. My question is really regarding the status of the negotiation with specialty manufacturers. You know, Steve, you talked about that and last quarter I think you kind of like \u2013 you touched upon it a little bit earlier today. But can you give us some more color on where you stand? And really what do you think the longer-term implications are for the profitability of the specialty business?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so, it's \u2013 one thing that may not have been immediately evident is we're just getting so much more granular about the business. And when we talked about our oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said in all different sites of care, even within specialty. So, we've got an increasing oral oncology business and we've got an increasing hospital business, which often gets done through ASD, as well as our traditional Oncology Supply and ION businesses. So there is just a lot of granularity and this is the first time we've really started measuring what we do in oncology, not just only in our specialty business. And we do a lot of oncology, by the way, of course, in our health system business, within drug, which is a really strong franchise for us also.","But on the manufacturer side, the manufacturers are increasingly looking at specialty as a different business, and they're looking at what components of the fee-for-service agreement do they want to see in a more specialty-oriented product. And those are traditional established manufacturers, the Lillys and Pfizers and Mercks of the world, as well as the more traditional specialty manufacturers that you associate with biotech products and specialty products. So, these fee-for-service agreements we have with manufacturers are becoming more nuanced and we expect that to continue. And that's why I'm pleased that under Peyton Howell's leadership we've got a really strong customer focused and manufacturer focused team that focuses on access and fastest delivery as well as the economics of these products.","I think we're managing through this very well. Almost every customer that we speak to understand these trends, and really, on the contracting side, the comments last quarter were probably more on the provider changing pricing environment as opposed to manufacturer changes where these trends have been well understood and we're more in constant fee-for-service negotiation discussions with manufacturers, the next generation as opposed to say, Kaiser, which is a five- or seven-year contract. Seven years last time, five years this time. And it's a very intermittent contracting opportunity. So those are really \u2013 I hope that's all clear, because it is very fluid and nuanced.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Ricky. Next question, please?","Operator","That comes from the line of Garen Sarafian, Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys. I guess I just wanted to touch on the Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Steve, you mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, could you just elaborate on what your expectations are and that you're building in for next year? I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I thought you hadn't grown this program as quickly as you might have wanted to recently. So curious what you've done thus far, if you could quantify the enthusiasm, the confidence last month and how you'll judge success in GNP for next fiscal year?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there are several ways we look at the number of pharmacies in our GNP, but what is important and I think this is what I feel especially good at after last week, and did get to meet with all of those key buying group customers and key regions. And like we've done in the rest of our business, we've signed the anchor tenants to long-term contracts. I met with all of them, candid discussions. They're not shy to voice their opinions, but overall, I think ABC has really taken \u2013 and you may be surprised of this, but it's not the impression you generally have \u2013 a very technology-enabled approach.","So I think when you look at the sort of apps that we had, we had this technology and innovation center at our trade show last week. I was there right when it opened because I was getting a preview of all the different offerings we had. So we had this virtual-reality-experience-type encounter where we showed the history, but also what the future of pharmacy could be like and there were just lines to see that. Some of the apps that we have, the ABC Order, we had 200 pharmacists that were involved in the development of that new interface, which is probably the way that our customers will be interfacing more and more with us.","So I think we're getting into a more digitally enabled Good Neighbor Pharmacy type environment. Bob Mauch talks a lot. When I was with him we met with customers, really about there's no reason that experience shouldn't be as rich as when you work with Amazon or one of these other primary e-commerce sites. And that's really what our goal is. And there was a lot of discussion on PassPort in the past, the generation of ordering interface that we're replacing about the search feature. Now the search feature's going to be just better.","I don't want to get into too much granularity, but we're really proud of \u2013 under the leadership of CIO, and this strong IT presence throughout the business, where we're moving the technology for our customers. And we all measure success through ProGen sales, through Good Neighbor Pharmacy membership, the Elevate participation, which is going extremely well, and I'm just pleased that we've got these key anchor tenants locked down and we can work on helping them grow. So it's not only the quantity, it's also the quality. And we feel good and we think there's upside there. I think we've maybe fallen back a percent or two and I think we hope to regain that, but really through growth of the services and investing in the customers that we have.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank, Garen. Next question, please.","Operator","And that's from the line of George Hill, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, Steve or Tim, I thought the comments that you made about the long-term EPS growth guidance answer was interesting. And I guess if we think about when we get through the fiscal 2017 guide, can you provide a framework around what gets the company back to the mid-teens EPS growth, and I guess, how much of it comes from core operating earnings growth versus capital deployment?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, hey, George, good morning. Yeah, I'll start, again, and Steve can jump in. But I think I would probably just recap some of the comments Steve made in his script. We believe having the right customers that are going to grow fast than markets, you've got grow their top-line, you've got to have good specialty. I would say, roughly speaking, that probably if 15% is the aspirational long-term goal, then probably two-thirds of that has to come from organic growth, kind of roughly speaking two-thirds organic, one-third capital deployment. That's roughly been the model in the past and that's probably what we'd shoot for looking forward.","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, free cash flow at 125% of net income will give us lots of opportunities. And we are very bullish about our customer mix manufacturer relationships. Of course, we are probably the most leveraged in the specialty pipeline, which is going to create a lot of dividends for us. I also remain tremendously optimistic about biosimilars and I think it's going to be a great driver for our Part D business, particularly, which you're starting to see panels get approvals on key products. So I think that'll be important with patient choice and provider choice and also provider profitability, which is important for us. So I'm really very optimistic about our future. That 15% we talked about is being aspirational, but there's no reason in some of the years that we couldn't hit that. I remain optimistic we can do that. But it is aspirational, do the 15% growth rate in any one year.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and just to finish up, we've always been a terrific cash-flow generator, and we don't see that changing once we go past 2017. And we've been very prudent. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to reinvest that for long-term shareholder value, and we'll keep doing that.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, George. Next question, please?","Operator","That's from the line of Robert Willoughby, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Tim, can you reiterate what the impact of the extended Walgreens relationship was on the income statement and balance sheet? I think you said something there, but are there- what incremental hits would you expect to see in the coming quarter? And if you had a quick sound bite on pricing for the animal health business, that would be great.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bob. Let me just comment in terms of the P&L, I think we've said before that there is not a P&L impact. We talked about last quarter, you know, extending the contract for the additional three years, but there is a cash flow impact that started this quarter. I talked about two cash flow impacts. I'm not going to size it, but clearly the timing was bigger than the Walgreens, to put that in perspective. But, yeah, going forward each quarter we'll have an investment and working capital on \u2013 a little bit on inventory and, we mentioned last time on terms. Hopefully that answers your question. Your second part was on pricing...","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pricing on animal health.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...on animal health. I think they remain part of their growth, especially on companion, which is in high-single digits, part of that is new introductions, which have been terrific for them. Part of it is new account penetration, and to a lower part, is probably pricing. It is a part of that growth, but clearly new account penetration, new drug introductions are a bigger part of that growth.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Next question, please?","Operator","That's from Steven Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning. Congrats on these results. So, historically it does seem that these distribution profits do tend to go up sequentially in the September quarter versus the June quarter. But obviously for this year, that guidance implies a little bit different trend. And just to make sure I got the factors there, you mentioned the manufacturers that had brand price increases in June instead of July, and I think maybe there is maybe the Kaiser renewal, but I forgot what were the other key factors again to consider when thinking about that sequential comparison?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, hey, Steve, it's Tim. Clearly one of the bigger ones as you look sequentially between three and four, one of the bigger ones would be the Kaiser repricing. It's a key account that got repriced. We'll have the one quarter impact this year, three quarters next year in 2017.","There were a couple of brand manufacturers that, again, you never know for sure. You forecast, a couple came earlier. That's a slight impact. We do tend to have a little bit of seasonality in our MWI business. June quarter tends to be stronger. I would say that those are the items, and traditionally, we always have a slight ramp in expenses in the fourth quarter, just around how we hire and in terms of compensation true-ups in that area. So that kind of is the reconciliation sequentially between three and four.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve. Next question, please?","Operator","And that's from Eric Percher, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to return to the earlier question on negotiations with manufacturers, and I think you called it providers or dispensers. The tone seems quite different from last quarter. Is that because last quarter there was a message of getting us in the mindset of the pressures that exist from the dispenser clients and high growth that maybe low-margin clients? And this quarter you're coming back and talking about some of the recourse you have with manufacturers. Am I reading that right?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, not sure. If we didn't have a tone that would denote anything except real confidence in our future, then I apologize. But no real tone. We weren't happy, I guess, Tim and I. All the team, we're very proud of our performance, proud of our results, so it was hard for us to take guidance down, but that's really all you saw. I mean, I think this quarter just affirms our confidence in our positioning, and the long-term opportunities for the business. Does that get to your question, Bob? Was that everything? Eric, is that good?","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","We may have lost Eric. But I think-","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, next question.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Yeah. Operator next question?","Operator","Yeah and that's from Ross Muken, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So just on capital allocations, you talked about obviously on a long-term basis an important part of the growth algorithm. More recently, the bias had sort of been growth diversification, but given where the stock is, and where valuation is, how are you thinking about the relevant tradeoffs of buying your own shares versus the continued moves and sort of new legs of the stool and the like?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for getting me ready, because we have our board meeting tomorrow on Thursday, so it's a good. It's the eternal question. You know, in the short-term, we almost always do best from buying our stock. But we really like doing the mixture, between dividends, between capital investments.","In fact, overall, the best returns we've had have been capital investments. But I've been \u2013 this is actually my 21st quarter, and I'm really proud of the three big acquisitions we've made. You know, they've worked out so well strategically, operationally, financially, and truly helped drive that overall portfolio effect. But we've done a terrific amount of share buybacks, and I'm also really proud that we've completely hedged the warrant. So, we've done a lot in all these different areas, and we do always evaluate any acquisition against our share buybacks. But in the long run, they tend to add some intangibles and some long-term benefits to the portfolio, and the value that we bring to manufacturers, to providers, to patients, that is \u2013 if they're thoughtfully done, it really is an excellent use of capital, along with some great internal projects like we talked about the ABC Order, the National Replenishment Center, many investments that we've made in oncology, Protocol Analyzer, products like that that are just terrific benefit to the customers, and really essentially make us much more relevant and sticky with the customers. So it's really a part of what our overall offering is. So anything to add, Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, Steve, I would just say we always like to be opportunistic, but you have to balance that against, you know, other demands for cash and having flexibility. That's what we do. We're very thoughtful about that, and we will consistently demonstrate that as we go forward. So it's a balance, and we're always looking at how best to deploy capital long term.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Ross. Next question, please.","Operator","And that's from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Tied to the renewal pricing on Kaiser, can you maybe just talk about the current pricing environment, and do you have anything sizable up for renewal in 2017? And then secondly, Steve, I just want to understand your comments when you talked about moving more contracts to fee-for-service. Can you remind us of the percentage of your contracts that are on fee-for-service-type relationships today? And where you think that can go over time?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no, we said last quarter that on the branded side that's about 90% plus, so \u2013 and we think it's just increasing, you know, with consolidations and just generally, a very transparent environment, and very bilateral discussions. I mean, you know, Peyton's team is in constant discussion with manufacturers, and I think it's just part of the evolution to mutually respectful, mutually beneficial and mutually valuable relationships. So that's really what I was referring to on the branded side. And I think you have some of those trends with generic manufacturers, with the consolidation that you're seeing there. But there's definitely room for some entrepreneurial startups, with some startups that can quickly, with some good execution and high quality can become pretty significant players in the generic market. And ABC's been proud to support some of those partners. So, the second part or the first \u2013 that was the second part of your question. Sorry, the first part of your question was on...","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Well, the share of brands...","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","...brand is in fee-for-service","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So I think we've got that, Lisa. Okay, okay.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","She's not on the line, so \u2013 I think we're coming up on the noon hour, so maybe we'll take one more question.","Operator","And that comes from Charles Rhyee, Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here. I want to touch on biosimilars a little bit. Steve, you talked a lot about it and one of your competitors, when they had referred to it, they talked about their ability to do well in some categories and maybe not \u2013 it won't be as beneficial in others. Obviously, you guys have a lot of experience in specialty. Can you talk about how you see that also shaping up? Is that kind of the right way to think about it that we have to look at biosimilars sort of class by class, and which ones in your mind are better suited for you guys to benefit from than others?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry, I knew there was something I didn't get to at least (55:01) and we don't have any large renewals in 2017 except for Express Scripts, which is in June of 2017, which is really a market-based contract and which we're going to start over in 2017.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","September of 2017.","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, that's one. Really on biosimilars, we're just a little bit reluctant to get into predicting when they're going to have a impact on us because you have the FDA process and then you have the court process, and those are just more difficult to predict. Having said that, I think there is an inevitable trend that we will have biosimilars in the marketplace and the panel reviews are showing equivalency and effectiveness that are coming. And again, we're very confident in the manufacturers that are reducing and are really seeing the development of these products, investing in them. And I know that our customers are very interested and open to trying it, so we just remain very optimistic.","And it's not just the distribution capabilities we have, it's companies like Xcenda. It's the patient work, the access work that we do at labs. It's the work that we'll do in complex products. Whatever they \u2013 however they need to be delivered, in whatever format they are, I'm really confident that our specialty group and our drug company will develop the solutions to be the manufacturer partners and help through reimbursement challenges, access challenges. So, I think that's really all we have time for, Barbara, is that our last question?","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Yes. It's one minute to noon. So maybe just any closing comments you have, Steve?","Steven H. Collis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm really pleased about the quality of this quarter's earnings. I think we made a lot of progress in all of our businesses. We're particularly pleased with the progress we made in our drug company. I think the specialty group with a 20% revenue growth really deserves strong recognition from our shareholders and all of us. Just another excellent performance on top of many years of excellent performance. So, again, Tim and I are pleased that our optimistic tone was acknowledged and recognized. And we thank you for your attention today.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. As always, we'll be around this afternoon to take any follow-up calls and questions anyone has. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 1:00 p.m. today running through August 9, 2016, at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Barbara. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and yearend results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2012, as well as our quarterly filings for fiscal 2013. Also AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the company's permission. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I am very pleased to report strong performance in our fourth quarter and solid results for our full year.","In fiscal 2013, we not only performed well operationally and financially, but we also took groundbreaking steps to strengthen the strategic position of our core business and continue to lay the groundwork for meaningful international expansion. We have made important investments in our infrastructure and we successfully divested certain assets while delivering exceptional value to our shareholders. We have excellent momentum heading into fiscal 2014 and I've never been more excited about our position in the market and the opportunities that lie ahead.","Since our formation in 2001, AmerisourceBergen has both a reputation for being, among other attributes, experts in capital management and excelling at operational execution. In the last few years, we have made substantial investments and established new customer relationships that enhance our ability to deliver growth while remaining focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain. We have improved our market-leading programs and services across our U.S. business. And we have begun to expand our specialty and manufacturer service offerings into important international markets. The changing health care landscape demands that providers continue to evolve to meet increasing patient demand and new economic realities.","In our core U.S. market, we are, of course, very mindful of the pending implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We have always believed that with increased coverage, there will be greater demand for pharmaceuticals groups. And while we are modestly optimistic of the positive opportunity for growth that the ACA can bring forth next year, we do not expect that any delays or changes to the Act will negatively impact the guidelines for our business, which is renowned for its resiliency in times of change.","Change is also impacting both brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, who also face an increasingly dynamic market with ability to get products to market as quickly and efficiently as possible and to secure reimbursement for those products are paramount. Our goal is to help all of our customers and suppliers effectively meet today's challenges and to find and benefit from new opportunities in an increasingly complex health care market.","In order to meet that objective, it is important to ensure that it is easy to do business with AmerisourceBergen on a global scale. Whether our customer is an independent retailer looking for globally sourced generics and fresh merchandising ideas or a sophisticated biotech manufacturer entering new markets and conducting drug trials across the world, we must deliver practical solutions that can be implemented quickly and without disruption.","Over the last few years, we worked deliberately to remove internal barriers to collaboration and build out an infrastructure that fosters great innovation and creativity. Our culture remains steadfastly focused on exceeding customer expectations and our organization is flat enough to ensure fast response times. As a result, we continue to roll out new innovative programs. And the team feels like we always have more than we can and want to accomplish.","It is a source of great pride to me and our senior executives as to how exceptionally well AmerisourceBergen met and indeed exceeded every customer expectation that was placed in front of them during this year of incredible change for our company.","This strategic relationship we struck with Walgreens and Alliance Boots in March has greatly elevated our core business platform and opportunities, allowing us to take our strategy for our business to the next level. When we made the announcement, we declared we had an unprecedented opportunity among the 3 companies to create and develop a unique and differentiated global platform. Seven months into this significant announcement, I feel stronger than ever that this relationship has created meaningful opportunities for us to further enhance our operations and customer value.","For example, the additional volume flowing through our system now affords us the opportunity to make the investment to expand our Columbus greenfield facility and establish a international distribution center. When fully operational at the end of calendar 2014, the greatly expanded facility will give manufacturers a new service option for greater supply chain efficiency with AmerisourceBergen and will drive benefits for our own operations as well.","In addition, we plan to replace our existing Orlando, Florida distribution center with a state-of-the-art facility that is over 50% larger than the current facility. Both of these important investments will yield benefits to AmerisourceBergen's stakeholders for many years to come.","We're also making an important investment in information technology infrastructure in order to meet future regulatory requirements intended to further enhance the integrity and security of the pharmaceutical supply chain. We have worked closely with many others in the supply chain to identify a comprehensive and workable solution for enhancing our products or track as they move through the supply chain, and we are hopeful that federal legislation will soon set a national standard. Our solution is a fully integrated program that takes advantage of the robust capabilities our SAP platform provides and delivers a single seamless way for manufacturers, in particular, to interact with all of AmerisourceBergen. Once implemented, our solution will also position us to manage various international regulations as needed.","I truly believe that the comprehensive global supply chain strategy we have deployed and the collaborative approach we have taken to doing business not only drives efficiency but also leads to growth and opportunity for our customers and those we serve. Our growing relationships with both brand and generic manufacturers was on display at last month's supply chain ThinkLive trade show where ABC had record attendance from our supplier partners. Our 1 ABC approach in forming relationships resonates with those constituencies that know and depend on our capabilities day in and day out. I believe they fully embrace ABC's enhanced platform and welcome an increased role for AmerisourceBergen in driving innovation and value for the supply chain.","Turning now to our results. Tim will cover the details, but I want to take a quick look back on our September quarter and our fiscal 2013 before I talk more explicitly about our financial expectations for fiscal 2014.","Our revenue was up 28% in the September quarter to $24.5 billion, with a sharp increase due to the on-boarding of the Walgreens brand distribution business. Adjusted earnings per share were up 3% to $0.79 in the quarter. Better-than-expected generic inflation helped offset the headwind from fewer generic launches and additional expenses related to on-boarding Walgreens. Price inflation on both brand and generic products was quite strong in fiscal 2013. Sales of generics have been strong across the board with only a handful of products contributing the majority of these price increases. While we continue to expect to see some level of inflation going forward, generic inflation is difficult to predict. We believe the most recent increases have been extraordinary, and we do not expect them to continue at the same high rates.","The pharmaceutical distribution segment overall had solid growth in the quarter with a 34% revenue increase in the Drug Company and a 12% increase in ABSG. I want to take a moment here and give a special word of thanks to our direct company associates for the stellar job they did on-boarding the brand business for over 8,000 Walgreens stores. The successful rollout is a testament to the talent and dedication of our associates and the value of working collaboratively with the customer. We challenged our associates to continue exceeding all of our customer expectations while implementing the significant contract.","I have been at AmerisourceBergen for almost 20 years, and despite the momentousness of this challenge, I've never had a doubt our associates would rise to the occasion as they irrefutably did this year. Importantly, the drug companies other customer categories also performed well in the quarter. Sales to independent drugstores increased sequentially in the quarter and we continue to have an open dialogue with these important customers about the opportunities we see on the horizon. Importance of our independent offering was verified recently when the J.D. Power 2013 U.S. National Pharmacy Study ranked our Good Neighbor Pharmacy, our franchise offering, the highest in customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies. This is quite an honor for the GNP franchise and our members and a well-deserved recognition of the extraordinary level of service they provide to their patients.","ABSG's revenues in the quarter were up 12%, as strong performance in Besse, ASD and ICS offset a decline in oncology business. While our oncology supply sales have stabilized somewhat, community practices continue to face a challenge of inadequate reimbursement. We consistently encourage members of Congress to repeal the sequestration cuts that have negatively impacted community oncology physicians. But of course, there's no immediate relief in such. We continue to expect that our community oncology business will be down year-over-year until it anniversaries the impact of sequestration. It is possible that if inadequate reimbursement rates persist for a long period of time, we could see additional pressure on community oncology sales.","Due to some well-established shifts inside of case service, we are experiencing a lot of growth in hospital outpatient sales of oncology products. And we believe that our knowledge of specialty products and our differentiated understanding of manufacturer and patient requirements for these products will help AmerisourceBergen's overall offering, whether it is in our specialty business, ABCS or our core drug business.","Turning now to World Courier and our consulting businesses. Both performed well in the quarter with a strong performance in last year in particular, driving operating income growth of 24%. For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 13% to a record $88 billion across all of AmerisourceBergen. And we delivered $3.14 in adjusted EPS, an increase of 6%. We accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2013. And while 2014 will be a transition year, it positions us very well for a bright future built upon a foundation of strong and diverse customer relationships, innovative partnerships and a dynamic marketplace.","Before I go into fiscal 2014 guidance, I think it is worth mentioning the key priorities that our management team has established for 2014. One, continuing to onboard all of the Walgreens distribution business. Two, partnering with a Swiss JV in negotiating global generics sourcing agreements. Three, strengthening our independent retail programs. Four, driving the expansion of specialty offerings across our entire business. Five, expanding our service offerings in international markets by building upon the World Courier platform.","For our guidance, it bears repeating that we are changing how we calculate adjusted diluted earnings per share in an effort to provide our business with greater clarity and transparency. Tim will walk through the details. But on the basis we will use going forward, fiscal 2013 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.21. On the same basis, we expect fiscal 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.73, an increase of 12% to 16%. We will, of course, have exceptionally strong revenue growth of 28% to 31%, as a result of on-boarding the Walgreens business, which also will drive strong operating income growth.","While we anticipate a modest benefit to our top line from Health Care Reform in fiscal 2014, it is ramping a little slower than originally anticipated and we probably will expect a greater bit impact in fiscal 2015.","Our operating margins will be negatively impacted by the mixed shift to lower margin business, but we continue to expect that we will be able to grow our operating margins after we anniversary the on-boarding of Walgreens.","Our capital expenditure expectation is significantly higher than prior years. But as I outlined earlier, we continue to make important investments in our business that will provide benefits and opportunities for growth for a long time to come. Throughout my career, I have learned that well thought out and executed technology investments have been very beneficial to our business. They not only drive efficiency but help us establish the customer intimacy and ease of doing business that ABC is characterized by.","It also helps us to be a leader in compliance and ahead of any regulatory challenges that may arise. We expect our strong cash flow generation will continue, though with some timing impacts as we inboard -- onboard Walgreens. We do, however, continue to have financial flexibility and we will deploy capital wisely and with a view to both growing our business and returning funds to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in shares in fiscal 2014, but likely in the latter part of the year. We also continue to have an increased -- an interest and acquisitions, particularly in specialty and manufacturer services, and potentially on the international front as well.","In conclusion, we are very pleased with both the performance we've had in the last year and the degree to which we have been able to execute against our strategic priorities. As we continue to expand our relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, further develop our global pharmaceutical sourcing strategy and work to ensure a bright future for all of our customers, I have great confidence that our associates will continue to rise to the occasion. We have accomplished a great deal in the last year and I've never felt better about our future.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a very strong finish to what has been a solid year and we're pleased with our fiscal '13 results. We did this while executing on several strategic initiatives. It's interesting to note that we started our fiscal year servicing our large PBM partner under a new contract. And we finished this fiscal year servicing our large chain partner, Walgreens, under our expanded distribution contract.","This morning, as has been our practice this year, I will provide my initial comments on our GAAP financial results. I will then adjust for the exclusion of the 2 material noncash items, the LIFO expense and the warrant expense, including the negative impact on our tax rate from the warrants. As a reminder, results from fiscal '12 will be on a GAAP basis when I make any comparisons.","I have 3 main items to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I will spend a few minutes on our full year performance. The third item, I will wrap up my prepared comments covering our fiscal '14 guidance.","In order to facilitate an easier comparison between fiscal '13 and fiscal '14, at the end of my comments, I will also provide our adjusted earnings for fiscal '13 on the new adjusted basis, which we will use going forward.","Let's begin our review of ABC's fourth quarter '13 financial results. Starting with the top line, revenues were $24.5 billion, up 28% compared to last year's quarter. The increase was due to incremental revenues from our new large contracts, our PBM and Walgreens distribution contracts. If we were to exclude the growth associated with these 2 meaningful contracts, our revenue growth would still have been a very good 4.4%. We did benefit from having 1 extra business day this September quarter.","The current quarter's GAAP gross profit decreased to $568 million due to the LIFO charge of $154 million, this charge was significantly higher than previously expected due to much better-than-expected drug price increases in Q4. Traditionally, a slower time period for price increases. We had record brand price inflation for our inventory mix for both Q4 and also the full year. Also Q4 included a limited number of generic drugs that had large price increases. Excluding LIFO from just the current quarter, our adjusted gross profit was up 1% to approximately $722 million. Last year's gross profit benefited from a LIFO credit and antitrust income of about $26 million. As highlighted in our previous 2 quarters, we continued to experience a headwind in gross profit in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment due to fewer new generic launches year-over-year. However, this quarter, this headwind was mitigated by stronger price appreciation related to generic drugs.","Let's move to operating expenses. This quarter, total GAAP operating expenses were $453 million, up about $58 million or about 15%. Included in these GAAP expenses is warrant expense of about $50 million. The driver behind the sequential warrant expense increase is the current fair value of the warrants. At September 30, the warrants were valued at $572 million, which was greater than the June 30 value of $468 million. The fair value of the warrants increased primarily due to the ABC's share price in the quarter ended September 2013.","Operating expenses excluding the warrant expense were about $403 million in the current quarter, up $8 million or about 2% over last year's quarter. However, last year's quarter had a burden of a large onetime restructuring charge in the amount of $27 million. Without the impact of the restructuring expenses, our OpEx would have increased about 9%. This increase was related to our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, specifically the Drug Company and also corporate IT, both in support of the on-boarding of our new Walgreens contract.","Operating expenses in the Other segment were virtually flat.","Operating income. Our GAAP operating income was $114 million, down significantly due to the material LIFO and warrant expenses. However, excluding LIFO and the warrants from the September '13 quarter only, our adjusted operating income would have been $319 million, above flat compared to last year's quarter.","Our adjusted operating margin was 1.30%, down 37 basis points compared to last September quarter, due to the significant increase in lower margin business and the expenses of on-boarding the Walgreens contract.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense of approximately $19 million in the current quarter decreased about 19% compared to last year, due to the debt that we paid off in September of 2012.","Income taxes. Our GAAP effective income tax rate was nearly 48%. As mentioned last quarter, our income tax rate is being negatively impacted by warrants expense. On an adjusted basis, which means we are removing the nondeductible dollars associated with the warrants, our effective tax rate for the September 2013 quarter was 38.2%.","Our GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the September quarter was $0.22. Our adjusted diluted EPS, consistent with how we provided our revised EPS guidance, which means excluding LIFO, the warrants expense and warrant tax impact from the current September quarter only, was $0.79, an increase of about 3%.","Our EPS benefited from a 5% reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding versus the prior year quarter. There was no accounting dilution in our share count from the unexercised equity warrants in the September quarter. At September 30, 2013, we had approximately 230 million shares outstanding.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the September quarter, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Please note that I will exclude the impact of the fiscal '13 LIFO expense. Warrant expense is recorded outside of our segment results. Total revenues were $24.1 billion, up nearly 30% versus the same quarter last year. Drug Company led the way with revenues up 34% due to 2 primary drivers. One, incremental revenues from our large PBM customer. As a reminder, this month, October, we have now lapped the start of this contract. And two, we also benefited from starting to distribute brand drugs to Walgreens for the 1 month, September. The Walgreens revenues tracked to what was expected.","Specialty Group's revenues increased 12%. Consistent with other quarters this year, Besse Medical ASD and our ICS 3PO business led the way with above-market revenue performance, having combined growth of about 20%. Our oncology supply business was down about 4%. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and specialty are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we've communicated these growth rates in the past.","Moving to gross profit. As mentioned earlier, this segment had a benefit in the September 2012 quarter of $26 million from a LIFO credit and antitrust income. Excluding this headwind, our Drug Company was up in the September quarter due to very strong generic price appreciation and, to a lesser degree, contributions from the new Walgreens contract, offset by the headwinds caused by the previously announced PBM contract repricing, a GPO customer loss and a modest generic launch year. The generic price appreciation was limited to a handful of drugs that had large price increases, some of which were related to supply disruptions. The Specialty Group had 8% gross profit growth due to the strong revenues that I highlighted, offset by the continued reimbursement headwind in oncology supply.","Adjusted pharmaceutical distribution operating income was about $300 million, and down 9% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the $26 million benefit from the LIFO credit and the antitrust income from the September 2012 quarter, this segment's operating income was essentially flat. Our Specialty Group had a strong quarter with operating income growth in the high teens, driven primarily by their gross profit growth. The drug company's operating income decreased and offset the specialty increase. Drug Company had an increase in operating expenses related to the on-boarding of Walgreens, primarily labor, delivery costs and IT support costs.","Moving to the Other reporting segment. As a reminder, this segment is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. Segment revenues increased about 3% to $434 million in the current quarter. In the September quarter, World Courier corrected intracompany, cross divisional revenues in the amount of $30 million. This year-to-date, cumulative correction negatively impacted their top line revenue for the quarter. There was not an impact to their operating income.","Segment operating income increased a strong 24% to nearly $22 million from the same quarter last year. Our consulting business had an increase in operating income, partially driven by timing of key medical programs shifted to July this fiscal year versus being recognized in the June quarter last year.","Let me switch gears and cover a few key full year financial metrics. Overall, we did very well meeting or exceeding our revised guidance targets. Revenue growth. On a full year basis, our growth was 12.7%, near the top of our revised guidance range. Our large PBM customer contract drove most of this increase and, to a lesser degree, new revenues from our Walgreens contract. Our specialty business finished the year with revenue growth of just under 8%. Again, led by Besse Medical, ASD and ICS, up a combined 20%. This was offset by a 10% decline in oncology supply revenues due to reimbursement pressures, as mentioned previously, and to a lesser degree, brand to generic conversions.","Our adjusted operating income, excluding LIFO and the warrant expense from the full fiscal year, decreased about 3% to $1.27 billion. Our adjusted operating margin decreased by 23 basis points to 1.44% from 1.67%.","EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which excludes LIFO and the negative warrant impacts, was $3.14, above our expectations due to a strong fourth quarter and primarily due to the benefit of the higher-than-expected generic price appreciation.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our full year capital expenditures were $202 million, and included about $50 million related to on-boarding Walgreens. Free cash flow was $586 million, significantly better than our revised guidance of $100 million to $200 million. As part of this -- part of this improvement is due to timing, as our brand inventory build for Walgreens was slightly lower than what we originally expected. And we had an especially strong September cash collections month. The additional brand inventory was on-boarded in early to mid-October.","During the September quarter, our share buybacks were $83 million. And for the full year, we bought back $484 million of shares, which exceeded our guidance of $400 million for the year. We are proud of our track record of upsizing our return of capital to shareholders. We ended the fiscal year with about $1.1 billion available on our share repurchase authorizations.","Moving to our hedging program. As a reminder, this program enables ABC to offset a reasonable amount of the anticipated share dilution from the anticipated exercise of the warrant through the purchase of 4 cap call options. At September 30, 2013, we have completed about 60% of the hedge at a cost of roughly $160 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we can adjust our hedging activities based on market conditions at any time. We now expect the program to be completed in early fiscal '14.","Finally, our cash balance of about $1.2 billion at September 30 leaves us in a good position as we navigate through a large, complex Walgreens on-boarding from a working capital standpoint.","Now let's turn to fiscal 2014 expectations. As we discussed earlier, our guidance going forward will be on a new adjusted basis. Perspectively, our new definition of adjusted earnings will exclude LIFO adjustments, expenses associated with the equity warrants and related tax impact, acquisition-related expenses and intangible amortization, as well as any onetime restructuring, litigation and severance expenses. We have also decided to exclude antitrust litigation gains, which are infrequent and difficult to predict. Finally, we will calculate adjusted EPS using an adjusted share count, which will exclude the accounting dilution resulting from the impact of the unexercised equity warrants. Our guidance this morning excludes any impact from these items.","On the new basis, our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2013 was $3.21. Gross profit was $2.76 billion and the gross margin was 3.14%. The operating income and margin for fiscal '13 was $1.29 billion and 1.47%, respectively. On this basis, our expectations for fiscal 2014 are as follows: EPS, we expect fiscal '14 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.73. Again, we consider $3.21 as our base fiscal '13 adjusted EPS number; revenues, we expect revenue growth to be in the 28% to 31% range, driven primarily by our new Walgreens contract, with 11 months of incremental brand drug revenue and the phasing end of generics. Included in our revenue forecast is a modest increase from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Finally, we expect our specialty business to grow between 7% and 10%, with our oncology supply business just up slightly. Gross profit. Our gross profit dollars will be up in fiscal '14, but our gross profit margin will be down substantially due to the Walgreens business and because we continue to expect the benefit from the procurement joint venture to come later in our fiscal year. Also our Specialty Group's mix of business also negatively impacts our gross profit margin as certain of their lower margin businesses are growing faster.","Although we had a strong fiscal year in terms of brand and generic price appreciation, our working assumption for fiscal '14 is that price appreciation will moderate and return to more normal levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect year-over-year dollar growth as a percentage to be in the low teens. The increase is driven primarily from 3 key areas. One, on-boarding the Walgreens business and direct costs such as payroll and delivery. Two, an increase in overall corporate support costs, most notably IT. It's important to point out that our continued investment in IT, while tied to the Walgreens contract implementation, will benefit all of our current customers and importantly, allow for future growth. And three, certain non-capitalizable expenses associated with building a replacement Florida DC, expanding our Columbus facility to also serve as a national distribution center and implementing a track-and-trace system.","Finally, our operating expenses are somewhat dependent upon how quickly and efficiently we onboard the Walgreens generic business. You can count on ABC to manage operating expenses responsibly. For fiscal '14, we expect our operating income year-over-year dollar growth to be in the range of 12% to 16%, primarily driven by the Drug Company. Additionally, we expect our operating margin to decrease in basis points in the high teens. For specialty, we expect operating income to be relatively flat as the income contribution from the 3 fast-growing businesses will offset the lower contribution from our oncology supply business.","Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to increase year-over-year as a percentage in the low teens. This is due to anticipated short-term borrowings in the first half of the fiscal year. We funded higher accounts payable in October from the Walgreens brand inventory build. We will need to fund additional working capital needs as we continue to phase in the Walgreens business. And around the end of December, we have our usual seasonality where we add inventory in our drug business.","Tax rate. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 38% range. Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes $500 million in share repurchases. Importantly, we'd expect the majority of the share repurchases to be in the second half of the fiscal year when our working capital improves.","Switching over to our cash flow. Capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $300 million in fiscal '14. Since announcing our new strategic relationship last March, we have recognized that we need additional investment in several areas. I previously discussed the replacement DC in Florida, the national distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and the track-and-trace system. Additionally, from an IT standpoint, we plan to invest CapEx dollars to ensure that we have properly scaled SAP and EDI Systems in our Drug Company with appropriate capabilities to handle the projected doubling of order volume and to support future growth.","We are also scheduled to install and upgrade to our core SAP system and implement SAP in our World Courier business this year. The CapEx spend for these 6 initiatives is about 60% of the total CapEx spend, and will mostly be completed late in the fiscal year. As Steve highlighted, these CapEx projects position us better for the long term.","Finally, free cash flow. We expect that our free cash flow will be in the $500 million to $700 million range. Free cash flow is impacted by the additional CapEx spend, additional brand inventory build needed for Walgreens and a slightly higher level of invoices paid in October related to the Q4 brand inventory build. A critical positive driver of free cash flow is the phase-in of the Walgreens generic business, which we continue to assume will be slow and steady over calendar 2014. We can have a material change in our free cash flow based on how this generic business actually gets implemented.","I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to all the moving parts, so thank you for your attention. Let me finish by reiterating we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the full year.","For fiscal 2014, we expect solid organic growth. We are doing this while investing in a number of internal initiatives to strengthen our business long term. The future continues to look very bright for AmerisourceBergen.","Now here is Barbara for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Brad.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Obviously, last week, McKesson announced the acquisition of Celesio, so can you just talk about how do you think that partnership will impact -- potentially impact JV negotiations with manufacturers? Or do you think that you have a first-mover advantage there?","Steven H. Collis","Well, Ricky, we weren't surprised by the announcement, but we're really very confident in our position. First of all, we believe that we have best-in-category partners here. The scale of this relationship is unique. And we also -- we have the benefit of not only did we go through a couple of months of negotiation, but we've now proactively worked on market solutions for over 7 months, and it's going very well. So you get into acquisitions, there's still regulatory hurdles to be faced. So we don't think there's any impact on our business. Again, we think that this relationship has been positively received by the manufacturers. I think it gives them some really unique global access that no one else can offer. And the other thing is AmerisourceBergen was the third party in this relationship, and there was already a well-established and well thought out integration plan between Alliance Boots and Walgreens. And in a way, we benefited from fitting into that, so we think we're ahead here. We like how we're positioned. And as you can see, we've got great confidence. I mean, 12% to 16% operating growth for fiscal '14.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And when we think about '14 guidance, and maybe I've missed it, but is there any issuance benefits from improved sourcing? And also, is there any update to your thoughts of high single-digit basis for margin expansion in fiscal year '15, given what you know to date?","Steven H. Collis","We gave Tim a bit of a break, and we'll get him to answer parts of your question. But we expect the sourcing benefits to accrue later in the year. And it's -- there's, of course, tremendous interest in this but we really are in this for the long term. We signed a 10-year distribution agreement with Walgreens and we've entered into this agreement really on the generic sourcing with the Bergen JV with really the belief that this is going to be permanent. So we really are being very thoughtful about it. We think we're providing a lot of growth to our shareholders and we really want to manage the market for the long term. So you will see full benefits. There are better benefits from that in '15 but...","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve. Hi, Ricky. I would just say, before I get into the question, I'd just like to echo '14 guidance, strong organic growth. We expect -- what we said before is still consistent for '15. We expect that margin to improve. We said at least high single-digits. That's still our answer, what we're committed to, it's early. A lot of moving parts. We got to navigate through '14 first, a lot of complexity. But we certainly need a longer runway underneath us here before we really get into details on '15.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, now that you're 7 months into the transition with Walgreens. Could you maybe give some reactions to maybe what some of your independent customers domestically may be saying? Are using any pushback or any disruption in that regard?","Steven H. Collis","Well, obviously, when we made this announcement on March 19, I think, there was a lot of market attention to this. And what's happened since then, in many cases, again, at our trade show in July, we are met with a couple of customers who had been with us in the Good Neighbor Pharmacy program for 29 years. So we have long established relationship with customers, and many of them trust us. We highly -- many of them trust us implicitly, I think they're just with us for the long-term. And said that they understood. I mean, when I gave my remarks at the opening keynote speech at this conference, there was, I think, tremendous interest in that, we had a lot of attendance. But there's a lot of confidence that AmerisourceBergen is going to do the right thing for them. And they know the generics and the ProGen program are very important to the future of the Swiss JV and very important to us. And of course, it's a key area of profitability for them. So I think, it's up to us. We intend to execute against some of the non-generic sourcing priorities of this agreement. So there's areas in the front store, there's areas in network development, technology and clinical enhancements that we can offer, I've given some pretty rudimentary examples of little things that we can do around script translation that gives us the capabilities and the scale to do it, even in areas of patient-specific compounding. So I think there are lots of areas for us to help the independent base and they trust us. We haven't seen any significant loss or any loss at all, really, from the independent customer base, so things are really going well.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's good to hear. Tim, maybe if I could just sort of follow-up on one question with respect to the purchasing JV. When you guys originally gave your accretion estimates for the combined transaction, it seemed at the time that you were sort of conveying that the benefits from the purchasing joint venture may actually be bigger than the prime vendor agreement itself. And if that's the case, we're not going to see the benefits from the prime vendor agreement towards the latter half of fiscal '14. Might the accretion benefits in fiscal '15 be ultimately bigger than what we've seen in '14 based on that original premise?","Tim G. Guttman","Hey, Glenn. We did -- clearly, we said that, we still believe it. We still believe that the procurement JV is ultimately going to be better. It's just a matter of how quickly we can ramp up. It's complicated. You have to contract and go through that process. So again, we always said a little bit in '14, mostly in '15, but ultimately, ultimately, it's going to have a contribution greater than the core distribution agreement. Am I ready to really comment about '15 in terms of accretion? Again, I think, with Ricky, I think I answered a lot of moving parts, complicated, we're not really ready to put the stake on the ground in terms of accretion for '15. We're still committed, but nothing's changed. We're still committed to solid mid-teens EPS growth over the long term.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve or Tim, is there an argument for perhaps including the warrant dynamics in the income statement to reflect the 20% of the upside here to the numbers that you're basically giving away now? And are there any other scenarios that do enable you to revisit the terms or conditions around the warrants?","Tim G. Guttman","Bob, I'll take the question first, and Steve can jump in. But again, I would say, we're down the road on the relationship. It's contracted. It's been a pleasant surprise. I mean, we're benefiting from a great relationship partnership. And again, it's tied to the procurement JV, which again, with Glenn, we said we still believe that it's ultimately going to be very promising. So at this point, no, there's -- I'd say it's remote and not likely that we'd ever renegotiate and really, the upside of the warrant valuation wouldn't flow through the P&L.","Steven H. Collis","I think, if I called Greg and Stefano and said I want to renegotiate the warrant process, they might think it's not Halloween but April 1. So I don't think that's a possibility. It's a good thought. But honestly, when we negotiate this contract, it was really a year ago. Our stock was steady 43 to 45, and so it reflected some modest premium over that price at the time but markets are unpredictable.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the potential savings from the JV. Steve, at this point, how much visibility do you have into those potential savings? Are the savings more tied to timing at this point or are there still several unknowns that would need to be worked through to realize those savings?","Steven H. Collis","Well, we're very involved in the JV. I was in Switzerland last month. We have people there -- it's not every week, at least a couple of times a month, so we have been very participatory in the discussions because the complexity of the end-market pricing in the U.S. really affects us across a broad range of customers from other regional chains that we have to the independent pharmacies to long-term care and institutional pharmacy, skilled nursing facilities. So I think that's one of the key learnings we've had. So we've been very involved, the participation by AmerisourceBergen generic sourcing and business development folks is being extremely welcome. And we're involved. So we have a lot of visibility but we're right in the thick of things. So we expect that we'll give you further guidance as the year continues. But honestly, nothing has changed. In fact, our expectations are probably more positive than ever about the opportunities that our manufacturers are seeing from this global relationship.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I guess, just on generic pricing in general. Steve, you flagged that inflation has been extraordinary but that you don't expect that to continue at these same high rates. Is the assumption in guidance for flat generic pricing? And I guess, if it is, what are some of the factors that can make this inflation better or worse than your expectations?","Steven H. Collis","I think, the keyword that we used that if we didn't use, we should have, is concentration. There were just a couple of products on both brand and generic that really had outside contributions to hard and expected inflation rates. And if those circumstances persist, it could happen again. But I think, we heard comments from both our peer companies that are very consistent with us, that you have some unique circumstances here and it's difficult for us to predict that they'll continue. It's part of why we have a range of earnings. But, Tim, any comments.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. I would say it's a good question. It's '13, '13 was clearly better than '12 in terms of generic price appreciation, but as Steve mentioned, it's isolated, concentrated. We're not ready to call it the new norm at this point. So that's -- we factored that into our guidance, that's why we have a range, and I guess, Bob, the other thing I'd like to point out too on that range for next year is we have 2 big generic launches and they're both tied to 1 supplier. So again, that's part of why you have a range in terms of generic price appreciation and generic launches, things can change and move and develop.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tom Gallucci with FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess, first of all, in your comments, you mentioned maybe a little bit of benefit in your expectations from health care reform. You recognized, I think, maybe a little slower ramp. But could you give us a little better understanding of the calculations and how you're thinking about reform?","Steven H. Collis","Well, Tom, congratulations on the new position and we look forward to working with you, of course. We really do work more on the IMS [ph] guidance. I mean, I don't want you to take anything away from that, that we're not sophisticated and don't look at different customers and their growth rates because we really do. In the last few years, we -- tremendous attention on that and we've got, of course, some very large customers that we consult with and also down to the GNP stores. So we spent a lot of time on it but we don't particularly look at what the impact would be. When we've see that TennCare expand and we have a very strong independent patient, independent pharmacy population and customer base there, we've seen some very good growth. And so our assumption is being at Medicaid and Affordable Care Act expansion will be good for us but we never thought about it in more than about a 2% increase in revs at the absolute most. And now, we've moderated that, but we've got 28% to 31% revenue growth next year, so we probably aren't obsessing about it every percentage of revenue growth, really focusing on it bottom line and operational implementation. And frankly, they're very big capital investments that we're making next year, which will be a record for AmerisourceBergen.","Tim G. Guttman","I think, Steve, boy, you definitely -- you hit it. I mean, I think, again, I said, modest and we're still bullish, we still think it's going to be a good ramp and could be a real positive for '15, but very modest for '14. And ultimately, it should be good for our retail, for chain and our independents. But again, not a big factor for '14.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. One more. I guess, just the prime vendor agreement and the purchasing organization, clearly, you're the biggest here relative to the Walgreens-Alliance Boots relationship. But in the past, you've also talked a bit -- or maybe about it being a platform of World Courier to expand your specialty operations internationally. Anything there that you might want to offer?","Steven H. Collis","So Alliance Boots has got just tremendous assets and we're talking to them more and more frequently as we've got through the implementation of the Web contract. That was our first priority. And I'd say we got through the brand, we still have the generics to do. But for example, we're looking at what percentages could be with our Good Neighbor pharmacy. We're looking at the different third-party logistics businesses that Alliance Boots has and their interest in being more involved in specialty and institutional business. So we have a lot of meetings and it just takes some time. We've talked to a couple of emerging bio and specialty manufacturers about their interest in doing a global contract between the 3 companies. And we're confident that we're going to get some good case studies here, it's just going to take some time. But this is one of the long-term upsides for this relationship and nothing that we've seen really defers our optimism that this can be accomplished.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Tim, can you just touch on the distribution, selling and administrative expenses? There was a sequential pop there. Any thoughts on sort of the run rate going through '14, please?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Dave, I would -- well, again, I would say that in my comments, I talked about the expenses being up in Pharmaceutical Distribution in Q4. Again, primarily related to the Drug Company. And again, in terms of the run rate, I would say that, that run rate -- 1 quarter this year, as we ramp up for September, in terms of we gave you some guidance for next year in terms of the increase, so we'll have 3 incremental quarters next year. Part of what's driving that increase for OpEx for next year, we're not that -- we're probably 40% or 50% done in terms of hiring staffing in our DCs. We still have a lot of volume to go, bringing on the generics business and there's going to be some duplicate costs. So again, that's part of what's driving that increase in our guidance for OpEx for '14. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, I just had a question around the generic purchasing and in burn, is there going to be any type of tax benefit to Amerisource by some of the business that you're doing there?","Steven H. Collis","We've really focused on getting the generic contract implemented, so we're hoping to do our first Walgreens generic performance distribution business next year. And then, that ties in sequentially over the next couple of quarters to the contract launches, so that's really been our focus. Definitely something that we will contemplate in the long term, but no attribution for that next year at all yet.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, secondly, you called out both independent increase in sales sequentially, as well as your large PBM customer buying incremental products from you. Can you maybe just give us some idea of is this that you're deepening your relationship around generics? Is it your -- those customers are buying what type of more products from you, is it something specific and the reason why you called them each out?","Steven H. Collis","With the large PBM customer, I think, they hopefully enjoy ordering from AmerisourceBergen and found us to be a great partner and easy to do business with. So some more and more brand lines have been added to the distribution contract. With generics, where we're seeing a lot of success is frankly also in the health systems area as there's more generic penetration there. I think, we've had some real strong enhancements in the contracting we have with hospital GPO, so that's where we're seeing a lot of benefit. And also, just a stronger hospital environment. We've always had a probably not as well-understood hospital practice that we have some of the leading hospital systems in the country as customers and definitely some of the winners in Affordable Care Act implementation and accountable care organization. So we definitely are benefiting from some of the trends there.","Operator","And that final question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I think, you addressed this in your comments but the Other segment revenue missed my target by about $30 million. I think, you've said there was a true-up of $30 million, I was hoping you could clarify that. More importantly, when we think about the outlook for that segment going into next year, I didn't catch your targeted growth rates in margin in that segment. I think, you made references to ABSG and ABDC, but maybe not so much to the Other segment, so I was hoping we could get some outlook on that?","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Eric, it's Tim, I'll take this one. In my prepared comments, I mean, we had a change in leadership there in finance with a new person coming on board. We've realized that some cross-divisional revenues were not properly eliminated, and again, we needed to do that. If you -- and that was a year-to-date adjustment in August, about $30 million. If you kind of back out the -- if you back out what was related to previous quarters, the growth, the sales growth would have been, I think, about 9% for that Other segment. Again, pretty strong, no impact on operating income. Essentially, they kind of grossed up the revenue. You're right, we're actually going to wait until Investor Day and give some more specific guidance on that Other segment, so we didn't give it today. But I would expect revenue growth to be in the high single-digits, pretty consistent with what we've said, a little bit of margin expansion, mid to high single-digits, pretty consistent, both doing pretty well. And remember that Other segment, in that Other segment, a big chunk of that Other segment is distribution business associated with consulting, so it's a large dollar business at a low margin. So again, it distorts that overall Other segment a bit. Hopefully, that helps.","Barbara A. Brungess","And thanks, Eric. With that, we'll turn it over to Steve to make some closing remarks.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you. I was actually hoping for a question on oncology, and let me just say that we're very proud of our oncology business and we've been a leader there for over 10 years. Though we're seeing some shifts, we just -- we do have a very strong oncology business. And we believe we're maintaining our market share. And also, we have terrific associates that are so knowledgeable and dedicated in our oncology business and we're really proud of the job that they're doing every day. And if you think about it, we have almost 20% of the market captive within 1 account that we have no chance to win. So when you retain over 50% market share, it's very, very difficult. So we think our future looks good. We think that there have been some pipeline issues and so no one asked me the questions, so I'm just going to say that, and I know our remarks have been long, and you've all had a very busy day. So I just hope that Tim and I have effectively communicated the pride we have in all of AmerisourceBergen is completed in fiscal 2013. If you think about the divestitures and the business expansions we've had, it's a year that I just couldn't be more proud of. And then, you look at how we positioned for 2014, and the 13% to 16% -- sorry, 12% to 16% operating income growth that we projected, that's pretty remarkable. So we feel great about AmerisourceBergen. We hope that we've communicated that to you and that we wish you a very happy Halloween.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. And before we go, I just want to highlight a few of our upcoming events. We'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day in New York on December 12. We will be attending the Goldman Sachs CEOs Unplugged Conference in Boston on January 7. And we'll be attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on or about January 14.

At participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bennett Murphy","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen\u2019s fiscal 2020 first quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO, and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today\u2019s call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today\u2019s press release and are also available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We\u2019ve also posted a slide presentation to accompany today\u2019s press release on our investor website.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen\u2019s strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period.","Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able.","Moving onto PharMEDium, at this point last year we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engage a new CGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business\u2019 new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered distribute phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders.","Over the posture, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. Given these factors, we made the difficult decision to shutdown and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication and we are appreciative of their efforts.","As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We\u2019re also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers, but believe exiting the business is appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details including the decisions impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call.","Turning now to our first quarter results, AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical strength and strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company\u2019s core strengths and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions, continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I\u2019m proud to work alongside our teams, who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers and the patients they serve.","Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment success reflects its continued focus on customer experience in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology.","In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. As the market leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting analytics and business practice solutions, they need to run their practices more efficiency and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. for increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislators and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients.","AmerisourceBergen\u2019s market leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We\u2019ve aligned ourselves with key customers and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. These elements combine with our scale efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network, and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities.","AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen\u2019s operating income. Our largest business in the segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience, while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence to therapy.","For example, extended health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products, while the Lash Group\u2019s technology enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay \u2013 start and stay on therapy.","Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is the ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatments like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivers unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services.","For example, World Courier\u2019s Cocoon offering is the industry\u2019s most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier\u2019s Nova technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers.","Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in-home clinical trials, making treatments in patients\u2019 home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I\u2019m proud of AmerisourceBergen\u2019s role as the global healthcare solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product.","Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of healthcare and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients, while saving lives and the healthcare systems, hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Adherence should be the goal for which all healthcare stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and raising out of pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the healthcare system.","As a leader in the healthcare supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained and long-term value. Execution of our four key strategic pillars; strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions, and proven corporate stewardship positions us well to benefit from market trends within an evolving market landscape.","As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve.","Thank you again for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?","Jim Cleary","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release.","As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group. Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31st and the January strategic decision to exit the business.","First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium, We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculate the fair value of PharMEDium\u2019s long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31 and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million.","Second, I\u2019ll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit as a compounding business. And as a result, we\u2019ll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges including PharMEDium\u2019s decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility.","In addition to the December quarter impairment charge. As a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter.","Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate, but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows and the years in which the benefit is realized. As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes.","Turning now through our first quarter results, I\u2019ll provide commentary in two main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen\u2019s businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2020. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS $1.76, an increase of 10% primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share counts. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple pennies.","Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5% driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison than the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously.","First, we had not yet left the healthcare benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better than expected expense management across the business in the quarter most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment. Consolidated operating income was $495 million up 5% with our operating margin down one basis point.","As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison healthcare and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses with the exception of PharMEDium are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through and our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January PharMEDium adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results.","The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line at certain built-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and therefore operating income. In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance.","Moving now to income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 21% up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete state income tax item. Our diluted share counts decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders, while on the topic of returning capital to shareholders this morning we also announced that the company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%.","AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment and as evidenced by share repurchases and dividends increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance.","Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash.","This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution services, segment revenue was $46 billion up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution of specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team\u2019s ability to execute and deliver value for our partners both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group.","As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter, as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.","I will now turn to the other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI in double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. The group is off to a solid start and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year.","The Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation and we are investing to fortify our strength in overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at Lash and NOVA at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and it\u2019s focused on execution to further enhance efficiency.","This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance.","As we said in this morning\u2019s press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80 which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company\u2019s continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase.","Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid-single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.","As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million $9 million and $18 million respectively. In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1 $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in a fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year.","Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share purchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding.","Lastly, while we did not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in-line with our original expectations for the year. Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020.","In closing regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you\u2019ve been on is no longer appropriate, and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged.","We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the question. I guess just to focus on the pharma segment guidance change and PharMEDium, I guess, Steve first, maybe could you talk a little bit about whether or not there was a sale process around PharMEDium, any discussions maybe with the FDA about the ramifications or potential ramifications from exiting this business just on thinking about the largest compounding pharmacy business out there?","And then you gave a lot of detail Jim around the change in the pharma segment guidance as far as the impact in the quarter and the balance of the year from PharMEDium. I guess maybe just to take a step back, did any of your other assumptions change outside of the PharMEDium math you provided as far as thinking about 2Q through 4Q?","Steve Collis","Yes, Bob, I\u2019ll start with the PharMEDium question. Obviously a disappointing day for ABC, but I think that Jim\u2019s script was excellent. And by the way, I apologize to everyone. I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope and we\u2019ll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim\u2019s comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we\u2019ve displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it\u2019s just that I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we\u2019ve continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we\u2019ve put in place.","We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so, we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of I think perseverance with this business. And I think that we\u2019ve reached this decision and we think that given \u2013 where the business is it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA. Throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation, we think that we\u2019ve approached this as a good stakeholder. We certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we will work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure.","Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?","Jim Cleary","Yes, sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding had to do with guidance impact in other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I\u2019ve said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4.","And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well and we are seeing really good performance in the core pharma distribution business. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution. In particular, our specialty physician services business, we\u2019re seeing good volume growth in the pharma distribution business. We\u2019re seeing 5% volume growth that\u2019s due to of course our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that\u2019s happening on our full year guidance. And of course it relates to our pharma distribution business you asked about, but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health business, which at 10% revenue growth in the quarter. And so that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob.","Robert Jones","Great. Appreciate all the comments.","Operator","The next question will come from Eric Percher of Nephron Research.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Continuing with PharMEDium, I know over the last two years it\u2019s been pretty clear that hospitals don\u2019t particularly want to be in this business. And at one point this was an effort to expand the hospital relationship. As you shutter it, do you see any impact on the other business that you have focused on the hospital and particularly with respect to the specialty business, how do you help ensure that those relationships don\u2019t sour and impact specialty?","Steve Collis","Yes. Hi, Eric. Obviously, of course, we thought about associates and our customers, and we \u2013 unfortunately since the closure of Memphis, we\u2019ve never really been able to deliver the consistent customer experience that an AmerisourceBergen company would like to have. And there\u2019s a lot of reasons for it. And in the six years since the passage of the 503B legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high CGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were by far the largest. So I think, having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us.","And I think we really along with some talented associates, dedicated associates, and some new leadership team, and some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 we do \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It\u2019s hard to read scale. And there\u2019s tremendous consequences if something doesn\u2019t go \u2013 if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations too.","So for ABC, which we have our purpose, we have our stakeholder value set. We just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding, I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with economics in the overall health system. And again, we don\u2019t want to be in a business where we can\u2019t provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that\u2019s about all we can say there.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Steve, how are you thinking about IPI pricing? Clearly, specialty is a sweet spot for ABC, but there\u2019s a lot of talk about changes around reimbursement, and I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that. Do you think anything will change here in your fiscal 2020? What are your conversations with the actual providers in the marketplace that a community-based physician? Just any color you can help us to understand how you\u2019re thinking about this would be helpful.","Steve Collis","I\u2019d say this is a number two concern in specialty. Our number one concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they\u2019re large, they\u2019re sophisticated. And I think that there\u2019ll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you\u2019d see some changes, you\u2019ve seen very moderate inflation.","In fact, on the Part B products, there\u2019s always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement. So if there is international reference pricing as we discussed in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it\u2019ll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes people tend to say pickup prices and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren\u2019t always recognized. And one thing as well, with governments and single payer systems, the price gets negotiated up front and then there\u2019s no changes. So that\u2019s one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system.","So, complex topic, you can hear that even at the CFO level, I\u2019m very engaged in this, very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs officers today. We\u2019re talking about it. Barry Fortner, who heads up our Physician Services business, is in Washington. Constantly, our business ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion and we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement.","Lisa Gill","Is it still anticipated that there\u2019ll be under some kind of competitive acquisition program? And so if that\u2019s the case, do you see maybe potential incremental opportunity for ABC? So I understand what you\u2019re saying around, the pricing dynamic is already starting to change. And so, maybe we don\u2019t see a huge impact to pricing, but is there a potential for you to either gain or potentially lose some amount of market share around a competitive acquisition program?","Steve Collis","I feel like we\u2019re going back to the 90s with the Medicare modernization. At the time, I think there was great anticipation that ABC with our suite of businesses, we would participate, and actually it was in 2000s, of course, the Bush administration. And there was no economically feasible way for us to participate. And I tell you, we brought in people especially to evaluate being a cap provider, mainly to ensure that our customers would be able to carry on participating. And it was just \u2013 it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don\u2019t believe it\u2019s very efficient. We\u2019ve seen so called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven\u2019t worked. And the original cap program didn\u2019t work.","So there\u2019s potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation the infusions. And we will carry on assisting with that. If it were to be a new top of the reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large much more aggregated community oncologists. We would look to work with them to provide solutions to payers and regulators.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Glen Santangelo of Guggenheim.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks for the questions. Jim, I just want to follow-up on the guidance question. I appreciate all the detail. You seem to suggest that over the next three quarters there\u2019ll be about a $35 million tailwind from eliminating the losses from PharMEDium, which I understand the EPS impact. But if we could just look at it from an operating income perspective, that $35 million seems to be about a 2% tailwind, which seems like it would fully explain the change in your guidance from low to mid single, up to mid single?","I\u2019m just trying to understand, is there \u2013 has anything changed with respect to your assumptions around the core distribution business because I just want to try to reconcile that versus the much stronger than expected first quarter, which seemed to incorporate a bigger than expected loss from PharMEDium. So if you could just sort of reconcile those, that\u2019d be great.","Jim Cleary","Yes. And so I will cover that. And you\u2019re right, we indicated that PharMEDium is a $35 million tailwind year-over-year versus last year. And so that\u2019s kind of the benefit that we\u2019ll see year-over-year compared to last year. And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last three quarters, it\u2019s about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range, so going from a low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we\u2019re also seeing strength throughout the businesses that\u2019s impacting our guidance increase also. And it\u2019s pretty broad based. We\u2019ve talked about specialty physician services, but we\u2019re seeing strength throughout the business.","One thing that I\u2019ll mention, as you talked about the first quarter, during the first quarter one thing we\u2019ve benefited from is low growth and operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don\u2019t expect to continue through the rest of the year. And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019, that we were still benefiting from year-over-year. And then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers, and so that\u2019s kind of one thing which benefited the first quarter which doesn\u2019t continue for the rest of the year.","And then we said, the second quarter, we\u2019re expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth to be at the lower end of 6% to 10% EPS growth range, because last year we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we aren\u2019t expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there Glen.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, that\u2019s all really helpful. And Steve, I just wanted to follow-up with you with 1 quick question on the balance sheet. As of this quarter, you have about $900 million in net debt. Based on your free cash flow assumptions, you\u2019re going to be cash \u2013 have positive cash on the balance sheet here in the next two to three quarters. And so I\u2019m just kind of wondering with PharMEDium now in the rearview mirror, has any \u2013 have your thoughts changed at all with respect to the balance sheet or capital deployment priorities? And how should we think about that going forward?","Steve Collis","No. We\u2019ve had a very consistent capital deployment strategy. I think last year, we returned in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks. And that\u2019s approximate numbers. And we like our financial flexibility. So our first option is to invest in the business. And we\u2019re bullish about projects like Fusion for example. And we talked about the strong growth of the World Courier, which in part is because of the Nova and the Cocoon investments. So those are good investment. And in couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business in investments. We remain interested in that. We are, of course, our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we are doing.","So that\u2019s the first priority. We then \u2013 we\u2019d look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been really a sellers market. And the quality of \u2013 I think if we found really the right asset and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position with right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support. I think we could be talking to paying a lot \u2013 significantly more than our multiple because we understand that, that\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s what\u2019s required in this market. But we really haven\u2019t seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It\u2019s about two years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion that worked out really, really well. There\u2019s not really opportunities on the regional side, so we just haven\u2019t seen a great opportunities.","I think where we interested is in the commercialization services, our expansion of the MWR business. That could be something we\u2019re very interested in. We\u2019ve made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things, and then of course we\u2019ll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend we announced this morning. So you\u2019ll continue see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense.","Glen Santangelo","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Charles Rhyee of Cowen.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Hey, thanks for taking a question. Steve, I think early on you talked about biosimilars and sort of the growth there. If you look at the data \u2013 if we look at the data last year, we did see a big starting to really see a big uptick in sort of adoption, particularly when you look at something like Neulasta or Neupogen. Are you \u2013 how much are you monitoring here sort of the shift to, particularly with the biosimilar insulin, is that an opportunity for you guys, because that looks like will be interchangeable. And then if you have any thoughts on \u2013 when you expect other biologics to become interchangeable and would that create a market for biosimilars that mimic more of the traditional generics market and perhaps bring more purchasing power back towards the supply chain side?","Steve Collis","Charles, thanks. Just in general though, the biosimilar numbers are encouraging. I think we talked about at the end of fiscal 2019, just how the growth exceed our expectations. But I would say that trend continues. The numbers are still small, but ABC has we think an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have in particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacies very well set up to play a role in. So definitely, we\u2019d be interested. I think one of the ways that I\u2019m really proud of ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have \u2013 I\u2019d say over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invest a lot of resources there.","We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think very competently and positioning as well for the long-term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we seeing and it\u2019s something that we monitor very, very closely and also staying close to as you would expect. We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years. So Thanks. Thanks for the question.","Operator","The next question will come from at Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So one guidance question and one just follow-up on PharMEDium. So on the PharMEDium side, if we think about PharMEDium from a pro forma basis, and we just kind of like exclude the losses that you incurred from them last year. What would be the pro forma EBIT growth for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment? So that\u2019s on them?","And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers? I noted last quarter we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna? Or anything else that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, maybe on the specialty side, that you can provide color on that drives the acceleration for the rest of the year.","Steve Collis","Yes. And so we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth across the business, seeing particularly strong growth in specialty distribution, but really broad-based growth in many parts of the business. We have called out the Cigna volume being added to express scripts, which is we indicated that, that is approximately 1\/4 of our revenue growth. And while it\u2019s inherently lower margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars. But we\u2019re seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we\u2019re seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business.","And then you asked about growth, if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we\u2019ve provided, Ricky really good detail on that in our prepared remarks that, that does the impact on PharMEDium. If we\u2019re looking year-over-year is $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year, in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss. And so if we look year-over-year, it is a $35 million tailwind to the business. But we are seeing excluding that good growth throughout our various businesses, in particular, our specialty distribution business, but throughout the business.","Operator","The next question will come from Steven Valiquette of Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning guys. So just a question on the financial hurdle on the sale versus the shutdown decision for PharMEDium. And I guess, in my mind, I feel like any asset that was arguably worth $2.6 billion in the marketplace only four years ago will still have some value today, maybe their in the hands of a private equity or another strategic buyer. So I\u2019m guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably net $0.","What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction? I\u2019m just trying to better understand what was the financial hurdle on the sale versus shutdown decision that was probably something well above $0. So I just want to understand that a little bit better.","Jim Cleary","We felt that the business was not saleable due to the ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, continued challenges to achieving the remediation timetable, which was extending and the continued financial burden of running the business. And so due to that, we made the decision to shut the business down. It\u2019s the most appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As you\u2019ve noted, we do have a cash tax benefit of $500 million to $600 million that we\u2019ll recognize between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2022. That will benefit our GAAP P&L. It will not benefit our adjusted P&L, but there will be a benefit to cash flow over that time period.","Operator","The next question will come from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","Good morning guys and I appreciate you taking the question. I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up kind of on the balance sheet outlook. And Steve or Jim, I guess, can you talk about whether or not you guys feel the need to kind of war chest cash in anticipation of an opioid settlement? Or do you guys feel like you have continued flexibility to put money to work in the opioid settlement that we \u2013 I guess, people expect to occur at some point is kind of in \u2013 on bucket, so to speak?","Steve Collis","No. As I\u2019ve said, our priorities for capital deployment are \u2013 I detailed them. We don\u2019t feel the need to war chest at all because if you look at the framework that was announced, it was an 18-year settlement. So I think that\u2019s in anticipation of the sort of long-term characteristics of the industry for not only us but our peers and our competitors as well. So that\u2019s \u2013 again, that the proposed framework, but that\u2019s the sort of framework that we\u2019d be interested in. So it\u2019s a sort of \u2013 have really played it out over the long term, which also has the benefit of providing consistent support for patient services that we think will be needed to transition population health management for this crisis. So in a way, if you want to call it that.","So no. It\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms. In relative terms, it\u2019s relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day in sales. It\u2019s not that much, and some of it is out the country. And it is a tremendous seasonality in our business as well. So we like being in a strong cash position. But again, we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that we make in the marketplace.","So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost nine years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity.","So \u2013 but I think it\u2019s incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged [Audio Gap] commercially, we have extremely strong customer relationships, partnerships and leadership in key markets and services. Culturally, we are a purpose-driven organization that feels you\u2019re not in our responsibility to create healthier futures. And AmerisourceBergen, I can assure you, is focused on creating long-term growth and value for all its stakeholders. And again, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. Have a good day. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara Brungess","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's December quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate & Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen. And joining me today are Steve Collis, President and CEO of AmerisourceBergen; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO of AmerisourceBergen.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations, including, without limitations, revenue, operating margin and taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. We remind you that there are many uncertainties and risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

Those connected by phone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our conference.","Steve Collis","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and I commend our associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel. ","Day in and day out they are focused on creating value for all of our stakeholders and ultimately for the patients we all serve. We play a vital role in the provision of healthcare which is grounded in our dedication to operational excellence, a continuous improvement in the efficiency, and our bold embrace of innovation. ","Everything we do is ultimately driven by one objective, enabling high quality pharmaceutical care for patients. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed in our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape healthcare delivery by providing creative solutions to the challenges inherent in today\u2019s healthcare market place.","The proficiency with which we run our business creates value for all of our stakeholders and enables us to strategically position ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are unfolding in a rapidly changing landscape. ","Tim will provide the details on our financial performance in the quarter, but I want to highlight a few items. Revenues were up 9% in the December quarter to $36.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.27, an impressive result considering the strong performance in the prior year. ","We are making good progress on our free cash flow objectives for the year, generating $661 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. In addition, we have continued to make strategic investments in our business in order to position ourselves well to meet the changing needs of our customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities. ","In November, we closed acquisition of PharMEDium, the premiere national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the US. Health systems are playing an increasingly important role in patient care and this acquisition represents a significant investment in our ability to provide market leading services and\/or solutions to this key customer segment. ","PharMEDium\u2019s proven ability to consistently deliver high quality CSPs in select therapeutic areas combined with the impressive track record of growth, makes them a compelling addition to ABDC. We are very pleased that PharMEDium new state-of-the-art facility in Dayton, New Jersey is now open and providing high quality sterile IV products to their customers. ","This new facility further enhances their capabilities and capacity and will be critical to supporting the future growth we expect in this business. The integration work with ABDC is going very well and PharMEDium is on track to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and to our health systems customers for many years to come. ","As we have previously discussed, in addition to making investments in our business, we have also kept our commitment to our shareholders and have virtually completely offset the expected impact of exercises of the warrants held by Walgreens Boots Alliance we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. ","While the only share repurchases in the December quarter were under the special program and related to warrant hedging, we did repurchase a $100 million under our normal share repurchases program in January. I\u2019m very proud of the financial stewardship we have demonstrated over the years and we remain disciplined in the deployment of capital.","We are fortunate to be part of a unique and very successful industry that is excelled by constantly working to take cost out of the healthcare system, while helping to ensure that patients have the widest possible access to the medications their physicians prescribe for them. The industry is competitive but stable in large parts, because we enjoy a solid level of organic market growth, but also because of participants in this industry are sophisticated enterprises that have made important investments in infrastructure and technology in order to continuously improve the most efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world. ","Today our expertise extends well beyond demand aggregation and logistics. We help enable pharmaceutical care, serving manufacturers as they strive to develop new products and get them to market, and healthcare providers as they focused on expertly improving patient outcomes while managing the cost of care. ","AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned within this industry to help support the entire life cycle of growth and to cheer patients who have access to both traditional and complex new therapies across all sides of care. We work with thousands of manufacturers and make daily deliveries to tens of thousands of customers efficiently turning inventory to maintain an order full rate of more than 99%.","We work effectively in highly regulated environment, maintain the flexibility to respond to emergencies on demand, and we do sell at an exceptionally low cost. In many cases, patients\u2019 lives are at stake and our associates never hesitate to credibly solve problems and meet whatever challenges might be in front of them. ","Let\u2019s turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a solid quarter with revenues up 5% driven in large part by solid organic volume growth offset by some previously announced lost business. ","Our retail chain, mail order and hospital customers all had strong revenue growth in the quarter. ABDC is however working with some top comparisons this year and generic inflation in particular is declining more than we had originally anticipated. As always we continue to remain focused on driving efficiency in operations without sacrificing the service we are able to provide our customers.","We also are committed to making investments in our business that will position us well to take advantage of future opportunities. These activities are critical to securing future growth. Just this week we began servicing over 900 public stores with a grand specialty product and some of the generic that they dispense in their food and drug combination stores. ","This is a great example of how we continue to support access to specialty products across all sides of care. One of the unique aspects of this distribution agreement is that Publix will utilize our RFID enabled Cubixx specialty drug inventory cabinets as they further deliver to develop their specialty pharmacy offerings. ","In addition, Publix will have access to the full breadth of our knowledge and expertise in this area, and we look forward to a long term collaborative relationship with this key growing food and drug retailer. ","In January, we signed an early renewal and a 9-year contract extension with our largest independent pharmacy group purchasing organization customer, Compliant Pharmacy Alliance or CPA. CPA is one of the most innovative groups of independent pharmacy owners and has become an important anchor of customer in our independent retail segment with 1225 member stores. ","Since we first began our relationship back in 2009, they\u2019ve nearly doubled the number of member stores. Their impressive growth, the high quality dealership they provide in independent pharmacy and the value they place upon our good neighbor pharmacy programs make them an exceptional long term partner. ","Both at CPA contract and the public contract further strengthen our high quality retail customer base and provide opportunity for future growth. We also are pleased with the performance in our health systems customers this quarter. Our acute care customers increasingly provide some of the most important touch points for patient care. These customers now represent one of the fastest growing segments we serve in ABDC and the investments we\u2019ve made in targeted programs and services for this channel is paying off. ","For example, both our progenerics programs and our private label generic programs BluePoint today itself has hospitals as well as retailers, and of course as I mentioned earlier, we closed the PharMEDium acquisition during the quarter and we have made excellent progress on the integration of this business.","I am very excited about what our health systems customers bring to ABC and we continue to explore ways to bring innovative new solutions to help it raise the challenges they face in a rapidly changing market. ","AmerisourceBergen specialty group again had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving revenues up 15%. Our community oncology business in particular had a strong quarter and our physician distribution businesses also had a good quarter. ","Our market leadership in specialties rooted in intimate knowledge of our customers and long and deep experience in the market place. The expertise we have in this area and the portfolio of services we have developed over many years extends well beyond specialty logistics.","We help manufacturers and healthcare providers manage the distinct requirement for specific disease stage and unique classes of products. Our collaborative approach in this area has been the foundation upon which we have established ourselves as the preferred partner for specialty products and services and gives us a firm footing in this most vibrant and dynamic area of the market place. ","In a market that is increasingly focused on the cost of care, the best way to discover and deliver value in the long run is to work in concert with our business partners. One of the ways we accomplish this is through our global supply and manufacture relations business units based in Bern, Switzerland also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. ","We have made important progress in the brand specialty generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of sophistication and coordination between manufacturers and our customers. ","In October, the Switzerland teams launched Certio a new portal that provides business insights and customized reporting for our generic manufacturer partners. Certio offers real time access to AmericasourceBergen sales data as well as inventory management and sales forecasting tools.","The Swiss based platform also offers a flexibility to schedule and receive customized reports based on the manufacturers business needs. Certio\u2019s value is evidenced by its rapid adoption and usage, with virtually all of our generic manufacture partners accessing the system.","Looking ahead we continue to review the possibility to expand a better report and data for manufacturers, helping them make more informed decisions and supporting their efforts to improve supply chain efficiency for their products. ","Lets\u2019 turn now to the other segment, this segment continues to benefit from the inclusion of MWI in our results and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and a few investments to help them continue to meet their long term objectives. ","The companion animal business was especially strong in the December quarter as MWI benefitted from strong organic growth, new product introductions and healthy pricing environment and some new business wins. ","We are very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016 and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to pharmaceutical supply channels, as we continue to grow our presence in the complex animal health segment.","Just this week I attended the MWI National Sales Conference in Orlando, and I was reminded again of the strong culture at MWI, the excellent fit with ABC, and a significant industry presence that MWI has in animal health which is exemplified by their demand generating sales force. ","Our manufacture services businesses also had a solid December quarter with Lash Group in particular performing very well as they grew their business for key manufacture customers. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. ","Our increasingly global reach in this area further expands our value proposition to manufacturers. We continuously seek out ways to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high value pharmaceutical products whether through World Courier in the clinical trial base or through our consulting business in the commercialization phases.","When we compound these unique capabilities with the other programs and services ABC offers, we are increasingly able to effectively support product launch in most of the developed world. ","As I\u2019ve said many times before, it is the great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. We are well positioned in all of our customer segments and we are proud to service flagship customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance with a pharmaceutical they need to meet the needs of their patients on a daily basis. ","While we face headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, we are well positioned to deliver 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the year following two consecutive years in which delivered growth over 20%.","Tim will provide the details on our revised guidance, and while I\u2019m disappointed that we no longer believe we can achieve the high-end of our regional EPS guidance range for fiscal 2016, we remain on track to deliver strong revenue growth and substantial free cash flow over the course of the year. ","We would of course remain laser focused on being as efficient as we can possibly be, while providing the level of services our customers expect. Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate that our value creation is a result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon on which our performance is built. ","While fiscal 2016 has been somewhat more challenging than we first expected. I have confidence because our associate share my conviction that doing thing efficiently and being a dynamic channel partner with a view to the future is what sets ABC apart. ","Our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, and our thoughtful capital management, all help us grow our business in ways that will help ensure we generate long term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come. ","Now here\u2019s Tim","Tim Guttman","Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Consistent with past quarters my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter ended December 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. ","As a reminder, Steve highlighted that we closed PharMEDium in early November and the results are now included in our pharmaceutical distribution segment. I have two main topics to cover this morning. First I\u2019ll recap our fiscal Q1 consolidated and segment performance and second I will cover our revised fiscal \u201916 expectations. ","With that we can begin our Q1 review; revenues were 36.7 billion up just over 9%, our pharmaceutical distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. On a comparable basis, the last year which means excluding MWI which is in our other segment, our ABC consolidate revenue growth would have been just under 7%.","The quarters adjusted gross profit increased 18% to 1.54 billion, the majority of the dollar growth was due to the two acquisitions that we\u2019ve made most notably MWI. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year in the December 2014 quarter, we had especially strong contributions from generic price appreciation and we are still cycling through the repricing of the Department of Defense contract renewal.","We anticipated these headwinds and we previously called them out. Operating expenses, our total adjusted OPEX increased 26% to 579 million, roughly 75% of the increase is related to our two acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Excluding the incremental OPEX impact from these two companies our comparable OPEX growth rate would have been in the mid-single digits. ","Operating income; our adjusted operating income was 475 million, up about 40 million or 9%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down one basis points from the prior year, driven mostly by the pharmaceutical distribution segment being down 10 basis points this quarter.","Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about 29 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing cost for MWI and PharMEDium. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 34.6% for the current quarter, down from the prior year.","We continue to realize a higher percentage of our income from our international businesses which includes World Courier, our Ireland BluePoint private label company and our ABC Switzerland company.,","As Steve mentioned, we continue to expand our service offerings to manufacturers from Switzerland including the very successful launch of Certio, a market leading data portal. Looking ahead, as we continue to expand our international service offering and formally implement an ongoing R&D tax credit program, we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 33.5%.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.27, driven mostly from the contributions of our acquisitions, our adjusted diluted share count was about 230 million shares roughly flat to last year. ","This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let\u2019s move forward and discuss our segment results starting with pharmaceutical distribution. Total segment revenues were 35.2 billion, up nearly 7%, and as mentioned earlier by Steve our Drug Company had a growth rate of over 5%, a solid growth across key customer segments including independent, chain and alternate site.","Contributor to this growth includes overall market growth, the launch of new innovative drugs like the Hepatitis C drugs and a continued good brand pricing environment. I should point out that the Drug Company did have a slight revenue headwind this quarter of about 1.5% due to two previously announced customer losses.","Our Specialty Business Group had an overall revenue increase of 15%, driven primarily by unit volume growth. This is the 7th consecutive quarter that our Specialty Group has grown top line revenues at 10% or above. ","Looking at it from a disease state standpoint, we had meaningful revenue growth in oncology across a few of our specialty businesses and also ophthalmology. Overall we are very pleased with the continued performance of this key business group that helps to differentiate ABC.","Moving to gross profit, the segments gross profit was 772 million, up about 20 million or about 3%. The growth in gross profit dollars was about evenly split between our two businesses, Drug Company and the Specialty Group. Drug Company excluding the benefit from PharMEDium was behind last year\u2019s gross profit due to the two large headwinds I called out previously, the tough comparison engineered price inflation and the Department of Defense contract repricing. ","Segment operating income was 380 million and was down 3%, our Specialty Business continued with a high level of performance offset by lower performance by our Drug Company, due to the gross profit items I just called out. ","Wrapping up, even though it was a partial quarter for PharMEDium, this business is growing revenues and contributing operating income right in line with what we\u2019d expected, so a very positive start.","We can now move to our other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the December quarter, segment revenues were about 1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI revenue growth would have been as a percentage in the high-single digits.","Let me cover our last consulting business first, they had a very good quarter as a result of new and expanded support services, two existing manufacture customers. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well. This is our third full quarter of owning MWI, and we are extremely pleased with the integration and progress made to date. ","The management team is laser focused on servicing their customers and growing the business. On a comparable basis, MWI grew as companion revenues as a percentage in the mid-teens, we continue to see an expanding US animal health market, driven by organic growth, new innovative products, and a healthy drug pricing environment. ","From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of nearly 96 million. MWI contributed the majority of the increase, since we haven\u2019t anniversaried the acquisition yet for consulting also help to drive the exceptional result in this segment. ","Let me point out that the operating margin is down some in this segment as MWI has a lower overall margin compared to our two other businesses, so overall mix of causing compression in the margin percentage. ","This completes our segment review and let me switch and quickly cover our two large GAAP items, warrant and LIFO. Warrants have highlighted in the 8-K that we filed on November 23, we received a favorable IRS private letter ruling on the deductibility of the fair market value of the warrant upon exercise. ","Our GAAP tax rate in this quarters\u2019 financial results, now reflect the applicable tax accounting as a result of the ruling. Switching to our tax deduction, our deduction will be at a fair market value or the intrinsic value of the respective warrants at the time of exercise. ","Our cash tax benefit is essentially our effective tax rate multiplied by the tax deduction amount. It may take several quarters to actually monetize the deduction, because we\u2019ll have to change our quarterly estimated tax payments and also potentially file for refunds. ","LIFO, this quarter we recorded an expense of just over 100 million which represent about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year fiscal \u201916 expense is expected to be less than the prior year due primarily to a slightly lower projected brand inflation rate. ","This wraps up our P&L review, I\u2019d like to cover key working capital and cash flow items. In the December quarter we had solid free cash flow of 661 million. We continue to manage our working capital metrics closely. DSO and a number of days in inventory both remain relatively unchanged even with our large top line growth. ","We ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet, with a relatively small percentage of this amount offshore. ","The next area I\u2019d like to cover is share buyback and also our warrant hedging coverage. In October we purchased 1.3 million shares for 119 million under special share authorization to complete our previously announced March 2015 call option hedging strategy. These were the only shares purchased in the quarter. ","We highlighted on our year-end call that we limit our regular share repurchases as a result of the additional borrowings to partially fund the PharMEDium acquisitions. As noted in our press release table and as we\u2019ve said in the past, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise based on the ABC closing share price at December 31, 2015.","This means we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens mostly likely in March 2016. ","Now lets\u2019 turn to our revised fiscal \u201916 expectations, I will provide guidance comments in a few key areas. Revenues we continue to guide the ABC consolidated revenue growth in the 8% to10% range for the full year which included the new publics account, operating income. ","Let me cover three items that are now impacting our full year operating income and margin. First generic inflation trends, previously our fiscal \u201916 guidance factored in moderating generic price appreciation and consequently for ABC to translate it to a lower dollar level of contribution versus fiscal \u201915. ","Now that we are starting our 5th month of our current fiscal year, we\u2019d had a longer period to evaluate generic pricing trends. We thought that we see some increased activity in January like we did last year, but it\u2019s still been especially slow. ","Based on this, our assumption around generic price appreciation has been updated. We now believe that generic inflation will be quite modest during the remaining three quarters of our fiscal year. ","The second item we are also forecasting our contributions from new generic drugs will be less than expected. This includes the ALOXI an infused oncology drugs that we previously expected to convert to generic, however based on a recent court ruling, the generic launch has now been delayed a couple of years.","And the third item that\u2019s highlighted by Steve, we recently signed a new strategic long term contract with CPA, an anchor customer to our independent retail segment. We made a proactive decision to renew roughly one year early, so that we can start enhanced programs and initiatives with them to drive incremental business over the long term. ","To summarize, two of the items that I covered above, our full year fiscal \u201916 operating income growth has slowed as a result we now expect that our operating margins will increase 3 to 5 basis points down from the previous guidance of an increase of 8 to 12 basis points.","Adjusted EPS, we now expected fiscal \u201916 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.83, which still reflects strong growth of 15% and 18% for the last years adjusted EPS. Free cash flow, our guidance that we previously provided, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion remains unchanged since we are still early in our fiscal year.","As I wrap up I\u2019d like to add that we did purchase approximately $100 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program in January. But a continued top priority for ABC is to reduce the portion of the debt associated with our recent acquisitions. ","However as always, this is subject to reviewing our cash flow, market conditions and other competing capital needs. So in summary, a solid quarter and start to the year, however we\u2019ll be working through the impact of two incremental headwinds this fiscal year that weren\u2019t previously accepted along with renewing an anchored customer to a unique 9 year contract. ","As always we continue to drive efficiencies in our business while delivering value to all of our customers, we remain committed to growing our adjusted EPS in a meaningful way in fiscal \u201916 by focusing on what we do best, servicing our customers, deploying capital appropriately and making the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. ","As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here\u2019s Barbara to start on the Q&A","Barbara Brungess","We will now open the call for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many callers as possible. Please go ahead Lisa.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Despite all of the comments and focus, I think there\u2019s still a good amount of confusion in the marketplace related to generic pricing and the impact on wholesaler economics. Just two-part question, one would be, how comfortable are you today that what you are factoring in now contemplates a true downside scenario for generic pricing? ","The second part would be, it would be helpful to just level set for everyone, why if we are in fact returning to a more normalized deflationary environment. How does that not create a more significant drag on profitability?","Steve Collis","Of course at recent conference that we\u2019ve discussed this a lot, I would say that ABC\u2019s approach as we\u2019ve been saying, we always knew we didn\u2019t have perfect information about generic cost increases and we did factor it in. Of course we like to have strived for high performance, so it was something that we had to take in to account. ","But we knew always that it was somewhat unpredictable, we don\u2019t have perfect information. So I would just say that ABC and our industry has proved to be very resilient. It\u2019s scrappy, we\u2019ve gone through a change, [depleted] service, had a huge patent exploration that we\u2019ve experienced in the past few years. We\u2019ve had some specific events in specialty like (inaudible) Platin and we\u2019ve cross spinning both inflationary and deflationary comps. ","So our manufacture contracts will take us on the downside for deflation and the key to us is always increasing volume and to help the right scale, and that\u2019s where I think to [weave] that Alliance is so powerful. We entered in to that before we started experiencing significant inflation because we felt like being global, we felt like really going in to partnership with the largest retailer was the right way to make sure that we always had competitive pricing on generics and profitable environment, whatever we saw in the market. ","So, I think we\u2019ve made a lot of smart moves, and I would just say that we are confident we could make in a deflation environment and we have historically as well. ","Tim Guttman","And Bob let just add to Steve in terms of the first part of your question was, we are very comfortable with our range now, we\u2019ve taken the risk out. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we put in we think generic inflation would quite modest. So we definitely took the risk out of the range and we think it\u2019s quite achievable. If it turns against us for the balance of the year, than we still feel confident we\u2019ll stand erect. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Got it, and just the second question related to that but maybe taking a step back, if we look at the core growth for the Drug Company, if we back out a couple of months for PharMEDium, it looks like EBIT margins were down maybe in the 15 basis point range. ","If we are in a more normalized maybe deflationary generic environment, you mentioned maybe fewer generic launches, how should we think about the growth profile, the profit growth profile for that business going forward?","Steve Collis","We always thought about the Drug Company as the engine, and I would point to the fact that we\u2019ve got a couple of outstanding customers notably WBA. I think the CPA contract renewal a really key one for us with a nine year contract, that\u2019s a tremendous expression of confidence not only ABC but in our offering around independent pharmacy. ","So we think that we\u2019ve got a great business of the Drug Company. It definitely is mature and a lot of our customers are mature and we\u2019ll be helped a lot by our new drug innovations. We saw Sovaldi was a real great and all the Hep C clash was great for us. We\u2019ve got the new (inaudible), so it\u2019s a lot of new opportunities and we expect at some stage we\u2019re going to start seeing our 2017 plan, we haven\u2019t started yet but I can tell you that when Tim and I meet with Bob Mauch, the President of the Drug Company in [\u201816], we\u2019re going to be expecting good growth next year on operating margins. So maybe that\u2019s the best way I can answer. Tim anything to add?","Tim Guttman","I would just add that we want to pick relationships and our customers carefully. We want customers that grow faster than market. That\u2019s why we get these long term contracts with CPA, so it\u2019s all about growing. It\u2019s all about growing your generic volume base and controlling and making sure you capture the entire wallet from that customer. ","I think we\u2019ve done a good job at aligning ourselves with these types of customers and that also including in all of our segments. So we\u2019re still very bullish on the Drug Company and it comes down to generic revenues and like I said making sure that you capture all of their purchases.","Barbara Brungess ","Thanks Bob, next question please. ","Operator","That comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Just looking at the rest of fiscal \u201916 and thinking about the magnitude of the impact of the three variables you were calling out. Obviously you have taxes as the good guy, but on the other side you have the generic pricing changes, the customer contract renewal pricing, and then you also mentioned the lowering set of profits from the new generics. ","Is there anyway just to rank order the magnitude of those, just to give us a little more color for which ones are more critical versus less critical? I am sure we have a sense, but just any additional color would be helpful. ","Tim Guttman","I\u2019ll jump in Steve and I would say that we felt they are all significant to call out. Looking at each one individually along with the tax benefit, they weren\u2019t probably significant to drop our range but collectively all three together was why we had dropped the range. I think that\u2019s the best way to answer the question.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","The other real quick one just on the quarterly chronology, I'm not sure how granular you want to get on this. But it does seem like the March quarter, in particular could be a pretty tough comp on the generic pricing, but then it does seem to get a little bit easier after that based on our data. So I am curious if you guys share that view or is it may be too early to draw that conclusion at this stage?","Tim Guttman","I would say looking out for the balance of the year the next three quarters, the second half of June and September, probably June get a little bit better for us. We do have an easier comp in the second half for two reasons, one, that generic inflation is a better comp and also we start the [last] DOD. So well these two items won\u2019t make the drug company a better, a stronger second half, along with a good launch of one of the generics this year in the second half that we\u2019ve talked about previously that\u2019s still on schedule to launch. ","Barbara Brungess","Next question please. ","Operator","That comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup ","On moderating generic inflation, could you give us a sense of how conservative your current assumptions are now versus before? So if things continue to deteriorate further, how much more room is there to fall before getting to zero contribution to earnings for the year or is it contemplated in the current guidance?","Steve Collis","Yeah, again I\u2019ll go back to that comment, obviously we\u2019re very considerate of that comment. We just don\u2019t have perfect information. We were surprised in a couple of quarters at the strength of generic inflation and we\u2019ve been surprised at how quickly we didn\u2019t see inflation in the last couple of months, and you\u2019ve seen various comments on it. ","So you could make an argument that we\u2019d be conservative for the next couple of quarters through the end of fiscal \u201916. But again we don\u2019t have perfect information and we\u2019re calling it like we see it right now, and if there was to be an assumption and there are a lot of industry factors for example the big acquisitions activity that\u2019s going on. ","So things could change and we\u2019ll be back, but we made a commitment that one of your competitor conference that as soon as we understood all the trends in January and we collided all of our data that we\u2019d be a transparent as we can be, and I think we\u2019ve looked up to that commitment very well. ","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup ","And then Tim I think you touched on this in your prepared remarks. But in terms of your renewal with CPA, could you elaborate a little bit more as to what drove it to be renewed early? I think as Steve had mentioned that the competitive landscape remains still, so wondering how these types of deals get renewed.","Tim Guttman","The competitive landscape is competitive, but I think those big customers really do like to stay with us. What was important as for CPA, right as [Bob] became President of the Drug Company we took over this account. We\u2019ve had a relationship with them, where we\u2019ve seen them experience tremendous growth. ","We\u2019ve obviously seen a tightening of networks etcetera in independent pharmacy and we\u2019ve seen a real desire on ABC\u2019s account to expand the level of services that what we call the next generation of good neighbor pharmacy services. So when you look at over 1200 independent members that CPA has and you look at our need for anchored customers which we have that theme throughout ABC. ","We have it for example with Florida Cancer, we have it with of course WBA. We have it in dialysis with the DaVita and Fresenius folks. So we have a lot of these just tremendous accounts. So we wanted to really get CPA to quote them to unpack their bags, to acclimatize for the long-term so we could work on the planning that is so vital to the strength and hard work and collaboration that we have with many key customers. ","So that\u2019s what this is about and we think that we made the right long term move for our customers and you\u2019ll find ABC unapologetically always been focused on driving the long term value for our customers and this nine year is emblematic of that. ","Barbara Brungess","Next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley ","Steve if we just think about all the different moving parts and assuming the generic inflation is just going to be more normalized longer-term and the generic product line is what it is and the mix of the product coming generics being a little bit more complex, which might mean that we are not going to see the direct correlation of patent expirations and generic launches that we've seen in the past. ","So when you step back and you think about the future, what do you think is the sustainable growth profile for the core drug distribution business from topline and EBIT perspective? ","Steve Collis","We first always thought in our industry that\u2019s growing and we could go off script data but we have a way to sort of aggregate IMS data. You look at a pretty good picture with brand introductions and also the customer profile that we have those anchor customers that I talked about and many other customers that are so important to overall growth. ","And then you also look at our specialty credit business and especially market share. So we feel excited about the future, and we have a lot of other levels that we continue to pull around operating excellence, more analysis, better long term contracting with more information. ","We have expense efficiency that we continue to be very thoughtful about, and then of course that thoughtful capital deployment which I think almost everyone would give us high marks on, whether it\u2019s the right dividend policy or the right share repurchases, the right internal investments which we\u2019ve made, many of which are so critical to our growth.","We talked about one here in AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, but there\u2019s lots of example of those really strategic internal investments we\u2019ve made which are hearty among the best ROIC that we get on any investment. So I\u2019d say, I\u2019m excited about the future, I think we\u2019ve got good prospects, and I would remind you that again we\u2019re talking about in 2016 15% to 18% growth of two years or 20% plus.","So how many companies that have a revenue growth rate of approximately 150 billion aren\u2019t doing that. So again this is a great industry and I think the outlook for us really highlights that. ","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley ","So two thoughts on this, for the top line I think distribution grew at about 7% this quarter on an organic basis. Do you think that is a reasonable growth rate for us to think about going forward? And if so like a 7% topline growth and assuming the opportunities for further efficiencies, should we think about EBIT growth at the 9% level so that\u2019s one thought? ","The second one, you highlighted capital deployment and obviously the cash flows are above industry standard and continue to be very strong. So can you just walk us through just the sustainability of that longer-term to continue to generate these cash flows when you think about customer mix and the product dynamics?","Tim Guttman","Yeah Ricky its Tim, I\u2019ll take the first one which is the revenue. I\u2019ll echo what Steve said, we have a very strong portfolio of customers and I would say that our revenue should grow above market, that\u2019s our working thesis that we selected past growers and whatever IMS is, whatever the market is showing we should be above that and when you add in specialty that\u2019s also, I would recall an enhancer to our revenue growth. ","So again high to above market growth. EBIT I think it\u2019s too early, we are not ready to really comment on EBIT. We\u2019ll provide more color as we move through the year and talk about that as we go. ","Steve Collis","And you know the cash flow I think ABC is always targeting to have a higher cash flow than our net earnings. And you\u2019ll know that we\u2019re working on some things with our changing tax rate. So it\u2019s still our goal. Absent any big changes in customer, a significant customer or supply terms there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t bear to carry on generating that sort of capital efficiency that we\u2019ve guided for 2016. I wouldn\u2019t go off 2015, I\u2019d go more of 2016, that\u2019s the better range for you to bake any models on, back on to 2015 which had some one-time benefits for us. ","Barbara Brungess","Next question please. ","Operator","That comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Just to follow up on a few things. First off, Tim, I think you talked about the IRS ruling around the warrants as impacting your tax rate going forward. So how do we think about that? You offset or excluded all the other warrant kind of expenses, but we will see the benefit in the actual income statement that you are reporting on a GAAP basis, as well as at a reported basis?","Tim Guttman","Good question Lisa and just to clarify, so we did see a tax rate change benefit on our GAAP tax rate this quarter and our GAAP financial, but we\u2019ve always excluded that from our adjusted. So there\u2019s no change on the adjusted tax rate, only on a GAAP standpoint. I think that should answer your question.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Okay, that helps. But will it be accounted the same way going forward, as you talked about some of the rulings that are going to impact tax rate on a go-forward basis?","Steve Collis","Well there won\u2019t be a difference going forward in terms of our GAAP and our adjusted rate. Now we\u2019re synchronized because of that. The benefit really from the ruling is we\u2019ll get a cash tax benefit upon exercise that will take several quarters to monetize. ","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Okay. And then, Steve, I just wanted to go back to your most recent comment that 2015 is somewhat of a difficult comparison. But if I look at the revenue growth, for example, on this quarter 9.3%, and adjusted EBIT growing 9.1%, I think what people are trying to get at or trying to understand is the leverage to the business model. ","And keeping in mind that there were some unusual opportunities around generic price inflation and some other things that have gone on as you talked about in fiscal 2015. But can you maybe just help us to think about this business model in general, and what are some of the drivers to the leverage of a model off of that revenue number? ","And then secondly just to understand some of the acquisitions that you have made recently for example like PharMEDium and the impact that they can have, because as we just think about their revision to the EBIT growth rate or the margin expansion. ","I think we are just trying to work through the different impacts, how much that potentially is generic drug price inflation versus repricing and the benefit of some of these higher-margin businesses that you bought? So any incremental color around that I think would just be really helpful. ","Steve Collis","I think PharMEDium is very new and you have a good idea if you go back to what we said at the time. It\u2019s performing very well, as is MWI. MWI of course is in a similar sort of industry from a competitive perspective as we are where they have some strong competitors that we compete against, but I think we are well positioned. ","I was at their sales meeting as I said on the call, so they are really performing on expectations, and particularly have done because of some economic circumstances, the companion animal business has actually done especially well and again we keep on adding new services there. ","PharMEDium, we just really two months that we reported in May closing and early November. We\u2019re happy we\u2019ve made a few changes. We haven\u2019t had surprises, we of course are very mindful of the regulatory environment and trying to go to where the pack is going and make sure we are ahead of regulators but it\u2019s a business that we drill to own. ","The response from customers has been good, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s going to take long for the three to be really any synergy on the business development side with PharMEDium and our health systems business. But an edge to the overall discussion level that edged out strategic relevance. So we like the acquisition, ","I will tell you that the growth profile in this business especially the way that they can just do more business with the current customers or not, we are almost full penetrated, we do all the needs for our health system customers. On the prescription side this is a whole new way for them to grow as they keep on adding new therapies to their offerings as the customers get to like their service. So we are really pleased by that. ","Getting back to your questions as far as the growth rate, you will see, we\u2019ve had a lot of investment because of WBA and the real number of SKUs that we\u2019re distributing through our business has really increased significantly and we\u2019ve really caught up with that investment now. We would hope to continue investing in the network, making sure it\u2019s both updated efficient and we do expect our total customers to carry on growing.","So the [amount] is very leveragble and I think you can look at the long history we\u2019ve had of trading efficiency, so I would say it is leveragable and we\u2019ve just had some occurrences here with not having a strong generic launch period in this quarter and probably the march quarter, and also the inflation that we talked about as well as some tough comps on the DOD and the renewal on CPA which I could tell you we\u2019ve done for all the right reasons. So that - Tim had something to add as well. ","Tim Guttman","I\u2019ll just say Lisa that PharMEDium probably added a few basis points to this segment this quarter because again as Steve mentioned two months and they are certainly a higher margin profile company. And second, I just want to go back to your tax questions just to confirm. When we gave new guidance on our revised tax rate that clearly not related to the IRS private letter ruling.","The change in our tax rate is related to international mix been very plentiful and thoughtful of our growing international business, seeing the tax rate come down because of that and also we\u2019re implementing a formal R&D tax rate credit program related to technology. So those are drivers of the adjusted tax rate not the IRS private ruling just wanted to confirm that. ","Barbara Brungess","Next question please.","Operator","That comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. ","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Just want to touch on this concept when we are talking about generic inflation and obviously that is moderating. But when we talk about deflation for generic drugs, my assumption has always been that deflation occurs either when the drug goes from brand to generics, you have a big step downs in pricing. ","And then when more manufacturers come into a market, more generic manufacturers come into the market and the pricing falls further after sort of an exclusivity period. Are there situations though when let's say there are a constant number of manufacturers for a generic drug where prices would then again start falling?","Steve Collis","I don\u2019t think you\u2019re talking about rapid decreases I think you\u2019re talking about contract renewal process or market conditions or as you said a new entrant in to the market. But this is something we\u2019ve experienced for a long time. It\u2019s a robust market, there are new entrance from India and China they\u2019re coming to the market. But I think again, most of the generic manufacturers that we work with are multinational companies that are holding to shareholders and have got commitments to shareholders and are going to be responsible about the long term positioning.","So we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s really in a historical context irrational or truly surprising. Again we don\u2019t have perfect information on and we did talk about especially the third and fourth quarter last year as well as the first quarter. We had some really strong comp. So sorry we saw it moderating in the third and fourth quarter, the first two quarter last year we saw a very strong cost inflation which surprised us. ","And we pointed that out on all of our calls. Tim any more details. ","Tim Guttman","I would just say that the last few years if we - we always talk about our generic baskets of portfolio drug has been on the market for over a year. When we saw inflation the inflation was in the low-single digits. Now that we\u2019re seeing some deflation that is probably deflating in the low-single digits. So we\u2019re not talking like extreme movement either way.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Okay, that is helpful, and just a follow-up. Obviously we had the renewal of CP here, I think another contract you had talked about in the past with Kaiser which I think comes up at some point. Any thoughts on where we are with this one and is that more of a fiscal \u201817 issue that we should think about or is that something that we could be renewing soon?","Steve Collis","The contract expires in our fourth quarter of this fiscal year, and we certainly had thought about early renewal but each large contract renewal and it\u2019s a very large customer. It\u2019s a little different and we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to renew it early but that\u2019s not impossible, but we still expect that our guidance would hold true even if we do renew Kaiser early or we announce a contract renewal with them, which should really be as you pointed out fiscal year \u201917 event. So of course that\u2019s an ongoing process so we can\u2019t comment too much about it. ","Barbara Brungess","Next question please. ","Operator","Our question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Just a couple of quick ones, if we think about the GPL renewal, how early was it? When was it originally scheduled to be renewed? And I'm just trying to get a sense for whether or not it was contemplated in the guidance?","Steve Collis","That was not contemplated in the guidance, we would have contemplated in fiscal year \u201917. As I said we haven\u2019t really started doing our detail planning for that. So it was not contemplated, but we had an opportunity and I had a great meeting with their Board along with our senior drug and independent pharmacy, and I was really encouraged by their willingness to commit.","Think about nine years from now to think about signing a contract for all the members, and one of their Board members was very emotional, almost have been and talked about the responsibility they have to their patients to their employees, to the different members, and it is kind of a voluntary group. They get together for various reasons and the fact that we are willing to commit to ABC we took as a good sign. ","So we went ahead and there wasn\u2019t a formal [RAP] process and that\u2019s actually how a lot of our industry works. Customers like staying with their current wholesaler in most cases and absent some changes in ownership with that, you know a lot of customers do stay with us even though it\u2019s a very competitive environment. ","So we are so excited with the new Elevate program that Dave knew and he\u2019s working hard on them adding different elements to that. Our (inaudible) and the new contracting that we have with many networks to get CPA really embedded in that is very important to our whole good neighbor pharmacy offering including to the other good neighbor pharmacy members. ","The strength of their program is having a robust membership and for us sorry a very high level services and high level of efficiency on the purchasing side. So that was part of that decision there.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","That is great color, Steve. Congrats on that. I would ask everybody is obviously focused on the generic drug price issue. Do your contracts with generic manufacturers typically allow you to retain minimum economics or earnings in the face of a deflationary environment or any color you can provide us around how those contracts work? ","And how should we think about how those contracts are similar or are different to the IMAs on the brand side where you guys capture a certain amount of value? It almost looks like kind of fee for service and a certain amount of value that is tied to spread. And I guess is that something that you guys moving back to a deflationary environment will think about as we move into the next round of negotiations?","Steve Collis","One of the things that\u2019s really important to our customers is protection on the down side if products do decline. I think that one of the best way that I can answer is refer back to my comments on [WBAD] and the global scale and sourcing that we have and the fact that we did this is 2013 was one of the key drivers for our product agreement and the equity and the warrants and the [four] seats that we gave to WBA and at that it was two separate companies of course now they have come together. ","So that was a key driver and the contracting process is really it\u2019s not necessary that you\u2019ve seen one and you\u2019ve seen them all. We\u2019ve try to have a fairly wide sourcing philosophy and that\u2019s true both at ABC and at WBAD. So we think we\u2019re very well positioned and that puts our customer in a good position and it puts our relationship with the suppliers in a good position. ","So we feel that we can be successful in any generic environment, and the agreements with generic manufacturers are more market share based, they are more performance based as opposed to the IMAs on the branded side. I would just characterize it as that. ","Barbara Brungess","Given we\u2019re past noon, let\u2019s take one more question please. ","Operator","Our question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird","First, two topics, both have already been briefly touched on, first one\u2019s on the tax rate. Understand the drivers of this year, curious what your thoughts are next year and beyond? Should we for now just be using something around 33.5 and holding that or is there a reason to expect a big delta two years out?","Tim Guttman","Hey Eric its Tim. I would say it\u2019s kind of early to talk about next year. We feel that the 33.5% is durable. We are committed to always looking at the tax rate and trying to do what we can, but I would model it off to 33.5 for now. ","Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird","Second one is I think Charles hit on this one. You talked about meeting with the ABDC leadership in the near-term and that you are going to be expecting some strong operating margin improvement in fiscal \u201817 in that group. But today we are bringing the core outlook down a little bit on the CPA renewal. And if I am not mistaken I think you have at least Humana, Kaiser and Express Scripts all renewing over the next several months. ","So I guess Steve, my question is do your comments on the fiscal \u201817 operating margin expansion, does that really contemplate what could happen with somewhere the tens of billions of revenue renewing over the next six to seven months? Just curious on how that plays into your earlier comments?","Steve Collis","Humana is not in fiscal \u201917 and I am not quite sure when it is, we call follow-up with you that. Certainly Kaiser and Express are renewing. Kaiser has been a long term contract and of course we do expect that we will renew at a market rate that has changed. A lot has changed that was seven year contract I believe that is now here and so we expect that. ","So my comments meeting with the Drug Company leadership team was around, what sort of growth can we expect going forward. And I will tell you that, the Drug Company is (inaudible) so it\u2019s not specifically our margin because it\u2019s too early, it\u2019s really around what growth rate do we expect for the Drug Company and those gross profit dollars are very important to us as well as they are to our shareholders and of course no business is more working capital efficient than our drug company. So that\u2019s another key value driver that we look for from the Drug Company. ","My comment was really around when we do meet with Bob Mauch and his team we expect them to be generating growth next year. ","Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird","So on Humana just hate to clarify, but in February of 2011 you announced the five-year agreement taking effect in May 1 of 2011, so would that not lead to a renewal in May of 2016?","Steve Collis","Yeah I believe there\u2019s been subsequent negotiation so Barbara please. ","Barbara Brungess","We\u2019ve had an interim agreement with them Eric. We can\u2019t really give the detail given that they are in a transaction mode. So --.","Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird","Got it. Okay, fair enough, thanks for the clarification on that. Appreciate the comments.","Barbara Brungess","With that Steve do you have --.","Steve Collis","Yeah thanks for the questions and we\u2019ve had a robust discussion today which Tim and Barbara and I and everyone on our ABC team has enjoyed and we hope that you could see that we try to be as transparent and thoughtful about the information we\u2019ve provided you. I would just end by saying that I feel really good about how AmerisourceBergen is positioned, the customer relationships we enjoy, the supply relationships we enjoy and the way that we thoughtfully deploy capital to create long term shareholder value. So thank you for attention today. ","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Steve and thank you everyone for joining us this morning.

I'm Bennett Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release and are also available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes.

Steve?","Steve Collis","Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. Today, I'm pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's continued strong performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The critical role we play in the US healthcare systems and how we continue advancing our people, culture and strategy to position AmerisourceBergen for long-term growth.","First, our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial performance. Revenues increased a solid 5% to $45.2 billion for the quarter, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76, an increase of 14% compared to the previous fiscal year period. We are extremely pleased with the continued overall strong performance by both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health groups. This quarter's results reflect solid execution, continued strong specialty product sales, growth of some of our largest customers and the overall strength across our businesses.","The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment grew operating income quite well as our distribution business continues to work diligently to serve our manufacturer and provide our customers more efficiently and effectively. First, our innovative services and solutions continue to provide our partners with access to a state-of-the-art distribution network and best-in-class customer experience offerings, enabling them to provide a more integrated seamless and personalized experience for their patients, while enhancing their ability to maximize business performance. Next, we are leveraging our expertise, capabilities and actionable insights to identify and execute new opportunities that create shared value for all stakeholders. Finally, our specialty distribution and practice management services are supporting market access to complex pharmaceuticals and enabling community-based providers to run their practices more efficiently, while ensuring patients have access to vital pharmaceuticals, when and where they need them.","For PharMEDium, progress continues as expected. As we communicated this past May, the consent decree was finalized, and PharMEDium is currently in the midst of a third-party audit inspection at two open facilities, while they continue their commercial operations. The results from these audits will be an important input into an assessment of a future work plan to reopen the Memphis facility. Entering into the consent decree and completing these initial third-party orders inspections are meaningful milestones for PharMEDium as we continue our ongoing comprehensive, strategic and financial review of the business.","Moving on to our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health business group reported as Other. We are extremely pleased with their performance this quarter as the Group achieved double-digit year-over-year operating income growth, led by strong performance from MWI Animal Health. During the third quarter, MWI benefited from solid demand from its strong customer base, particularly within the companion animal health segment. The business also continued to efficiently service its customers and their patients by driving additional cost efficiency through technology improvements. MWI along with World Courier and the entire comprehensive portfolio of AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services businesses are executing on their plans and continuing to find new ways to expand upon our robust and pharmaceutical-centered value proposition, creating additional value for our customers and partners.","Our leading data and technology platforms, new digital tools and partnerships are creating additional efficiencies, enhancing the customer experience and advancing patient outcomes from manufacturers. As manufacturers needs the above, AmerisourceBergen will continue to respond with differentiated solutions that further support enhanced access for pharmaceutical commercialization in companion and production animal health products, making AmerisourceBergen the central partner for the global pharmaceutical industry.","AmerisourceBergen devote the same relentless focus and unwavering support toward creating value for our downstream customers. Community providers are the cornerstone of access and care in their local communities. AmerisourceBergen's ongoing commitment to community providers, including independent pharmacists, reflects our continued recognition and support of the value that they bring to patients and their local communities.","Last week, we actively engaged a record number of our independent pharmacy partners At ThoughtSpot 2019, our Annual Conference and Trade Show hosted by Good Neighbor Pharmacy. This conference provided independent community pharmacies with practical and clinical education resources, helping them optimize their businesses, especially as community pharmacy becomes a support local movement. As resilient and customer service-oriented entrepreneurs, independent community pharmacies differentiate themselves by being hyper-local and customizing their store experience with hometown pride in mind. AmerisourceBergen is committed to empowering our 4,600 independent pharmacists customers to tell their stories and serve their patients with additional help from tools and resources that we provide.","For example, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy's networks business and market services -- marketing services are enabling pharmacists to focus on the in-store experience for patients, connect effectively with providers and create a unique experience tailored to their community. We have also introduced more digital tools to help pharmacists personalize the care they provide and measure the impact of their performance. Moreover, our Elevate Provider Network provides pharmacies with intuitive analytics and benchmarking system solutions to help pharmacies maximize profitability, improve operational effectiveness and enhance patient care.","On a much broader industry scale, AmerisourceBergen as a driver solutions continues to advocate and support independent pharmacists and all of our community-based provider customers by telling their stories to patients, providers and lawmakers. Our passion and commitment to being a solution provider in the US healthcare system has not wavered. AmerisourceBergen responds when customer needs or problems arise. We are a forward thinking and creative organization that we'll always look to be a part of the solution and relentless in our pursuit of opportunities that can add value for our customers and partners, as well as drive efficiency, support transparency and enhance access within a safe and secure healthcare supply chain.","We also respond as a global solutions leader when industry challenges like the opioid epidemic confront the -- entire healthcare industry and local communities. AmerisourceBergen understand and appreciate the enormity of the opioid challenge and we take our role in the supply chain very seriously. We continue to collaborate with our partners and other stakeholders to stop suspicious orders and to halt diversion. Notably as a logistics provider and distributor, we do not have access to patient information and we are not qualified to interfere with a very personal clinical decisions made between patients and their physicians. That said, we recognized the important role we play in the supply chain and work hard every day to be a responsible company, providing daily reports to the DEA of all controlled substances shipped to our customers, including opioid-based medications.","Building on the Company's commitment to transparency, AmerisourceBergen will be releasing a comprehensive report next month, describing how we as a Company have responded to opioid epidemic including the Board's oversight of risks associated with the Company's role as a distributor prescription opioid medications. Our actions are reflection of the innovative problem solving culture driven by AmerisourceBergen's 21,000 associates, who work tirelessly every day across over 50 countries to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.","Our people are a competitive advantage for AmerisourceBergen, anchoring on our strongly defined purpose and under the leadership of our Chief Human Resources Officer, Silvana Battaglia, we continue to make advancing our people and culture the top priority. First, we are making investments to further engage, develop and attract talents. We are expanding opportunities for career growth development and collaboration across the Company to support our corporate strategy and accelerate our growth as one ABC.","On the topic of attracting talent, we're excited to welcome our new Chief Strategy Officer, Leslie Donato, who joined us a few weeks ago and brings nearly 30 years of long-range strategy and healthcare industry expertise to AmerisourceBergen. Reporting directly to me, Leslie, along with the team would help us identify and implement growth initiatives that drive value for our manufacturer partners and provider customers and continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Leslie's experience in global business development, strategy in the pharmaceutical industry make her an impeccable candidate to lead and grow our strategy function.","Next, we are keeping our commitments to diversity and inclusion within our workforce and supply base. As a Company, we are proud of our perfect score on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's premier benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, and remain steadfast in expanding our diversity and inclusion efforts to further strengthen the innovative, creative and diverse exchange of ideas and solutions that can enrich the value that we can provide to all of our stakeholders.","AmerisourceBergen's culture is inspired by purpose, shape through collaboration through rooted in mutual respect for one another. We are leading through our guiding principles, promoting recognition and appreciation for strong performance and ensuring a safe and secure work environment in order to fortify our competitive edge. Advancing our people and culture, further supports and enables AmerisourceBergen to be well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value and delivering long-term sustainable growth. We appreciate the unique value each associate brings to AmerisourceBergen, while also recognizing the collective and vital role in AmerisourceBergen and our industry play in enabling access to pharmaceuticals for the patients that need them.","Overall, the pharmaceutical distribution industry deliver unparalleled efficiency access and security to the US healthcare system. In research, published this week, Deloitte analyzed the critical role that distributors play in connecting two highly fragmented markets of 1,300 manufacturers and a 180,000 points of dispensing. The report noted that distributors do much more and ship products from manufacturers to pharmacies and providers, highlighting that our industries core services which include distribution, inventory management, financial risk management and information sharing generate 10s of billions of dollars in value annually to the healthcare ecosystem.","Alongside the industry's value proposition, AmerisourceBergen possesses a differentiated and well-established strategy and unique value proposition that takes advantage of key macro trends in Health Care. AmerisourceBergen is a pharmaceutical centric leader in distribution and commercialization services, continues to benefit from growth in the US pharmaceutical market, which is driven by innovation, patient demographics, and prescription utilization trends. Our focus on strong customer partnerships in each market segments and innovative services and solutions, both upstream and downstream, further enables us to grow and evolve to address the needs of manufacturers, providers and the patients they serve.","We are a trusted partner to manufacturers and providers, a responsible steward of shareholder's capital, and more than ever, a global solutions leader, united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. As we head into our fiscal 2020 planning process, we feel confident that our business strategy, relationships and execution position AmerisourceBergen to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results. Jim?","Jim Cleary","Thanks, Steve. [Audio gap] stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior-year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release.","As we closed in on the end of our fiscal year, we are extremely proud of the performance of our associates to deliver strong operating results. The execution and efficiency across our businesses is clearly benefiting our results as we continue to work diligently to be the partner of choice, both upstream and down.","Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. I will provide commentary in two main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance.","Moving now to our third quarter results. We had strong performance for revenue growth, expense management, operating income growth, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 14% primarily due to higher operating income, a lower share count and lower net interest expense. Our consolidated revenue was $45.2 billion, up 5%, primarily driven by solid revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group. Gross profit increased 5% or $58 million to $1.2 billion. Operating expenses increased 3.7% to $723 million. We had solid overall expense management this quarter as we continue to focus on effectively managing operating expenses throughout the business and have been able to move faster than originally anticipated to capture synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith.","Additionally, we had a favorable impact on the SG&A line from better than expected healthcare benefit related costs. Consolidated operating income was $507 million, up 6.8%, with our operating margin up 2 basis points. As a reminder, we have lapsed the headwind caused by PharMEDium over the previous four quarters, lapping the headwind from that business helped slightly with our year-over-year comparison. Net interest expense decreased $11 million to $36 million, primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our average invested cash balance, and an increase in interest rates. Given our strong cash flow year-to-date and the better than expected interest income, we continue to expect our net interest expense to be lower for the fiscal year.","Moving now to income taxes. Our income tax rate was 21%, up from 20.3% the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count decreased 4% to 211 million shares. We repurchased $175 million of our shares this quarter. As a result of our opportunistic share repurchases this year, we have bought back over $520 million of shares in the first nine months of our fiscal year.","Regarding free cash flow and cash balance. Year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which excludes the benefit of $143 million of antitrust litigation settlements. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, of which $660 million was held offshore and the majority was US denominated cash. This completes the review of our consolidated results, now I'll turn to our segment results.","Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $43.5 billion, up 4.7%. The segment continues to benefit from strong specialty product sales, growth of some of its largest customers and overall market growth. Segment operating income increased about 4.9% to $412 million, with our operating income margin up 1 basis point. Our unique and balanced portfolio of customers and industry leading specialty distribution businesses are key drivers of our performance and positively differentiate AmerisourceBergen.","Additionally, I will highlight that we have had notable success this year relating to increased penetration within our existing health systems customer base. The execution by our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses continues to be impressive as our teams worked tirelessly to create significant value for our partners', both upstream and down, all while maintaining focus on managing our operating expenses.","I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $1.7 billion, up 9% primarily due to growth at MWI and Consulting's Canadian operations. MWI had an exceptionally strong quarter, recording it's first ever billion dollar revenue quarter, driven by particularly strong growth in companion animal, including strength and new customer wins and increased sales to existing customers.","From an operating income standpoint, the Other segment had operating income of $95 million, up 16%. This group is lapping some challenging quarters and also experiencing some nice growth at multiple businesses. In particular, in this quarter, MWI continues to benefit from maintaining, expanding and adding strong customer relationships with an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer service while optimizing its operations.","Also in the Other segment, and taking a step back from this quarter's results, we continue to be encouraged by the success Lash has had in both renewing and winning long-term customer relationships in fiscal 2019, particularly compared to fiscal 2017 and 2018. The Fusion platform continues to be a differentiator for Lash's service offering and while fiscal 2019 continues to be a transition year for Lash, we are excited about the long-term outlook of the business. This completes the review of our segment results.","So now I will turn to our fiscal 2019 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance from $6.70 to $6.90 to our new guidance range of $7 to $7.10 as businesses across AmerisourceBergen continue to execute at a high level.","Turning now to our operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the 3% to 4% range as we have narrowed our Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income guidance to a range of 2% to 3% growth. Our operating income guidance for the Other segment is unchanged at high single-digit growth for the fiscal year. Regarding tax rate. Entering the last quarter of the year, we are narrowing our tax rate guidance from a range of 21% to 22% to guidance of approximately 21%.","Turning now to free cash flow. Given our significant free cash flow year-to-date, we now expect our adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019 to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, up from our previous guidance range of $1.4 billion to 1.6 billion. Regarding share count, given the amount of opportunistic share repurchases year-to-date, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to approximately 212 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 214 million shares for the year. Lastly, we are not making any changes to our working assumptions around pharmaceutical pricing for the full fiscal year. Broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year.","Turning now to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses. However, as a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be a lower contribution period for us. Notably, our operating expenses tend to be higher in that quarter as we exit the fiscal year and we are not expecting the SG&A favorability experienced in the third quarter to repeat in the fourth. As it pertains to fiscal 2020, our corporate process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for our guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.","In closing, to the execution and efficiency delivered across AmerisourceBergen continues to be impressive. AmerisourceBergen's strategy, leadership in growing markets, strong customer relationships, and our transition toward one ABC to increase collaboration and develop talent across the enterprise have us well positioned to continue to create long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen.","Now I will turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from the company of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve -- I just wanted to talk about the margin experience this quarter, clearly had strong margins in both segments, and Jim I appreciate the detail, but I was wondering if you can unpack those margins a little bit, maybe give us a better sense for what really drove the strength in each of the segments, so to help us better assess maybe the sustainability of some of those trends as we look to the balance of the year and into fiscal '20? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Steve Collis","Glen, I'd like to answer the question, but Jim Cleary is literally jumping off his seat to answer. So I'm going to give our CFO the opportunity.","Jim Cleary","All right, thanks. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, Glen, we feel very good about the quarter, and one of the things we feel good about is, as you brought up in your question, the margin performance in the quarter and starts kind of general, then I'll get into the details of it. First of all, one thing driving our margins, it's our strong value proposition, and we feel like we offer very high quality services and logistics, financing, safety, security and we offer them very efficiently, so we feel we're very fairly compensated for those services and have a strong value proposition.","If we kind of look at the overall business, revenue is up 5%, gross profit up 5%, operating expenses up 3.7%, and operating income 6.8%, so we actually had a 2 basis point improvement in operating margin. And looking at Pharma Distribution, and I'll get a little bit more into the details here. Revenue up 4.7%, operating income up 4.9%, so 1 basis point improvement in operating margin in Pharma Distribution and that was really driven by very strong performance in specialty, in particular, our specialty physicians, services business and of course all the wraparound practice management services that we offer, benefit our margins, and was driven by really strong performance with health systems and we had good generic penetration with customers and our health systems business unit, and so that was a benefit also.","And then I'll also call out expense management benefited us also, and we got to, kind of, a run rate of HD Smith synergies sooner than anticipated. So all those things really contributed strong across -- across the Board performance and Pharma Distribution caused us that 1 basis point improvement in operating margin in Pharma Distribution and there's also actually a 1 basis point improvement in gross margin also in Pharma Distribution.","And in Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, we had very good performance on revenue and operating income, and very strong improvement in operating margin, and really operating margin is a relevant metric to look at in that business, because really kind of business mix between the different business units can really impact gross margin and our other segment. So very strong revenue, operating margin in Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health. We talked about the very good performance in animal health in the quarter. We also had very solid performance in World Courier, which has been operating at a very high level for quite some time and good performance in our Consulting business and we called out the Canadian business during our prepared remarks. So I'd say those businesses are very well positioned in their respective markets and taking advantage of opportunities which really kind of drove the operating margin improvement in the Other segment.","With regard to Q4, you had asked about Q4 and kind of the good operating performance, very solid operating performance is built into our guidance increase that you'll see, and so we are expecting very solid operating performance in Q4. We probably won't have some of the G&A benefits, particularly, kind of, we don't expect to see our internal health benefit costs, we don't expect that to repeat in Q4. We probably won't have the same benefit in interest expense in Q4, but of course that doesn't impact the margins of our business. And you asked also about the 2020. We are in the midst of our planning process for 2020 and that process is going quite well and we will provide 2020 guidance when we announce our year-end results.","Glen Santangelo","Thank you so much for the detail. Steve, maybe I'll just ask you one quick follow-up on the specialty business. It clearly seems to be a big driver for you and others, and given all the regulatory proposals that are out there that seem to be targeting the higher prices of these specialty drugs. One question that sort of keeps coming up to us is, can any of these proposals impact the supply chain? Are there any, in particular, that you're paying attention to? How do you sort of reconcile that as it relates to your business? Thanks and I'll stop there.","Steve Collis","Yeah. Thank you. I'm really very proud of our continued strong performance in our specialty businesses. We really have a unique portfolio of market leading companies there. Of course, we don't own any practices, but really create a lot of practice management services. Our oncology business is, of course, our [indiscernible] business data. Our Besse Medical business also had a really strong results with much more therapies and being administered in Part D offsetting outside of oncology, including urology, ophthalmology and even orthopedics responding to do some work there. So it's just so much innovation occurring in these settings, in fact, many of the new therapies, the immuno-oncology drugs already additive to existing product utilization trends. So and we have just a great portfolio of customers.","Our customers are often to have aggregate of this. So we retaining our strong relationships with them and we have even announced some key resignings, but there are also some of the consolidators as it's a difficult environment in oncology for smaller practices, Q2, to be self-sustaining. So it is trendy for the larger practices and we tend to have a strong enduring long-term relationships with a lot of those customers. But you know, our team has been in place for a long time. We've had some really good at generation top changes there that have brought in some leader that have been around a long time, but have fresh visions for the Company. Our relationships with pharma in these areas is very strong. I just couldn't be prouder and more confident in the way we positioned in these position specialty distribution businesses. So there have been just a terrific performance in fiscal year '19, but even in the proceeding years as well.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Eric Percher","Thank you. And given that you raised the opioid topic, maybe a question there. I want to ask you to comment on the ongoing litigation. But as we scratch the surface of the ARCOS data. It appears that diversion activity looks very different maybe along the blue highway in other areas of the country. And I'd love to get your perspective on whether that is the case, and anything you can share relative to how you view your position? And then relative to the report, that's coming, maybe part two of the question, how do you balance the need to improve your own operations without handing ammunition to the plaintiffs?","Steve Collis","Well, first of all that data was through 2012. I've just finished my 8th year as CEO and that was my first year as CEO. And also in 2013, the market shifted a lot with us taking over the Walgreens distribution and we took over all the distribution that we point to that as a key -- the key change in the market for us, as we took over both brand generics and even controlled substances. So you know, last night -- I'll tell you a personal story quickly. We had an event for our foundation and one of the foundation charity needs support, it is a company called Eluna that helps with the victims of the crisis as children and provide summer camps for them and we met a few of the cases.","This crisis is one that affects our society. It's one that, you know as an employer we take very seriously. It's one that as a supply chain leader we take very seriously. I think you understand our role and I read your report Eric with a lot of interest. So we work collaboratively to stop suspicious orders. I feel proud of the work we've done. We revamped our program in 2007. We've reported all our suspicious orders and we reported control substances on a daily basis, as well as the [indiscernible] reporting, which is not quite on a daily basis, but is in regular intervals. We've tried to work with, collaborate with the DEA, and all government-sponsored agencies. We feel like we've discharged our responsibility very excitedly and very ardently in the absence of clear information. So the data was interesting. I don't think it's appropriate for me to get into one state, there's not a, you know, we've really looked at this on a distribution center basis, and again, we feel that ABC has acted really extremely responsibly with really one hand tied behind our back. So I think that's what I say. Jim, would you like to add anything?","Jim Cleary","I think that covers it really well, Steve. Thanks.","Eric Percher","Is the goal of the upcoming report to help you identify other areas or to make clear both actions of the past?","Steve Collis","Yeah, you know so we are pleased -- it's been the first positive benefit and we like transparency. We have no problems with transparency. Our Board has had tremendous oversight. We will be coming out in the next few weeks the report from the Board on our own supply chain. The risk that we have as a leading distributor in the pharmaceutical supply chain, really talking about our strong compliance program, our corporate integrity programs. We have, of course, really upped our game on this, even more, I'd say that continued quality improvement really applies here.","One great example is, you know so much more about the customers that we bring on to service, and I don't want to sound arrogant in any way, but I would say that it's a privilege to be in AmerisourceBergen customer. You'll be treated with respect, you will be treated with fairness and we will do our best to service and give you the fairest pricing we can. So what we expect from you is very good ethics and very good monitoring of the prescriptions that you're in a much better position to manage than we are. So that's just one example I could say. We have been very, very scrupulous about what customers we bring on to service particularly in areas of risk, you know pharmacy that service [indiscernible] et cetera. So I think we really covered this topics. Thanks Eric.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, just to go back to some of the growth drivers that you highlighted in the quarter, both you and your competitor who reported last night referenced growth from the largest customers as helping out in the current quarter. It doesn't really seem like we've seen an inflection in the same-store prescription growth at the large retail customers. So just trying to get a better sense of where that growth is really coming from. Is it really more the health systems and from specialty, and if it is those channels, Steve, I'm just curious what is driving the growth there and is it in fact sustainable?","Steve Collis","We saw solid growth in our US businesses and one differentiator from AmerisourceBergen is we are very indexed to the US pharmaceutical business. Our customers are doing interesting things. They are doing acquisition, they're in the forefront of a lot of the change in retail. Obviously, independents are having a tougher comp with reimbursement headwinds, but again, there is nothing new to that. This is a challenge that has been evident for a long time and I think with the guidance of Elevate, some of our pharmacies have made a decision not to participate in narrow networks and have looked at what they can afford with a strong analytics programs that we have had looked and what can they afford to participate.","And I think they are in a better position to understand that data and with the strong sourcing programs we have had and the strong reimbursement access with Elevate, we think that we said our independent pharmacies to know very well what's going on. The largest customers, of course, like our largest customer, WBA, they understand the market well, they have their own resources, you know sort of areas and we are happy with the growth from their customer segment.","One thing I would just point to is the portfolio of customers that we have at ABC. Clearly, and now this is a trend for several years, we have over performed relative to our sales growth in specialty. And at specialty in the Part D setting, but it's also specialty drugs in the core drug distribution business, where there is so much innovation going on, and we saw much of the manufacturers R&D is going. And when I listen to these debates last night, I wonder when one is going to make the point that this is one of the great American manufacturing industries and we are so proud to be a part of this and we see these wonderful new drugs coming out and there is just so many, I mean, 50 biotech companies went public last year. So we just think we're very well positioned and we are a seeing benefit of this innovation.","Jim, anything on any specific segments? Health systems is strong as you pointed out?","Jim Cleary","Yeah, I think -- Steve, as you were saying, what really benefits us is that the broad portfolio of customers, the key anchor customers, independent pharmacies, health systems, physician offices, mail order, veterinary practices in that broad portfolio. And I think, in particular, this quarter, while we benefited really in many, many areas, a couple of things to really call out as we have is specialty and physician practices and health systems. Although that can -- while those businesses should be strong over a longer period of time, different parts of our businesses will benefit us from time to time. So having that broad portfolio is a real strength.","Steve Collis","Yeah, and I'd say of course with the 15% earnings growth year-over-year quarter is outstanding as well. So we were really proud of our performance in some of our smaller higher growth, higher margin businesses as well.","Robert Jones","And then if I could just sneak in one follow-up for Jim. You referenced this better than expected healthcare benefit a few times in the SG&A line. Just curious, what exactly was that and if you could you give us any sense on the size of it? That would be helpful.","Jim Cleary","Yeah, and we actually talked about that and had a similar benefit last quarter, the fiscal second quarter. And so our internal health benefit expenses were better than anticipated and it's really kind of due to a couple of things, one is lower claims experience, and the second is a change and benefit design that we're getting at the beginning of the year. And so that's benefited us the last couple of quarters and it was a couple of pennies in the most recent quarter.","Robert Jones","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to go back a little bit about Part D, a little bit more. I know you touched on it briefly earlier. Obviously, the Senate Finance Committee Bill, I think, Steve, last quarter you talked about your thought that obviously your oncology clients kind of look at the Medicare plan is being sort of a difficult space here. Looking at the Senate Finance Bill proposed, do you think that help solve it with sort of -- moving to sort of this inflation cap and making a sort of a fixed fee for physicians. Obviously a move away from the IPI which seem sort of unworkable. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing with, sort of, the proposed bills as they stand now, and do you think that's a more workable solution for you and your clients?","Steve Collis","Yeah, you know, a lot of the work we do indeed see other than around supply chain integrity and trade quality and safety acts, those sort of things. It is really advocacy for our customers and the leader of our oncology business [indiscernible] us this weekend. We are going to be very active in areas that affect our customers, of course, our biosimilars interest and a sustainable overall brand pricing environment is of course good for us. We also are big on patient access. Our Lash business is probably one of the best-known patient access businesses as we work to get patients access with many of these life-changing products as we can. So we think we're very informed on this issue.","I'd say we bought the Lash Group in 1998, ever since then, we had a really humbling experience of the MMA where our fees were included in ASP. And I think not only ABC, but our industry and our trade associations are really on this. We get that we have to be involved in the political process. You know the political process is pretty dynamic at the moment. I think that might be an understatement. We saw last month and rebate rules changed very drastically and very suddenly. So I think, Charles, our best course is actually to stay the course to be very involved with our customers, work with organizations like we work with [indiscernible] for example, immuno-oncology association in oncology and we really try advocate a fair reimbursement and strong access for the patients that we feel we ultimately represent so that they can get setting in a -- that they can get setting that are most accessible and most comfortable for them and even we believe most affordable. So that's really where we are working very strongly.","Jim, it's an important question there. Anything you want to add?","Jim Cleary","No, I think that covers it. Great, Steve.","Steve Collis","I think Jim said a lot in the first question...","Charles Rhyee","Yeah certainly. And if I missed it earlier, can you just let me know, did you say when the auditing process is expect to be completed for PharMEDium?","Steve Collis","Jim's going to take that.","Jim Cleary","Yeah -- and so the audits of our two open facilities are in progress and that's progressing well. And so it's kind of -- we have previously stated we are continuing operations at two of our facilities and we're also continuing our comprehensive, strategic and financial review of PharMEDium. It's too early to speculate on future decisions, but of course we will take into account the needs of PharMEDium customers and what's best for AmerisourceBergen shareholders and we'll provide updates during our next call. And I will also say that PharMEDium was not headwind during the third quarter as we stated. In fact, it was a very slight tailwind in the third quarter, a smaller operating loss. And again, we don't expect it to be a headwind in the fourth quarter.","Charles Rhyee","But there is no set end date yet for the audit itself, it's just sort of like an ongoing process at the moment?","Jim Cleary","Charles, we expect that -- we expect that we will have the process completed this month.","Charles Rhyee","Okay.","Steve Collis","Yeah, yeah. And I do feel good that I want it on the first of the month, because these things just inevitably take longer than you expect, but we expect it to wrap it up this month.","Charles Rhyee","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning everybody. So if we look at the new first-time generic launches so far in calendar 2019, it's actually been a pretty decent wave of exclusive launches, particularly in products that may see more limited number of suppliers for quite some time. So I'm just curious if you're able to discuss how much of that contribution from new generics is tracking relative to your expectations so far in calendar '19? Thanks.","Steve Collis","You know -- I can't say that we've seen a specific trade and I think we've talked over the last few years that this was when I started CEO, this was the number one metric we looked at. It was actually our first thing we looked at in the plan was what the pipeline is. And you know, as we've talked and explained many times, I think our competitor have had similar discussions that the market has changed. The generic market, I think it's dynamic. We saw big announcement at the beginning of the week, and you know there is a trend for authorized generics which we think will be affected by transparency and if there's anything on the rebate rules. But nothing really particular that we can talk about on new product launches, but the generic market is stable and really where we expected it to be and remains an important contributor to us for our profitability and our customers' profitability.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. Good morning. Steve, just given the strong cash flow, not just in this quarter, but for the year. If I think back to a couple of years ago, you talked about potential strategic acquisitions in the areas of manufacturing services. Just can you give us any update as to how you look at that component of the market would be my question. And then just on the follow-up side, as you think about pricing for both branded and generic, just curious how the quarter trended versus your expectations and you brought up the potential merger, what do you think that could do around your buying group?","Steve Collis","Okay. So I'll take the first one and then Jim do the second one. So thanks for the question, Lisa. We are very active. It's important, I think it's something we spend a lot of Board time with, it's something we spend a lot of management time with, and we're active. If you look at my management team, so many of our team comes from acquisitions, including Bob, who really has head both the pharma distribution and other sector reporting team now. Bob was really the founder of Xcenda. So we need really -- the benefit of acquisitions is not only the portfolio effect and the acceleration of different services that we have and leasing of those services or the gaining of new technologies, say that, if we'd acquired a company that was really good in the areas that we're investing in the Fushion, we could have accelerated that process for example.","So I think, we just -- we are really well experienced in these areas and we want to be behind companies that add new services and new offerings that we don't have. So with businesses like World Courier and Lash and we have very high standards. And you know the markets really and I think we'd be trying to grow those businesses organically. So that's a good example of, do we need to do acquisitions or are we going with internal investment? We have been a lot of -- you've seen us invest $300 million to $400 million approximately every year, a lot of that is in technology to making us easy to do business with, let's say, helping our customers understand the environments better.","We had the trade show last week and our digital offerings for our independent pharmacies, for example, were very well received. So these are areas where we see more fruitful in our results for our shareholders than investing in small companies that sometimes are trading up to 15 to low 20s EBITDA. So we are financially driven as well. Our Board really holds us to stand and the management holds us also to stand. We're seeing these acquisitions be accretive within a reasonable timeframe. So we brought in Leslie Donato and we think Leslie is going to do a great job and she knows the market, she's been a customer in her previous roles. She understands our commercialization businesses. Certainly Jim, our CFO, has done a lot of M&A, but also some very interesting JVs and partnerships, who had made more things to partner with the right company.","So I think we are focused on this area, but it has to be at the right price and it has to be a company that is going to give us really an accelerant in our portfolio for new market share. We did HD Smith model a long ago and I think that's a good example of executing on our core business also as we almost complete all the synergy capture by the end of this fiscal year.","Jim, please answer the second question.","Jim Cleary","Yes, sure. And the second question is I believe were on brand inflation and generic deflation, I'll get into those. But, you are right. Our cash flow is very strong, and of course, we've done over $500 million of share repurchases this fiscal year and also we have been investing a lot in our manufacturer services business like Fusion and Lash, NOVA and World Courier. But with regard to the inflation and deflation question that you would ask, in branded inflation, yes, directionally as expected year-to-date we had set mid-single digits in our fiscal year '19 guidance, directionally as expected. And as you know, 95% of our branded buy side margin is fee for service. So it's really kind of the other 5% that relies on price increases from manufacturers for our economics. And also in generic deflation, generally in the range of original expectations that we had put out at the beginning of the year and kind of generally in range of those original expectations.","Bennett Murphy","And operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Perfect. And our last question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Great, thank you. Good morning. So my question is about a strategic partnership with OneOncology. How is it structured? Do you share the profits and as part of this, do you have an opportunity to introduce formularies? And do you see any clear -- any other opportunities to form similar relationships with other providers?","Steve Collis","Yes. We have -- certainly we announced OneOncology. It's really a partnership with ION and which is a practice management and contracting division. And certainly, again, some of these oncology groups become bigger. Our relationship with them is always interesting. I think they have sort of practice that's going to challenge us to keep on adding new contracting services, a new level of value to them as they really expand into various states. We have, -- Ricky OneOncology is new, we have two or three other customers that of -- that are in the practice aggregation business and that we are contracting with and other customers that are very strong in the region. So this is two of the three founding practices were -- not to get too granular, but two of three founding practices on OneOncology were existing customers. And I think when you go to a new business and this is sort of situation that we've seen in many of our other sector. So we actively participated, and I think we're very proud that AmerisourceBergen was chosen to be the prime vendor in the services provider for that customer.","Thank you for the question. So with that, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call. And I just want to say that I think that this year has been a year of tremendous execution for our business, both on the Pharma Distribution and on the Other sector. Our corporate staff is working very well. We're responding to situations that arise, be it reimbursement or the challenges of opioid process as one ABC. I think you're seeing an intention to get the PharMEDium issues resolved and behind us. So I just think this has been really nine months of solid execution. And as we look at the long-term, I just would point you to the key drivers that have made AmerisourceBergen successful, which is our focus on the supply channel, our really strong deployment of capital and cash flow, whether it be an internal program, acquisitions or business expansion, internal investments and really just the management team that knows how to keep those well placed customers and work with them to ensure that they are successful in the marketplace and in turn AmerisourceBergen is successful. So thank you for your time today. And this has been a pleasure having this hour with you with such good results to share. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our fiscal 2012 second quarter results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen's President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Vice President, Controller and acting CFO.","During the call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2011.","Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. ","We generated $236 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp to this quarter, last year, and exceeded our internal profit goals for each business unit. ","During the quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. ","AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to health care and coverage -- and health care coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional oral medications or complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer pre-launch and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to life-saving therapies and that the products achieve their full potential in the marketplace. ","At our verse [ph] revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry but drive tremendous value for wholesalers, health care providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. ","Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure they meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost-containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  ","Our provider customers work hard every day to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. ","Our associates are focused on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to seek creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great pride in their enthusiasm and dedication, and it is my honor to work beside them. ","Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as expected, had flat revenue in the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segment was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Top line growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence, including decreased sales to our largest customer. ","Our ABDC associates did a stellar job this quarter managing several generic launches, including 5 different generic products that launched within one week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches still to come in the second half of the year. ","With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S., continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients prefer choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions, and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs and at adapting to the changing needs of the marketplace. ","Our ASHP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder planned for the beginning of 2013. As we have gained experience with the new system, particularly with the corporate and back-office functions, we have already begun to realize some operational savings, which is reflected, in part, in the good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. ","Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months, in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningfully increase the value we bring to both independent pharmacies and especially providers in the Canadian market.","As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger of Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon the award and implementation of one or more new pharmaceutical distribution agreements for the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business, and anticipate that the new contract, or contracts, will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process, and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco for over 2 decades, and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. ","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Besse generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is best known for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product establishing significant market share in what was the first full quarter of the introduction. ","Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently helped a manufacturer launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. ","Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in its history, even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. ","We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition, World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity, not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services, but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. ","In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC, and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. ","In addition, we are exploring ways to potentially expand some of our niche Specialty Distribution services into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week, at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. ","Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel, they should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we, historically, have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger, as we did with World Courier, if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders. ","Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of $2.74 to $2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchase assumption for the year. ","Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012, including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASHP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that time frame. ","Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. Demand is strong for the products we distribute, and we play an essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We've positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. ","Over the last year, we were summating important investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand for specialty products to continue to grow, not only the U.S. but throughout the world, and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment efforts continue to cross the health care landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates bring to market every day set us apart in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. ","The highlights this quarter: excellent top line growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses; very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization; and finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. ","Now let's turn to the quarterly details. And starting with the top line, revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. ","The Specialty Group revenues increased 6%, led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. ","The Consulting group, though small to the overall top line, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% top line growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. ","Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March, with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very tough comp, due to the significant contribution in the prior year from oncology generics. In the second quarter 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new oral solid generics, as well as the lower contribution from oncology generics and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. ","Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. ","Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches, and also price appreciation, was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs, including benefits. ","Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected, enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. ","Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3%, due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business, before adding World Courier, to be essentially flat for the year. ","Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. ","Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds help to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. ","Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. ","Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million, compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory levels very closely, and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter-end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full year cash flow estimate. ","Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. ","Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. ","During the quarter, we bought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to fiscal '11. ","With our recent debt offering, our gross debt, the total debt and capital ratio, at the end of March, was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31 was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. ","Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high-single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. ","Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison. With the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year-end generic launches for the Drug Company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. ","So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate, that 6 months into the fiscal year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business, and we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012. ","One final point, I'd like to take a moment and thank our ABC associates, especially those in the finance and accounting areas that have stepped up the last 2 months and helped support the organization and me, in particular, during our CFO transition period. Thanks, everyone. Here's Barbara to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Barbara A. Brungess",".","Thank you, Tim. Operator, we'll now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead, operator.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to quickly follow up, Tim, with respect to some of your comments on the operating margin expansion goals for the year. Previously the company had expected operating margin expansion in the high single-digit, kind of low double-digit range and now, it seems like you're suggesting high single-digit. I guess -- could just give me a sense for maybe what has changed in that thinking? And I know there were some onetime costs that you're now embedding in your estimates, and I'm curious if there's anything else that I should be thinking about.","Tim G. Guttman","No, we changed our guidance to high single-digit. In terms of looking out, we did an assessment of the full year, and looking out, we had some deal costs in Q2 and some onetime items, nonrecurring items. And as we look out, we're going to have some similar costs in Q3 with the World Courier transaction. So when we look out and do a reassessment, we felt more comfortable that high single-digit was a realistic target for us for the year, and there's really nothing else factored into that.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Tim, maybe if I could just ask a follow up on the World Courier group. You originally sort of guided $0.06 to $0.10 worth of accretion and I'm kind curious, is there anything embedded from an accretion standpoint in your fiscal '12 guidance as it relates to World Courier? And it kind of sounds like you're going to be taking down some integration costs or acquisition-related costs next quarter. I don't know if you care to size those at this point.","Tim G. Guttman","Glen, no. We will have some transaction-related acquisition costs in Q3. Probably not more than the number that we had for Q2. And there is no accretion in our numbers for this fiscal year. We expect it to be neutral. And in terms of next year, for fiscal '13, we're still confident with that guidance of $0.06 to $0.10.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So my question is as follows, Steve, around Medco. Here you're communicating -- I guess, is it fair to say that you voluntarily agreed to move up the termination date of your Medco relationship by 6 months? And if so, is there any benefit for doing so, and possibly foregoing that profit stream? And then just around the topic, I wanted to confirm, you said you've already have a relationship with Express Scripts. How long have you had that? And then have you disclosed or in a position to comment about the length of the suggested new contract under the RFP?","Steven H. Collis","First of all, obviously, we are part of a very active process here and we want to be very respectful of that and some of the questions should really be directed to the buyer. But I think ABC, as you know, has been very proud of over 2 decades of service to Medco and now, you could almost say we are the incumbent here because we've had such a long relationship. So we wanted to demonstrate flexibility. We wanted to recognize that this is a new entity that has their own requirements and will have a different dynamics to relationship. And now it just made sense for us to be concurrent with the current requirements. So we demonstrated flexibility. We demonstrated that ABC is a good partner and listens to our customers and I think that, that will hopefully put us in a good position throughout the contracting process, but it will be competitive. And, I guess, the only internal benefit I can point to is that this is concurrent with our fiscal year, and whatever happens, we'll be in a good position to plan for it and to communicate that to our investors.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you're uncomfortable commenting about the length of the contract as proposed in the RFP at this point.","Steven H. Collis","As far as we know, as far as we could say, it's pretty standard type of contract term.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Right. So we assume, maybe 3 years, but again, not commenting. And I guess just a follow-up to you and Tim around SAP implementation, we appreciate the update there. If you let it to go back or remember some of the bigger expenses for this, seemed to be fiscal '10 and '11, $40 million to $50 million a year, you've mentioned, Tim, stability sooner than you thought. Can you ballpark kind of expenses around SAP for you this year? And how do we think about that comparable to next year?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Larry, our guidance has been that we'll see some benefit for SAP next year, 6 months after our last DC deployment, so we expect that to be in Q4, and we've guided to $10 million. And we expect the full benefit of about $40 million to be in '14. And so far, the benefit that we've had this year for SAP is really incremental for that. I mean, this is just expense that we've been able to take out of our operating budget, which has probably been a few million dollars. So again, they're separate. One's not a part of the other.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I got it. Right. Expenses associated with consultants and such, but again, $10 million incremental next year, $40 million for '14. And then just to clarify, I think it's an important point, the guidance confirming the range, but you're suggesting the $0.02, which was the severance and transaction cost this quarter and the $0.02 which -- ballpark of transaction cost next quarter, are included now in that range. You're not breaking that out at all?","Tim G. Guttman","No, absolutely, Larry. We're GAAP, and we include that in.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And again, you're saying that's a big reason why you're top and the operating margin expansion has been pulled down?","Tim G. Guttman","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert C. Jones - Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.","Just to go back to the Express Scripts contract. Steve, it sounds like -- you mentioned contract, or contracts, so I'm assuming there's some suggestion that it could be broken up. Any insight into this view or maybe, more importantly, what benefit that would create for Express to have this contract separated?","Steven H. Collis","Well, I think, in terms of processing, there's not much differentiation between s $10 billion contract, or a $15 billion, or $20 billion contract, it's just that, that is the way these large contracts tend to go. And there could be some geographical, regional benefit, based on where they're planning to have their large mail-order sites, there could be a way to separate the specialty business with the core mail-order business. So we have 2 big specialty units so -- but again, these are questions that we probably are not that comfortable commenting on and could probably be best be directed to Express Scripts, sir.","Robert C. Jones - Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.","No, I definitely appreciate that. And I guess just one follow-up, Steve. Given the somewhat more acquisitive nature of the company as of late, and I know you've gotten this question before and I imagine as you continue to do acquisitions, you might get it more in the future, relative to your peers. Any thoughts or discussion between you and Tim about moving to a cash EPS, or at least breaking out a cash EPS?","Steven H. Collis","No, we haven't. We lack -- we think we report not only good earnings, but very high quality earnings and, at the moment, that hasn't been under consideration.","Tim G. Guttman","And we, in our public company filings, we feel we give pretty good disclosure on some of those differences, especially around intangibles. And the reader of those documents can go ahead and do that calculation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you could expand on some of your prepared remarks around sort of international and how you see the opportunity may be there over -- not the near-term necessarily but the next few to 5 years, it sounds like maybe World Courier is a bit of a platform that you could grow from in different ways, so if you have any thoughts there, it would be appreciated.","Steven H. Collis","Well there's a couple of things. First of all, again, we do $300 million in revenue a day, as ABC, but one of the things we've been very, very happy with is our specialty performance in Canada. This is -- this market works differently than it does in the U.S., but we've been able to do some joint programs, we've been able to help with a more complex reimbursement environment there, including a pretty robust product market that we -- that is not generally known. At least here, in the U.S., we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible drugs. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with, that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look at international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier, we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been extremely impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, health care is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand health care markets, both organic and acquisitive opportunities, with people on the ground there who speak the language and know the trends, know who's the right players, the ethical players, the high quality players in that environment. And we think that, that's going to give us a good opportunity. We also think that as the products that World Courier is managing are commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as -- middle class is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being big [indiscernible] sort of -- and especially consumers of products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. Think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know the treatment centers, they know the environment. So we think that we have to recharacterize part of the business, but we think we can do that, so long answer, but as you can tell, I'm very enthusiastic about this.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Sure, that's clear. And then maybe just one housekeeping item. On the CapEx, can you sort of breakdown your maintenance CapEx versus maybe what's additional and some of those projects that you highlighted earlier, do they seep into next year? Should we assume that it comes back down a little bit, or how are you thinking about that?","Tim G. Guttman","Good question. No, we -- when we look at maintenance CapEx, we think it's typically between about $100 million and $120 million. We have some big projects this year supporting our expansion up in Canada. We're looking at another DC project in the U.S. in terms of expansion, automation, renovation and our TheraCom acquisition. So I would say that the $200 million is probably a peak, and it definitely should come down next year. Probably about half of the maintenance CapEx is probably a good -- kind of a good range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, what kind of clarity do you actually have on -- does the RFP provide for you? I mean, I assume you would have size of the potential contract, the mail footprint you'd be serving, whether or not specialty would be there. I mean, are there some things you could disclose there that would be helpful for us?","Steven H. Collis","I think, we partly said, Bob, I appreciate your interest in this and, believe you me, I am really interested in this and the ABC team is very interested in this. We're just participating fully in the RFP process, it has just begun. So I could tell you we really don't -- we think it's in the range of about a $20 billion contract. So I will tell you that Medco peaked with ABC at about 19% of our revenues in fiscal year 2011, and it's come off a few percent from that, and our current run rate is more in the mid-teens, 16% range. So we could potentially gain some couple billion dollars in new revenue here.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And any sense on timing, when a decision will ultimately be made, obviously, before October 1. But how much time would you need? And do you anticipate if you win, is there investment you need to make or in the unfortunate event you don't win, what kind of offsets we might see to your cost structure, some initiatives you'd pursue?","Steven H. Collis","Well, we're mainly servicing the current business out of 3 DCs, and we certainly would start giving consideration to what it could mean if we lose. But from a more exciting basis, I think we do have the capacity to service this business without much incremental investment. And we look forward to talking about the different capabilities that ABC brings to the table. And we're participating fully in this contract.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And timing, Steve? Anything?","Steven H. Collis","No, I just think you know -- I think you know -- you cover Express Scripts. You know they move quickly, so that's all I can tell you. They don't let the grass grow under their feet. So we expect them to have a very active and quick and decisive process unlike this other very public contract that we went through very recently. So that should make everyone happy, at least, we'd all know where we stand very quickly. We believe so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up [ph] on the Medco Express side, from what we understand, specialty is included in your relationship with legacy Medco. Should we assume that the services that you provided to Medco on the specialty side are more of wholesale-type services, or do you also provide them kind of like the added value services that's associated with your specialty business?","Steven H. Collis","We are both the wholesaler to the former Accredo division, the Accredo division of Medco, and now will be Express Scripts. And we have, obviously, worked very collaboratively with them in many areas including the hospital, pharmacy area and the specialty area. So I can't -- I'm not comfortable pointing to any particular program, but certainly as our largest customer, we spend a lot of time working on common approaches to the marketplace, and we would expect to bring that expertise and that market knowledge and the manufacturer relationships that we have to the combined entity now.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then I have a couple of just questions from modeling purposes. For the SG&A level for the remainder of the year, should we assume same level as we saw in the March quarter or should we see a step up, and if so, can you quantify for us? And is it related to World Courier?","Tim G. Guttman","We, at this point, Ricky, we don't have World Courier finished yet, completed. But definitely with World Courier coming in 2 months in quarter 3 and we'll have them for the entire Q4, they will add extra expense. When I gave the guidance today this morning, again, I was talking about the core business being flat. For the core business, we will see a little bit of a step up in 3, but probably not dramatic. And again, we will have some nonrecurring acquisition-related cost in Q3, probably not in Q4.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just qualify to us the impact from a basis point perspective of the acquisitions on the margins for this quarter?","Tim G. Guttman","In terms of SG&A?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","SG&A or operating margin.","Tim G. Guttman","Well again, we commented that we had about $11 million of SG&A expense in the quarter from our acquisitions, primarily TheraCom. So again, it's probably 4, 3, 4 basis points.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I think a lot of the timely questions have been answered, so I'll shift gears a bit. Health systems and alternate site in your drug company, sound like another good quarter there, above market growth, perhaps. I'm curious if you can define what's leading to this growth. It must be share capture, I don't want to lead you too much, but the market's clearly not growing at a rapid pace. You're primarily doing pharmaceuticals and not the other broad med service lines or other services into the health systems. So could you just give us some better sense on what's driving that growth in health systems and alternate site and then perhaps if you could frame it, would be helpful, too.","Steven H. Collis","Well with health systems, we think we have a market share that is, at least comparable, maybe even the largest in the U.S. We believe we're with the right customers, we believe that we're growing with them. We believe that we have some nice little services that we provide that maybe don't get the headlines, but they are additive to their business, like helping them with 340B consulting, helping them with price pharmacy. So we have a very good practice in health systems, and we believe we're with the companies that are the leaders in that space, and I think some of our customers are there. Likewise with alternate care, I think ABC has been a leader there. Certainly our knowledge of specialty and our ability to offer an integrated solution on the specialty and drug wholesale side and our knowledge of the manufacturing environment and the patient environment and the reimbursement environment has been very, very helpful. And the Humana contract, we think ,was a direct result of that knowledge, and that's a very fast grower. We're with a lot of the companies that are growing faster than the market and when we discuss potential RFP responses, we look at who do we think will be the winners in a certain space, and we like to really target them and try to get them into the ABC portfolio. So I think you could look at it as it's not a matter of happenstance, it's a matter of strategically planning the accounts that we believe will be winners in the space.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great answer, Steve. Could you put a frame around the growth rates in those 2 segments?","Steven H. Collis","I think we can maybe look at that and invest it out.  I think we've done some of that in the past. But we don't have a framework that we can share right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think that you made a comment earlier around your expectations for LIFO this year and within that comment, Tim, I think you talked about branded price inflation being less and more deflation on the generic side. Can you maybe just talk about what you actually saw in this quarter and then what you are seeing in the marketplace around an increase in competition, as far as the number of generic manufacturers that spend a nice steady state the last couple of years, are you seeing a trend that's perhaps changing a little bit, as we go through the next couple of months?","Tim G. Guttman","In terms of -- and when I speak of LIFO, just let me say that we look at our portfolio of drugs which -- in our mix and in terms of brand, last year we had pretty healthy price increases for brands, slightly above 8%. This year, we're tracking slightly below 8% again for our mix of inventory. So a little bit different, a little bit lower. But on the generic side, we really expect that we'll see some deflation, second half of the year, especially on Lipitor and Zyprexa, the generics when they come off exclusivity, which will help and give us a LIFO benefit. In terms of your second question about suppliers. I mean, last year we also had pretty good price appreciation on the generic side. It's still pretty good, but that's probably off a little bit this year, it's softened a little bit this year, but still pretty healthy.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Steve, just one quick question for you on the oncology side of your business. We know of a number of these pilot programs that have been started by Aetna and United around the way they're paying their physician in trying to take the drug cost out of the equation, are you seeing that impact your business at all? And what are the physicians saying? And if it does take hold, what does that mean longer term, will that change the relationship you have with the physician, where you'll now have a relationship with one of the managed-care companies? How should we think about that?","Steven H. Collis","Well, our strategy with the large payers is really to help them understand how important community oncology is. We believe that it's not only important from a clinical perspective, but we believe that the patient is best served being in the community, and even the payer is best served by those patients being in the community. So our big effort over there is really to help bring the 2 sides together. We have taken a lot of effort at ION, our physician services company, primarily focused on oncology, to help the 2 sides communicate better, have a transparent relationship. And we don't anticipate having a direct relationship with the payer, but we intend to help our customers contract more effectively and more transparently with the payers, and I think we're making a lot of progress there.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","A question for Tim. It looks like, according to my model, your SG&A costs, on a year-over-year basis, declined by about $12 million. Can you describe sort of the cost control process you go through on a quarterly basis and if that's sustainable?","Tim G. Guttman","Sure, David. I mean, when we looked at the year, I mean, we knew and we guided that Q2 and Q3 would be very tough comparisons, I mean, we knew it going into the year. And we put word out through our businesses to really manage expenses this year. And we knew we had to focus in this area. So I mean, we looked hard at managing labor and payroll expense. We looked at outside consulting and services and then this year, too, we've had some good discipline and credit collections, and our bad debts are down. So really, it's all of our businesses focusing on headcount, on making sure they spend money prudently, and that's going to carry forward into quarters 3 and 4.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then if I were to look at like, say, 3% of SG&A in fiscal '11, I'm coming up with like $35 million. So for the incremental acquisition cost with like World Courier group and these other ones, will all-in, that will be more than $35 million? And that's why they'll be -- that's why there was a slight reduction on the operating margin expansion guidance, is that correct?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, in terms of your question, the $35 million, no, I don't think the  all-in -- I mean, we should be under that number. So hopefully that helps you in terms of some guidance but, again, we think we're managing expenses well. We also had the benefit this quarter and we'll have for the rest of the year in terms of SAP being stable, and we're seeing the benefits there. So all in all, I mean, I think what we're saying here is that expense management is offsetting the increases from the special charges and the nonrecurring charges.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And then your merchandise inventory looked like it declined nicely on a sequential basis, maybe leading to an increase in cash flow guidance. That looked nice.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, definitely. Like, David, in my comments, I've mentioned that we've really focused on working capital. All of our businesses are focused on it. Managing AR, managing inventories. So we are seeing some really good reductions in those areas, especially at our ABSG businesses.","Operator","Okay, our last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I guess, just one more question on the Express Medco, I'm obligated at the end here with the -- I think you mentioned in your comments that in some ways you viewed yourself as the primary incumbent on the Express Medco contracts. I guess my question is, are you now happy this is going to an official RFP versus your previous thought pattern over the past 9 months since this deal got announced? Or are you disappointed? Is it because you thought you were the primary incumbent, or are you just indifferent? Just trying to get more color sort of on your view now, the new information versus kind of what you thought previously.","Steven H. Collis","I was actually at a NACDS conference, and I heard one political pundit speak about the election, and they said incumbency is a 4-point advantage, so I was just trying to get that incumbent advantage in there. But that's just my view, I mean, I don't know if anyone else has that view. We did, of course, do more business with Medco than the current wholesaler did with ESR so, you could look at it as an incumbency but, I think, that's just really my view, but we are pleased that this has been decided relatively early in the process. That's very helpful from a planning perspective and, again, it's helped us have a very quick and interesting discussion with ESR. So we think that it's a positive for the industry and we think that, potentially, it could be positive for AmerisourceBergen.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. Now, Steve Collis would like to make some final comments before we go.","Steven H. Collis","We know that it's a very busy day, so we really do appreciate everyone's interest and attention with AmerisourceBergen. I would like to commend my colleague and our acting CFO, Tim Guttman, for his leadership and contribution during this transition period. As you could see, Tim's really done a great job. So to wrap up, ABC thinks this is a really good quarter for us and especially given our tough comps, and we are proud to report good momentum on all fronts at this halfway point in our fiscal year 2012. Thank you again for your attention.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve, and before we go, I'd just like to quickly highlight our upcoming events. On May 17, we'll be presenting at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2012 Health Care Conference in Las Vegas. And on June 6, we will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs 33rd Annual Global Healthcare Conference. That concludes our call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'll turn the conference now over to Ms. Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2013 as well as our quarterly filings for fiscal 2014. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I'm very proud of the results that we are presenting today, and I commend our exceptional associates for the stellar financial and operational performance we reported this year.","Over the last few years, we have examined our industry with fresh eyes, and we have taken bold steps to enhance the role of the wholesaler in the marketplace. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed, our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach, enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing innovative solutions for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. By working creatively to address the current challenges in health care, we seek to drive value for all of our stakeholders, and I believe we have accomplished all of that and then some in our fiscal year 2014.","In financial terms, we exceeded all of our objectives. Our revenues for the full year were up 36%. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 24%, and we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We made substantial investments in our infrastructure, acquired a minority stake in Profarma in Brazil, invested in a specialty joint venture with Profarma, successfully refinanced some of our long-term debt and taking both of our share repurchase programs together, we bought back almost $800 billion -- $800 million of our stock. As a result of our financial stewardship, we enter fiscal 2015 with tremendous financial flexibility.","Our execution was equally strong from an operational perspective. We successfully implemented one of the largest and most complex contracts in the history of the industry ahead of schedule. We opened a new state-of-the-art pharmaceutical distribution center in Florida and expanded and augmented several other facilities, all while improving service levels to all our customers. Furthermore, we have enhanced our relationships with suppliers through the introduction of new solutions and through our participation in the Swiss procurement joint venture.","Fiscal year 2014 was a transformational year for AmerisourceBergen. We substantially strengthened our core business, and we head into the coming year with excellent momentum. Over the last year, our entire industry has transformed itself in an effort to better address the changing needs of the health care landscape. Wholesalers continue to demonstrate that the value we provide to the channel goes well beyond the aggregation of demand and the logistics of getting products from one point to another safely and securely. We help ensure efficient pharmaceutical care and broad access to products, while allowing our customers to focus on caring for their patients.","It is an exciting time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are improving, driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives and successful launches of new brand products. Some of those of new products have the ability to cure previously intractable disease. The R&D pipeline is full of innovative products that hold a potential to make great strides across many disease states. The combination of an advanced therapeutic medicine and expanding access to health care drives growth opportunities and more importantly, meaningfully improves patient lives. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help ensure these products get to market as efficiently as possible and to support efforts to ensure patients have access to these complex new therapy across all sites of care.","Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen. Our performance in the September quarter was exceptional in a year that has been quite strong. On a consolidated basis, our revenues were up 29% and our adjusted EPS was up 36%, driven by strong performance across our businesses and tremendous performance specifically in ABDC. Our working capital trend improved, and we finished the quarter and the year with $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet.","Tim will provide further details, but I want to call out some highlights from our business units. With each passing year, our individual business units become less distinct from one another and instead focus their efforts on collaboratively meeting the needs of suppliers and customers. This is especially true in the specialty area, and our oncology service line offering is a good example of the power of drug company, Specialty Group and our manufacturer services businesses working together. The different perspectives and expertise they each bring to the table creates unique opportunities to deliver value in a fast-changing market, and our suppliers and customers appreciate the ability to achieve a comprehensive solution with AmerisourceBergen. The strength of our results in fiscal 2014 is no doubt a benefit of that collaborative approach.","AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, of course, had a very strong quarter. Revenues were up over 30% even as we anniversary-ed 1 month of the new Walgreens brand business. Solid organic market growth and a contribution from the sale of the new hepatitis C drugs also contributed to ABDC's revenue growth. We brought our new Orlando distribution center online, launched 2 new customer centers and we finished the onboarding of all of Walgreens' generics business. I commend our ABDC associates for the incredible job they did while implementing the largest contract in our history.","It was quite an undertaking, and to have done so ahead of schedule and on budget was laudable. But it was also done in a manner that was not disruptive to our other customers or to the rest of our business. So I truly applaud and appreciate their efforts. We are also pleased with the progress we have made improving our generic sourcing by working with Walgreens, Alliance Boots and the Swiss joint -- JV. These financial benefits were also achieved ahead of schedule and contributed to our September quarter and will continue to ramp as we enter our fiscal 2015.","In addition to the new business that we have brought on, new products launched on our generic private label program, BluePoint, also contributed to our growth. A few overall market trends contributed to our growth as well. Brand price inflation remained strong. The new hepatitis C drugs contributed to both revenue and gross profit dollar growth. Generic price inflation is still an important factor. It was roughly flat on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for the quarter. And finally, market growth is improving across the board, which drove strong performance in our independents, health systems and alternate site customers.","One of the benefits of partnering with AmerisourceBergen is that we work hard to ensure all of our customers have access to the latest life-changing therapies. Whether you are an independent who is qualified to handle sophisticated specialty products or a hospital on the cutting edge of care, our extensive relationships with biotech and other manufacturers helps ensure our customers and their patients have access to these important products. 2014 was a momentous year for ABDC, and the investments we've made in our people and in our infrastructure will help drive both innovative services and greater operational efficiency going forward.","ABSG had solid results in the quarter as strong performance in our plasma and vaccine business offset modest performance in our community oncology business. While reimbursement issues persist for community oncologists, we believe the provider market has stabilized. We believe that oncology care will continue to be provided across various venues, and we continue to invest in new technology and services to ensure that our customers remain in the forefront of the evolution of cancer care.","Our manufacturer services businesses performed well in the quarter, with World Courier coming in especially strong. The unrivaled service offerings in this area are a key driver of value for both our manufacturer and provider customers. The expertise we bring to bear in the regulatory, compliance and policy area, along with our experience in developing patient adherence, reimbursement and assistance programs, is a clear differentiator. The knowledge base, combined with the immense scale of our distribution businesses and our increasingly global reach, make us the ideal partner for those who don't just want to tackle current challenges but see greater opportunities on the horizon.","One of the most gratifying things about the performance we had in fiscal 2014 is that we meaningfully expanded our ability to shape health care delivery and to positively impact the communities we serve. We have the means not only to continue to make important investments in our business, but also to launch and fund the AmerisourceBergen Foundation. This new foundation will primarily support 501(c)(3) organizations that address the needs of the patients we serve. We will formally launch the foundation over the next few months.","From a business operations perspective, we have launched AmerisourceBergen Global Manufacturer Services GmbH in Bern, Switzerland or AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, a new entity that represents an important step to support global manufacturer relations and our commercialization strategy. Peyton Howell, our President of Global Supply Chain and Manufacturer Services, has moved to Bern, and she and her team are developing and implementing the next generation of commercialization services for pharmaceutical manufacturers.","With the dramatic changes in the pharmaceutical manufacturer landscape, AmerisourceBergen Switzerland is positioned to function as an intermediary of all types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, fostering strategic relationships and focusing on specific new value-added activities. This new business will provide data analytics and market intelligence to insist manufacturers -- to assist manufacturers with their supply chain effectiveness and will serve as a platform to manage and grow ProGenerics, our proprietary generics formulary, and other global generic programs. ABC Swiss co represents a critical step in the process of expanding on international presence while improving the services we offer our partners.","As we have previously disclosed, we are nearing the completion of our national distribution center in Columbus, Ohio and expect it to be fully operational by the end of the calendar year. This new facility will streamline certain branded manufacturer contracts by providing a single ship-to point for products for manufacturers who wish to utilize the service. Through integration with our SAP infrastructure and other advanced warehouse management and materials handling tools, it also enables us to redistribute products within our network more efficiently and support our future growth.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2015 and beyond, we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our long-term goals. We aim to grow revenues with the markets, grow adjusted EPS in the mid-teens, earn a return on invested capital that exceeds our weighted average cost of capital, generate free cash flow that exceeds net income and return a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We will continue to be excellent stewards of capital and redeploy it wisely to both grow our business and enhance shareholder returns.","We have a strong track record of investing in assets and internal projects that add value to our business and improve our service offering to manufacturers and providers. We will continue to expand those efforts, both in the U.S. market and internationally. We remain keenly focused on the pharmaceutical services space, which we believe has excellent opportunities for growth in the years ahead and ample opportunities for AmerisourceBergen to continue to differentiate itself.","Turning to fiscal 2015 specifically. We expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue, while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. We expect the contribution from generic inflation to be flat year-over-year and for community oncology to be relatively flat for the year. Operating margins will be pressured as we launch Swiss co and the national distribution center. And similar to 2014, the fast-growing hepatitis C products will contribute gross profit dollars but at a lower margin. We will, of course, continue to benefit from having a full year of the generic business from Walgreens, and the benefits from the Swiss procurement JV will continue to ramp into fiscal 2015.","Tim will provide greater detail, but in summary, on a consolidated basis, we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%; we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continued operations growth in the range of 10% to 13%; free cash flow generation in the range of $1.04 -- $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion; and including both of our share repurchase programs, we expect to purchase $800 million of our shares. Following our stellar performance in fiscal 2014, we enter 2015 with good momentum, and we are exceptionally well-positioned to meet our financial and operational objectives going forward.","One final word about fiscal 2014. As I look back over the year, I'm of course, pleased with our outstanding financial and operational performance. I'm even more pleased, however, with how we achieved it. Through bold thinking and unmatched execution, we established unprecedented ways to create value for all of our stakeholders. We have great partners in Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and our innovative long-term strategic relationship has driven tremendous value for all 3 partners, with more to come in the years ahead. Our success in these areas gives me great confidence that we will continue to make vital and differentiated contributions to the marketplace and thereby provide excellent returns to our shareholders while continuing to provide increasing value to our customers.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Steve mentioned, we wrapped up a historic year at ABC as our organization successfully onboarded our largest customer, Walgreens. We are very proud of our organization as we outperformed all of our key financial targets we established at the beginning of the year. We did this while managing through significant change, including heavy investing in our infrastructure. Even more important, we did this without negatively impacting our customer service levels. Again, we want to thank the ABC organization for all of the extra effort made this year.","Before I start my detailed review, let me cover a few high-level comments. My remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results from continuing operations. In our press release, we included a reconciling table between GAAP and adjusted results, where we've highlighted the specific items that we excluded. We will cover 2 of these excluded items as I work through recapping our September results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the fourth quarter ended September 2014 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted.","I have 3 main items to cover this morning. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. The third item, I will wrap up my prepared comments, covering our fiscal '15 expectations.","With that, let's start the detailed September quarter review. Beginning with the top line. Revenues were $31.6 billion, up 29%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment was responsible for the strong overall revenue growth, consistent with the prior 3 quarters. Excluding the Walgreens growth, our consolidated revenues increased nearly 9%. Roughly 2\/3 of this revenue growth was the result of the new hepatitis C brand drugs. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 29% to $927 million. The growth was due to strong performance at our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, driven by better-than-expected revenue growth on both the brand and generic side.","Operating expenses. Consistent with previous quarters, this fiscal year, we had an increase in expense to support the onboarding of the Walgreens business at our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Additionally, we had an increase in employee incentive compensation due to our outperformance. We also expensed the initial contribution made to establish an ABC tax-exempt charitable foundation. Because of these specific items and the normal seasonality of the September quarter having higher expenses, our total operating expenses increased 27% to $503 million.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $424 million, up $98 million or a very strong 30%. This quarter marked the highest growth of the fiscal year. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, up 1 basis point.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net was about $15.5 million, down about 17%, mostly due to refinancing a portion of our debt that we completed back in May. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 37.5% for the current quarter. This brought us right in line at 38% for the full year.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 36% to $1.10, driven by exceptionally strong organic operating income growth. Our adjusted diluted share count was 231 million shares, down about 2%. It's important to highlight that this share count excludes both the impact from shares repurchased under our special share authorization and the dilutive impact of the warrants. I would refer you to our press release where we have included a new reconciling table that highlights the calculation of our adjusted diluted share count.","Let me switch and cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants increased to approximately $1.1 billion as of September 30. This resulted in a warrant expense in the quarter of $156 million. Both of these amounts increased as a result of ABC's higher share price at September 30 compared to June 30.","LIFO. This quarter, we completed our annual LIFO calculation. Consequently, we recorded LIFO expense of about $54 million, to reach a full year LIFO expense of $348 million, which is higher than last year. Brand price inflation at just under 12% and inventory mix are typically key drivers of our annual LIFO expense. However, this year, we did not have the same level of generic drug deflation we had in prior -- in the prior fiscal year due to the pricing environment as well as the lack of drugs coming off of exclusivity. These 2 factors contributed to our year-over-year LIFO expense increase.","Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $31 billion, up 29%. As mentioned earlier by Steve, drug company led the way with a 33% revenue increase. In the quarter, we anniversary-ed the start of the Walgreens contract. Consequently, we only had 2 months of incremental brand revenues in addition to the new generics business. Our revenues in our core drug business continue to be better than expected, driven primarily by 3 items: increased sales to our largest customer, the new -- the 2 new hepatitis C brand drugs and the impact from a continued strong manufacturer pricing environment.","On the generic side, we had solid growth in our ProGenerics program, with revenues growing as a percentage in the low teens. And as a reminder, the Walgreens generic business does not run through our ProGenerics business line.","Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of about 13%. We continued to see very good revenue growth in oral oncology, plasma and ophthalmology. ICS, our third-party logistics business, also had very good revenue growth. These sales growth percentages for the drug company and for specialty are before intersegment eliminations, consistent with how we've reported these growth rates in the past.","Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was about $790 million, up $185 million or about 31%. Drug company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase as a result of their high revenue growth. During the quarter, generic price appreciation was better than we previously expected and also contributed to segment results. Operating expenses were $404 million and were up about 31%. Similar to prior quarters this fiscal year, the expense increase was primarily due to supporting the segment's significant volume growth.","Additionally, this quarter, to finish the Walgreens implementation by September 30, we supplemented our full-time staff with temporary resources in our distribution centers. Also, we are operating 2 distribution centers in Florida which added extra cost in the September quarter. We will transition all of this Florida customer business to our new DC in early fiscal '15. Adjusted segment operating income was $386 million and up 31%, driven by the outstanding performance of our drug company, which includes successfully onboarding the Walgreens business faster than anticipated.","We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services and World Courier. In the quarter, the segment revenues increased $134 million or about 26% to $652 million. Our consulting business had revenue growth of about 20%. Our TheraCom distribution business, which is within consulting, drove most of this growth. A few of the key drugs they distribute continue to gain market share. Switching to World Courier, their revenue growth was positively impacted from an adjustment where we corrected intercompany revenues last fiscal year in Q4 '13. Excluding this adjustment, World Courier's revenue increase this quarter was about 8.5%, driven primarily by higher volumes. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $37 million, with growth of about 25%, due primarily to the record performance of World Courier.","This completes our segment review. Let me switch gears and cover a few key fiscal '14 financial metrics. Overall, we did very well, meeting or exceeding our revised guidance targets. Revenue, on a full year basis, our growth was 36%. Excluding the positive impact from our Walgreens contract, our revenues were up 8%. The new hepatitis C brand drugs accounted for roughly half of this revenue growth. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 28% of our total revenues in fiscal '14.","Our specialty business finished the year at nearly $20 billion, with revenue growth of about 11%, led by ASD, Besse Medical and ICS. These 3 businesses accounted for about 90% of the total dollar increase. Our oncology supply business was essentially flat for the year, as expected, due to the community oncology environment and also brand-to-generic conversions.","Our adjusted operating income increased a stellar 21% to $1.56 billion. Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.30%, a decrease of 17 basis points. This margin was better than what we originally expected, and it also included the negative effect of a few basis points from the lower-margin new hepatitis C brand drugs.","EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $3.97, up 24%, mostly due to our strong organic operating income growth and very little from share repurchases.","Cash flow. We are extremely pleased with the progress we made in this area. We finished well above our revised expectation of $1.2 billion for free cash flow. The positive impact from a higher generic revenue mix as well as our drug company operations group effectively managing inventory level, helped drive outperformance in this area.","And finally, share repurchases. Under our regular share repurchase program, we purchased $538 million of stock, which was above our original guidance. Under our special share repurchase program, we continue to make steady progress. This program is used specifically to offset anticipated warrant dilution. We have repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares or $252 million through September 30. Combined with our hedging program, we've made good progress toward offsetting as much of the expected warrant dilution as is economically feasible.","Now let's turn to fiscal '15 expectations. Revenues. We expect consolidated revenue growth in the 7% to 8% range. We expect higher revenue from our largest customer, Walgreens, mostly as a result of generic distribution being ramped at a full run rate for our entire fiscal 2015. Just the incremental generics business will represent about 2% of our growth. This growth is also expected to come from the following categories: new brand drugs, like those that treat hepatitis C; overall script and volume growth from an improving U.S. economy and a positive contribution from health care reform; and finally, continued growth in our specialty business. Our revenue growth will be somewhat dampened due to a previously disclosed customer loss and meaningful brand-to-generic conversions.","Gross profit. Our gross profit dollars will clearly be up. We will have a full year benefit from both Walgreens generics and the procurement joint venture. We also expect a better generic launch schedule than we saw in fiscal '14. In terms of key launches, we now expect that generic Nexium will be delayed and will now launch in June 2015. This means we won't have the full 6 months of exclusivity in this fiscal year. Our working assumption for generic price inflation is that the dollar contribution will be relatively flat in fiscal '15. Headwinds in the gross profit area include contract renewal, certain customer losses and lower growth in specialty due to continued reimbursement pressure and maturing generic oncology drugs and no offsetting new oncology generic launches.","Operating expenses. We expect year-over-year dollar growth as a percentage to be in the high single digits. The increase is driven primarily from 3 key areas. One, we will be incurring a full year of direct costs associated with supporting the Walgreens business, primarily distribution center labor expense and delivery; two, we have expenses directly associated with a few key initiatives, like the national distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and the startup of our Swiss business and continued investment in our IT infrastructure, especially around EDI, security and a track and trace system -- these IT expenses are required to scale and support our business going forward; and finally, three, we have normal run-of-the-business increases, such as compensation, incentive and health care costs. The expenses that I highlighted in these first 2 categories, full year of Walgreens distribution and the new initiatives, account for approximately 60% of the overall dollar operating expense increase.","Operating income. For fiscal '15, we expect our year-over-year dollar growth to be 8% to 10%, driven primarily by the drug company. Our fiscal '15 growth moderates somewhat by a few items: phasing in of the national distribution center; expenses coming faster than gross profit; fairly high incremental operating expenses associated with our new Swiss business; and lower growth in our specialty business.","Switching to operating margin. We expect our margin in basis points to be relatively flat to up slightly in fiscal '15. Our margin will be impacted by the rate of growth of our 2 largest customers; timing of brand-to-generic conversions, like Nexium; and the continued ramp of hepatitis C product revenue. These 3 items can move our margin up or down by several basis points and can make pegging of margin goals difficult.","Interest expense. Our interest expense is expected to decrease slightly due to a stronger cash position and also refinancing a portion of our debt last year.","Tax rate. Through our new business initiatives, we expect to see our adjusted tax rate decrease to about 37% for the full year.","Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes $400 million in regular share repurchases. Importantly, with our anticipated share price and expected level of exercises, we don't expect our adjusted diluted share count to decrease much, just about 1%.","Adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.50, an increase of 10% to 13%. We expect our adjusted EPS to be greater in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half due to the phasing of generic price appreciation, similar to what we've experienced the last 2 years and also the generic launch calendar. An item of note: our first fiscal quarter typically has the lowest level of brand and generic price appreciation of our 4 quarters.","Switching over to cash flow. CapEx is expected to be approximately $300 million. Given the improved cash outlook for ABC, we believe this is the right time to further invest in our core drug business and specifically, our distribution center network. About 1\/3 of our CapEx spend is slated for distribution center capacity and automation improvement. As always, we expect a good return on these infrastructure investments.","Free cash flow. We expect to have an excellent year in terms of free cash flow due to higher generic revenues and the fact that generics have beneficial working capital metrics. Free cash flow will be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, and it also includes the expected benefit from rightsizing our inventory now that we've reached the full rollout of the Walgreens business. In addition to the regular share repurchases I highlighted before, we also expect to use about $400 million to continue to offset future warrant dilution through our special share repurchase program.","In summary, I know that my comments today were longer than usual due to covering the quarter, year-end and also '15 guidance, so thank you for your attention. Our commitment: we will continue to make the right investments in our business and allocate our capital thoughtfully to ensure long-term success. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC.","Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Tim. We'll now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, John.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made. I mean, the company obviously has been through a lot of positive transition here in the last 18 months. And now that you've kind of emerged from it, as you sit back, you look at the cash flow generation and the strength of the balance sheet, do you feel like you're at a -- in a position now where you can start to think more strategically? Or do you kind of take a breath and just kind of focus on getting the operations right? I mean, how do think about capital deployment from here?","Steven H. Collis","Glen, thanks for the comments. I'll start off and then let Tim comment. I mean, obviously, we went through a very significant operational hurdle again. As we pointed out, both Tim and I pointed out, I think we came through it very strong, not only for our Walgreens customers, but for all of our customers. We have more inventory. I mean, in 26 of our -- we have 26 distribution centers -- 23 of them had some level of automation improvement, streamlining, new equipment coming in. So we really had significant work to do. The cash flow came in strong the last couple of quarters. Our balance sheet is strong. But again, we're doing some $400 million a day in sales, so you need to look at it in terms of that context. But clearly, our first prize has always been to find the right type of acquisition. We're very encouraged by the success of World Courier. World Courier has also given us a lot of, I'd say, organizational muscle, as we look at dealing with things like exchange control and FCPA, the treasury issues, the tax issues. So it's -- I think we really are in a good position. And we also are very excited about our WBAD and the new AmerisourceBergen Switzerland office. That really gives us a good foray into global operations. So definitely, we, in a way, feel like the team is just getting started and we've got lots of significant opportunities.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I could follow-up with a question for Tim. I mean, appreciate all the detail you gave with respect to fiscal '15. But within your sort of comments, I think you mentioned that the benefit from annualizing the Walgreens generics business on your top line would be about a 2% contribution. And so when I look within the broader context of your 10% to 13% EPS growth in the guidance, is it fair to say that just the annualized benefit of Walgreens probably accounts for about 1\/3 of that and the other 2\/3 being more the organic growth, taking into consideration all the other headwinds and tailwinds you mentioned?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Thanks, Glen. No, I -- we definitely have a benefit next year of ramping up and having the generics at a full run rate. So again, I think the other thing, too, that you have to consider is that we're going to have that full run rate from the procurement joint venture next year. So I mean, I think it's a combination of things that drive -- I mean, I really don't want to parse out the growth. I mean, I think, again, it's kind of the big 3: having generics, having the joint venture, and a better generic launch year -- all kind of drive the margin a little bit up and better operating income. And I guess, if I can, I just like to go back and talk about your first question a little bit too, is -- clearly, it's top of mind. We want to make sure that as our cash improves, we have an overhang from the warrants. And again, we'll look opportunistically. Steve talked about being committed to long-term earnings growth. That's a big consideration for ABC. So having those warrants, as we get closer to those expected exercise dates, we want to make sure we use our cash thoughtfully to offset those -- offset that dilution. We're committed to that.","Operator","And that's from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, I guess, a follow-up around one of Glen's questions around the procurement platform. I guess, the first one, more quantitative, see if I can ask this a different way. I mean, curious if you could share anything more specific, Tim, on what's factored into guidance from the better purchasing. It's been over a year now, and I know this is an important arrangement, big swing factor to numbers. So I'm curious if you could just give us any more clarity around what the contribution is that's baked in. And then, I guess, on the qualitative side, there has been some concern in the marketplace that the original synergy expectations from these larger generic purchasing platforms might not actually be playing out in the marketplace as many of the generic manufacturers aren't really able to meet the demand needed to drive the volume-based savings originally thought of. Just curious if you guys had any updated perspectives on that as well.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Bob, I'll take the first one since you directed it over here. Quantitative, no, I appreciate the question. Again, it's very sensitive. I mean, we're real pleased with where we're at. We've had progression each quarter in '14 in terms of what we've seen from the procurement joint venture. We're at a good jumping-off point now going into '15. Again, pretty much in line with what we expected way back when, when we kind of announced the deal in terms of savings as a percentage. So I don't think we want to get too fine on the dollar contribution because of competitive reasons.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. I mean, I'll just say that if you look at some of the changes that have occurred in the manufacturer generic landscape, I mean, with the big trading partners we have there, I mean, enormous changes since we announced our transaction. And again, we think that the 3 partners scale up very well to these global multinational companies with increasingly sophisticated supply chain, regulatory requirements, pricing requirements, pressures from austerity programs in different markets. So we focused at first on generics. There's no reason -- you look at the caliber of the people that are involved in WBAD and -- from both Alliance Boots and Walgreens side and the people that we are contributing, I mean Peyton's experience with commercialization, all of these should be assets for the platform. So we are bullish on where this could be in the short, medium and long term.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess just a quick follow-up would be, we've seen the retailers face some pressures both from inflation and reimbursement rate pressure. I'm just curious if there's any impact or any thought around potential changes with your agreement with Walgreens relative to some of the moving pieces in the landscape.","Steven H. Collis","Every customer we are able to look at differently. We model on overall profitability. Certainly, we think that the reimbursement -- the price increases is more of a reimbursement issue than a procurement issue. To get the reimbursement tables adjusted quicker in this day and age is certainly a priority. We have seen a broader price inflation trend. Obviously, we listened to the calls in the last day or 2, and this is a theme that is clearly on top of mind. We think that it's -- there's some very valid drivers as to why price increases are occurring. We're expecting -- we had a very good year with price increases this year, better than we expected, and we're expecting to at least hold steady for next year. So I would say that's a significant expectation, that price increases will continue.","Operator","That's from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions, first on generic inflation. So just to clarify, Steve, Walgreen on their call said that they expect low single-digit inflation. So how does your comment resonate with theirs? Do you assume a similar level of increases?","Steven H. Collis","Well, again, we really manage 2 big type of generics -- our ProGen formulary, which we have, obviously, formulary control over, and that's a lot what our independents and other customer base -- other customer segments, including health systems, tap into. We also then hold -- handle our customer generic files. And that -- certainly, Walgreens is foremost in that category, very significant contract generic acquirer. So we sometimes have different contract terms, et cetera, within ProGen and with the other generic sector. So I don't think that those 2 statements are mutually exclusive. We -- and again, sometimes, you have to look at the detail of these statements. Is it -- are we talking about the branded environment? Are we talking about the generic environment solely? We do expect that there still is -- the vast majority of products are subject to price deterioration in the generic market. We believe some 70% to 80% of the products will experience some level of deflation, which has been the typical model. So I think you also have to look at where the fiscal years lie. We're a September year obviously. There's some significant difference depending on where people's fiscal years lie, measurement periods, et cetera. But Tim, I can see you want to answer this question.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. No, I would just add, Ricky, that what we forecast -- I mean, Steve, you hit it. Again what we forecast is specific to us and the manufacturers we use and inventory levels. We're really not trying to forecast the rate in the market. I think we'll stay consistent with what we said last quarter, is that we're -- for our basket of generics, we've seen an increase, slightly positive inflation this year versus maybe slightly negative kind of the period before. So it's changed. But that's all I would add, Steve.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. I mean, obviously, the cash flow generation guidance is quite impressive. I think in -- you talked about some inventory management. Should we assume, going forward, that this is kind of like a new level in how we model cash flow generation for ABC for the longer term? Or is this just kind of, like, a 1-year phenomenon?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. No, great question, Ricky. I'd tell you we're really proud of our cash -- I mean, our cash conversion cycle. With all the complexity this year in managing through our cash conversion cycle, our working -- or kind of our net working capital days only increased 1 day between '14 and '13. So really, really hats off to our drug company. But I would say in '15, there are probably 2 -- there probably are some items positively impacting that won't repeat. Again, kind of bringing on generics, finishing up the Walgreens kind of build and getting to a run rate and then also rightsizing our inventory, there's some benefit in there. But I would say that, going forward, with a healthy generic mix, we expect -- we always expect our free cash flow to be above net income and to increase every year.","Operator","And that's from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You just answered it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So thinking back 18 months ago when you announced the agreement, I know you talked to being able to maintain your long-term growth target, I think 15%, over a multiyear period. And I guess we've seen multiple years now with bringing brand on and generic on from the distribution side and now this year, with the ramp of the sourcing benefits. As you look out, is there a further ramp that this agreement continues to drive? Is there a significant ramp from sourcing itself? How do you think about continuing to drive the 15%?","Steven H. Collis","I mean, there's really -- I mean, in Dave Yost's time, we'd talk about growing revenue with probably a pretty robust top line growth. We'd talk about operating margin leverage, and we'd talk about capital deployment, share buybacks. Obviously, the stock multiple has increased. So some of those have changed, but we're still committed to that sort of a growth range in the long term. It's certainly how we think about our compensation plans, our long-term incentive plans. And we've been proud of our track record. If you look at the compound annual growth rate and EPS since 2001, we've really done a great job in that range, maybe a couple of points higher. I think the early years were driven by fee for service and even higher organic growth rates. We're trying to do some things internationally, where the growth rates aren't as high. But we are focused on the specialty area, where you should see higher organic growth rates. So we've added a lot of complexity to our business, but we think that's very consistent with the demands of our stakeholders, including manufacturers and providers. So we're not backing off those hurdles or those targets, whichever one you want to use.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it sounds like you have a lot of tools. But the tool -- the piece of this that came from the agreement with WBAD, Walgreens, et cetera, may be running its course?","Steven H. Collis","Well, we -- if you look at our portfolio -- I think when I became CEO and before that, for 2 years, was President of the drug company, we were really missing that big chain segment, and we are sincerely proud to have partnered with Walgreens. It's been a great partnership. We're looking forward to really the completion of Walgreens Boots Alliance next year. We think that, that's going to be -- it really increased the opportunities and the focus that the 3 of us have together -- I guess it will be the 2 of us have together. And we are looking forward also to other synergies that we can drive on the brand side, on international specialty, working together with World Courier. These opportunities we haven't fully explored yet, which we think will be very fruitful in the year ahead -- years ahead. But this is -- also, Walgreens organic growth rates have been a nice boost to our revenues, coming in ahead this year of what we expected.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And quickly, you mentioned that generic inflation will be flat in your assumption. If you have flat inflation on your book, does that mean that the impact to incremental benefits from inflation would be relatively small as compared to when you were going from deflation to inflation?","Steven H. Collis","If they were -- if we are -- I guess, if the numbers came in higher than we expected, there would be a benefit as it did this year. But I'll let Tim comment.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. Just, Eric, I mean, we talked about the dollar contribution being essentially flat. And if it's better, it moves us up in the range. If it's worse, but we -- that's why we have a range. I would just say that we think we're being appropriately right here in terms of our working assumption, and it's an area that's always difficult to predict and also to know when it's going to happen. So we think we're kind of going into this, into '15 with the right guidance.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you have to refill that each year? So if you had 5%, you get another 5% that simply refills what you saw the prior year?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes.","Steven H. Collis","Yes.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, just quickly on guidance. But not surprisingly, timing of Nexium launch and generic pricing inflation are 2 of the big swing factors to hit earnings it seems. So excluding those, what are the key variables?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. I would say one of the bigger ones out there that we haven't really talked about, we're still in a holding pattern on, it's still an active process, is the DoD. We talked about that last quarter. There should be notification the end of the year. That's clearly one. And I would just say the other swing factors would be just some of the hep C and the uptake and having a new drug out there versus the old drug. Just some of those -- some of the contributions we made in that area, too, could move us up or down in the range.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What's the assumption on DoD in the current guidance then?","Tim G. Guttman","Well, the current guidance is like -- again, we have a piece of the contract. We've factored in that we retain our piece, that we have at a lower margin.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just switching gears. You mentioned health reform initiatives as a positive contributor a couple of times in the prepared remarks. So could you just elaborate a little bit more as to how you're thinking about health reform and how much weight you're giving it in fiscal '15?","Steven H. Collis","We note that there's some 8 million to 9 million, maybe as many as 10 million new patients being covered through exchanges and other mechanisms. That definitely is driving growth. There could be more on Medicaid programs. There's some evidence that our independent customers have disproportionate market share there, but it's overall good for the market. Look, we -- the new data coming out from the most established reporting companies will show you that the market is very robust. We've seen more robust top line growth than we've seen before. However, 1 product has been more significant to that growth than probably the patient attrition that we've seen. So it's -- again, this is a great industry to be a part of. I was participating last week in the international wholesaler federation meeting, and the U.S. market is still the envy of the rest of the world. This is a wonderful market to have most of our business be resident in.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. I would just jump in and say that our working assumption is a pretty modest increase. We always -- when we talk health care reform, we always say the economy too because it's hard to really tell what's driving script growth. I mean, it's definitely up. We're seeing a benefit, but it's hard to say what's causing it. But for '15 in our growth assumption for revenue, we probably have 0.5% kind of factored in there, excluding those hepatitis C drugs. We kind of carve those out and do a separate assumption on those.","Operator","And we'll go to Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a question, Tim, to start with, around the tax rate. If I do the math, it looks like every 100 basis point reduction is about $0.07, and I would assume that, based on your commentary, some of this is because of moving some of the operations over to Switzerland. Is there incremental opportunity over the next couple of years to continue to bring that tax rate down?","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Lisa. Yes, I would -- let me just comment that we -- as Steve mentioned, we're thrilled that Peyton and her family have moved over to start this business. There is a benefit in our tax rate from that. But also, we're seeing a benefit from not only that, but BluePoint, our private label, is giving us a little bit of an advantage and also World Courier. But to get to the main point, yes, I do think it's an area of focus. It's a pretty big expense for ABC, and we're being very thoughtful about how to look at our tax rate going forward.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then thinking about BluePoint. Can you give us any incremental color around BluePoint? So is it being run out of Switzerland? What are some of the opportunities there? How do you anticipate that, that business will grow over the next couple of years? And furthermore, are you actually manufacturing the product? Or is this more of a repackaging type of operation?","Steven H. Collis","Well, it's definitely more of a repackaging, relabeling, importation, demand aggregation. There's a well-established precedent in the wholesaler market in the U.S., and we thought this was a great opportunity for some of the x U.S. suppliers to aggregate demand. It's been well received in the marketplace, good adoption by our customers. We've really had this in the works for a couple of years, but launched this year. But our repackaging facility is really done out of Ireland, and that was planned before. But certainly, having the group in Bern helped coordinate with Peyton, and we actually had this in the works before we went into the WBAD partnership. So it's definitely a growth driver for us and one that we'll carry on focusing on.","Barbara A. Brungess","Steve, do you have some...","Steven H. Collis","Yes. Thanks, everyone, for your time. I know it was an extremely busy day today. But let me just conclude our discussions for today by really reiterating that ABC is in terrific shape. Our teamwork and confidence that maybe I haven't touched on enough today because I'm just so proud of where we are as a company, our ability to take on new challenges and opportunities, I believe, has never been higher. At all levels, we thrive on working together as we meet the challenges and opportunities the markets are presenting to us. We really feel that we're just getting started, and you can look forward to great things to come from the AmerisourceBergen team.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Keri Mattox, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2017 third quarter financial results. I'm Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen, and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today's call, we also will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in today's press release as well as on our website.

We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss our third quarter results and AmerisourceBergen's continued execution. Revenues were up 5% to $38.7 billion and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.43, an increase of 4% compared to the previous fiscal year period. While the healthcare market remains challenging and our operating income was down 5% as product pricing continued to impact market performance. As a result of our third quarter performance, we are updating aspects of our fiscal year 2017 financial guidance including tightening adjusted diluted EPS range, as we feel confident moving into the last quarter of the fiscal year.","As we think about AmerisourceBergen moving forward, I want to take a moment to bring my comments on today's call. This morning, my focus will be on the structure of our business, the strategic drivers of our recently announced corporate organization, and how we feel we are best positioning AmerisourceBergen for long-term growth and value creation. As we've discussed on recent quarterly calls, we believe AmerisourceBergen has a solid differentiated foundation, one that sets us apart from others in the industry, enables us to execute in a challenging healthcare environment, helps us support and accelerate growth for our customers, and ultimately enhances patient access to quality healthcare.","We are building on that foundation and evolving AmerisourceBergen. Our corporate reorganization announcement in June marked the most transformative change for our company since the 2001 merger that created AmerisourceBergen. Simply put, we are now one AmerisourceBergen. You might ask what does this reorganization really mean? How does it change AmerisourceBergen? The answer is this. As part of our focus on being innovative in the services and solutions we provide our customers, both upstream and downstream, we are aligning our businesses to most effectively serve them in a changing healthcare market.","We are optimizing AmerisourceBergen for new opportunities. The updated structure continues to mirror our existing financial reporting structure, and creates two new primary groups to enable more seamless customer engagement and supports growth for the organization. The first group is pharmaceutical distribution and strategic global sourcing, which combines our industry-leading distribution services and their shared leadership structure, creating a more cohesive experience for our customers and expanding on our operational excellence.","This group is by far our largest at AmerisourceBergen with approximately $145 billion in annual revenue based on its current run rate and it's headed up by Bob Mauch. Bob has done an excellent job leading our drug company, and we're excited for him to be in this new expanded role. Another long time key contributor to AmerisourceBergen's success, Peyton Howell is working with Bob to head up health systems, physician practices, and strategic held solutions within the segment.","You may note that ABSG will no longer be its own separate operating segment. This was a strategic choice, but in no way diminishes the importance of this business. On the contrary, given the critical role of specialty in the healthcare landscape, our strong leadership in this space and its compelling drug profile, we believe specialty is core to what we do across all of AmerisourceBergen. As a result, we are taking a comprehensive full spectrum approach to maintaining and growing our strong leadership in the specialty distribution and services of specialty pharmaceuticals.","This broader, more strategic and customer-facing approach to pharmaceutical distribution and strategic global sourcing positions AmerisourceBergen to capture market opportunities more effectively. For example, we see a compelling future opportunity for growth in biosimilars, and we anticipate that we'll continue to drive strong growth in specialty. IMS is projecting both of these areas to outpace the growth of the overall U.S. pharma market over the next five years, and we look forward to expanding our leadership position in that space.","The second group created by our corporate reorganization is global commercialization services and animal health, led by Jim Cleary, who has done a wonderful job leading MWI Animal Health. This group expands the impact of our commercialization solutions and demand creation capabilities to create a more integrated offering for our pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. This part of our business includes MWI, World Courier and our consulting businesses, all fast-growing, high-value and high-margin business units.","Our consistent leadership has grown the group to now contributing 20% of our operating income, despite totaling only 4% of our overall revenues. This continues to be a strong growth driver and area of opportunity for AmerisourceBergen. Additionally, this is an area of strategic IP and systems investments as we work to optimize our customer integration opportunities, and it's also a top priority area for expansion through tuck-in acquisitions and positions us for continued strong execution in high-growth markets.","I think it's important to note that Bob, Peyton and Jim have all come to us via strategic acquisitions and have thrived at AmerisourceBergen. I believe it is no coincidence, as our corporate culture embraces an entrepreneurial, customer-focused and team-oriented leadership style. I am proud that AmerisourceBergen is the home where these world-class executives have chosen to build their careers.","It's been about a month since we introduced this reorganization, and the response from our customers and associates has been very positive. There is a great deal of excitement around the opportunity to transform our business, and we are driving forward with planning and integration now. The process will take several months, and we will continue to provide you with updates as to our progress. We are confident that the outcomes will include an important evolution of our business, significant benefits for our customers, and enhanced healthcare access for the patients we serve. This internal reorganization is also about positioning AmerisourceBergen externally to most strategically, dynamically and successfully address healthcare market forces.","Despite today's challenging healthcare environment, AmerisourceBergen has a strong track record of execution. We also have a clearly defined strategic focus on the U.S. pharmaceutical market, where we continue to see growth, strong patient demographics, increasing efficiency, and value placed on outcomes-based treatments. Additionally, as I've just discussed, our corporate reorganization shows that customer accessibility and integration are critical drivers of our success.","We also know that this is a time of ever-changing healthcare market dynamics and that AmerisourceBergen is well-positioned to navigate them. We have the best customer base in the industry, and how those customers do business is evolving. Our services and solutions integrate into our customer businesses to drive and accelerate growth. For example, I just returned from ThoughtSpot, our annual conference and tradeshow, hosted by Good Neighbor Pharmacy in Las Vegas. This four-day event for independent community pharmacies draws 5,000 attendees, providing them with practical tools and clinical education sessions to enable them to diversify their revenue stream and optimize their core business.","The meeting is an interactive venue for independent pharmacists to connect with ABC associates, PRxO Generics manufacturers, legislators, industry experts and their peers, all to help them build a better business, find growth opportunities, and maintain their status as a preferred healthcare destination in their community. Despite formidable challenges, the independent pharmacists at ThoughtSpot were confident in their role as crucial healthcare providers for patients and continue to be truly resilient entrepreneurs.","The event not only allowed us to engage with our customers but also gather honest feedback on what we are doing well and where we can do better. What we heard is that customers view AmerisourceBergen as a trusted adviser, and their voice and ears outside the pharmacy as they look to us to keep them informed and empowered and work on their behalf as legislative actions develop, as we have done for decades. Our goals are aligned with these key customers, and we are committed to helping them serve their patients while expanding, evolving, and growing their businesses, continuing, as customers put it, to be problem solvers for them. When our customers are successful, AmerisourceBergen is successful.","At ThoughtSpot, we also fully unveiled and showcased ABC Order and how this intuitive platform, which was created by pharmacists for pharmacists, is increasing the efficiency of their daily ordering process. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers are telling us that this allows them to spend more time with their patients and is improving their overall business. Full rollout of the streamlined and enhanced ordering platform is now underway, and feedback has been overwhelmingly and strongly positive.","The Elevate Provider Network was also highlighted at ThoughtSpot. Two years after the full launch of our bolstered program, Elevate is helping independent pharmacies increase profitability through enhanced patient care and adherence, improve business practices, and leverage centralized data to support reimbursement discussions with payers.","Another example of how we are working hand in hand with our customers is in our commercialization services group. Here we provide an ever-growing range of offerings around pharmaceutical product launch services. We believe that AmerisourceBergen is the leader and partner of choice for the commercial launch of new products. We provide the broadest spectrum of manufactured services and are always building on our long legacy of support and success in this area. In fact, in 2017, we've helped our manufacturer customers successfully launch many new products across several indications in the immuno-oncology space.","Through an integrated approach, we've been able to ensure access to these life-saving medications with outcomes-based solutions demonstrating value propositions for payer coverage, distribution service across all types of care, and reimbursement and clinical solutions to support patient access and benefits. In addition to our innovative solutions and diverse customer base, we're also strategically positioned in our marketplace.","AmerisourceBergen continues to invest in our business to expand our leading-edge capabilities. We are extremely efficient. As of today's call, four of our seven new distribution centers are online, enabling AmerisourceBergen to serve our customers with greater levels of automation than ever. Overall, our pharma distribution network provides critical high-value services, delivering to more than 30,000 sites by the next morning with greater than 99.98% order accuracy.","Additionally, we have developed the ability to operate in a highly regulated market. AmerisourceBergen thrives on the complexity of healthcare. We grow by finding new, more efficient ways to help our customers navigate that complexity successfully, and we do it while earning extremely big compensation for the value we provide, and we are always working with our customers on the front line of delivering healthcare services.","The relationships we build with our customers, and that they in turn build with patients are key. The quality of the patient care and health outcome is dependent upon that relationship. We, along with our customers, are a critical part of that healthcare continuum.","Finally, against the backdrop of the ever-changing healthcare market dynamics, AmerisourceBergen is well-positioned to realize new opportunities from a strategic partnership with Walgreens, some in the near term and still others over the longer-term.","In the near term, we could benefit from the proposed acquisition of a portion of the Rite Aid retail pharmacies for our partner Walgreens. This growth of a strategic anchor customer positions AmerisourceBergen for continued expansion of our business in our U.S. pharmaceutical footprint.","As you know, Express Scripts joined the WBAD's sourcing consortium earlier this spring. As a member of the WBAD joint venture and collaborative partner to both Walgreens and Express Scripts, we believe the greater size, scale and sourcing efficiency that should result from Express joining the JV will ultimately benefit us over the longer-term.","Additionally, we continue to explore new commercial opportunities and ways to work closely and collaboratively with Walgreens, as we do with all of our large anchor customers. Our goal is to optimize our strong strategic partnerships to drive further growth.","As outlined today, these market dynamics and the challenging healthcare space are hallmarks of our current environment, but we believe they are also opportunities for AmerisourceBergen and that we've shaped and evolved our business to best seize them as we move forward.","I do want to take a moment to thank the now more than 20,000 AmerisourceBergen associates who made all of this possible. Every day, I see performance that reminds me that we have the strongest team, the broadest experience base, and the deepest expertise in the industry. With our reorganization, we are even better equipped to capitalize on new market opportunities and work seamlessly across our broad customer base. It is our amazing team who grows, evolves and works together to enable AmerisourceBergen to be the company that it is, and that it will become. All of us are living our corporate focus every day, thank you.","So what does all of this mean as we move forward into fiscal year 2018? We believe it means that AmerisourceBergen can continue to advance our strategy, invest in our business, seize opportunities and, importantly, execute and successfully navigate the challenging healthcare space.","In summary, AmerisourceBergen is strong. We are evolving and we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. At AmerisourceBergen, we think, plan and act strategically to accomplish our goals, drive patient access, and build long-term sustainable shareholder value.","Now let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth look at our quarterly financial results, our updated financial guidance, and some color on fiscal 2018. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We are now in the home stretch of our fiscal year 2017, and considering the healthcare environment that we operate in, we are pleased with our results after nine months. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our third quarter financial results, an update on our full year 2017 outlook, and then make some high-level comments around our thoughts for fiscal 2018.","We finished slightly better than expected in the third quarter, with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.43, an increase of 4%. Despite some challenges in operating income in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, we are able to overcome these headwinds and still grow our adjusted EPS. I will review the segments a little later.","Let's begin with our consolidated results. ABC revenues were $38.7 billion, up 5%, helped by solid unit volume growth across several of our businesses.","As discussed in prior quarters, we again experienced a decline in year-over-year hepatitis C revenues of about 20%, causing a drag on our quarterly growth rate of about 120 basis points. The quarter's adjusted gross profit was down by about 1% to just under $1.1 billion. Our Other segment, which consists of global commercialization services and animal health, continued with its excellent growth. But this segment currently offsets the gross profit decline in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","Operating expenses, we continue to be laser-focused on spending in the right areas and leveraging our infrastructure. Overall, our OpEx was up about 2%. On a year-to-date basis, our positive expense trends have in part been related to effectively managing the opening days of several new distribution centers.","As Steve mentioned, it was impractical to delay the openings any longer and we've now opened four state-of-the-art DC this year. The uptick in our third quarter operating expenses, including depreciation, is primarily the result of these openings. We will open one more DC in Q4 and the last two new DCs will open in early fiscal 2018.","Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $471 million, down about 5%, with operating margins down 12 basis points due to the decrease in gross profit in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment.","Moving below the operating income line, income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 27%, down significantly from the prior year due to two primary drivers. The first tax item, as discussed on prior calls, we again recognize the benefit to income taxes related to the accounting rule change and share-based compensation. This benefit impacted our quarterly tax rate by roughly 2%.","In the second and third quarters, our share price has been higher, which has resulted in a large number of employee exercises. Given the nature of the tax benefit, it is very difficult to forecast the timing of exercises and the ultimate impact to our tax rate and financials.","The second tax item, in conjunction with our filing of our fiscal 2016 federal tax return, we finished our combined R&D credit and Section 199 tax projects with excellent first time results. We mentioned this work on our call last quarter. The tax projects contributed a tax benefit to the current quarter. However, about $10 million of the tax benefit was related to prior fiscal years, and is a discrete one-time item.","Consequently, we had a non-recurring 2% tax rate benefit in the quarter or a positive $0.05 benefit to our adjusted EPS. Our adjusted net income was up roughly 2% to $318 million. We continue to find ways to grow despite headwinds and an evolving healthcare market. Our adjusted diluted share count decreased nearly 7 million shares or 3% year-over-year to 222 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the June quarter as we repaid our $600 million of senior notes upon maturity in May. We have about $890 million remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase program.","Wrapping up our consolidated results. In the June quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $354 million which was lower than anticipated due to its lower wind-down of extra inventory related to holiday timing and, to a lesser degree, the working capital impact from the new Prime JV business, which had a heavy brand drug inventory and sales mix. Our year-to-date fiscal 2017 free cash flow was a negative $248 million.","Let me highlight, we continue to expect meaningful positive free cash flow in our Q4, similar to the cash flow performance we've had in Q4 of our last two fiscal years. We ended the quarter with roughly $1.3 billion in total cash, a little lower than normal due primarily to repaying the May senior notes and the inventory timing I just mentioned. Our total cash amount we held \u2013 of the total cash amount we held about $800 million offshore. This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results.","Now let's turn to segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. So segment revenues were $37 billion, up a solid 5%. Our independent customer segment had very good organic growth at nearly 7%. We continue to see the benefits of working with our customer buying groups to improve overall compliance rates, which has translated into reduced leakage. We have been able to demonstrate value to our pharmacy customers when they source a higher percentage of their generics from us. Because of these efforts, the business had another solid quarter of generic volume growth.","Our ABSG specialty business, which primarily focuses on physician-administered drugs, had another strong revenue quarter, with growth of just over 10%, driven mostly by increased volumes. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of 10% or better revenue growth. We continue to see excellent revenue growth primarily in oncology, but also in several other therapeutic classes.","Let me highlight one more time that the Distribution segment had a revenue headwind of about 120 basis points due to lower hepatitis C sales in the quarter. The good news, our hepatitis C revenues on a sequential basis, so between our March and June quarters, were flat. This is the first time in the last eight quarters that sequential hep. C. revenues did not decline. Segment operating income was $377 million, down about 9%. This segment benefited from the continued growth in our businesses that primarily service physician practices with specialty drugs, with income up just over 10%.","The segment also benefited from overall brand and generic volume growth. However, the overall decline in the segment's operating income was caused by three meaningful headwinds. First, on the drug pricing side, the 2016 June quarter was the last quarter we had instances of impactful generic drug price increases. We had a nominal contribution in the current June 2017 quarter.","To a lesser degree, we also had a headwind from lower brand inflation in the current quarter. Second, we renewed a key contract with Kaiser last year. This repricing was a gross profit headwind in the June 2017 quarter. As we enter the September quarter, this contract renewal headwind is now anniversaried. And the third item, we continued to experience lower throughput or shipments in our PharMEDium business. The business team is working diligently to complete the QC process. In addition to enhancing compliance, this will also lead to a superior quality offering and provide a further competitive advantage in the market.","So, in summary, the segment continued to make progress in several key areas. But positive contributions weren't enough to offset the headwinds this quarter. We can now move to the other segment.","This segment includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI, businesses that focus on global commercialization services and animal health. In the June quarter, revenues reached a record $1.7 billion, up 11%.","Our MWI and consulting businesses had revenue growth just over 10%. Our World Courier business had a record number of shipments in the quarter. And on a comparable basis, revenue growth in U.S. dollars was 7% or 10% in local currency.","To provide a little more color on MWI we had a strong revenue quarter with comparable U.S. companion animal revenue growth of 11%, primarily from sales of new innovative drugs, organic growth with existing customers, and the addition of new customers.","From an operating income standpoint, this segment had an excellent quarter with operating income of $95 million and a growth rate of 15%. We are especially pleased with the results this quarter of World Courier and Lash and Xcenda consulting businesses.","This completes our segment review. Let's move to our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. With one quarter to go we are updating our guidance. Revenues, we are revising the full year growth rate to a range of approximately 5%.","At this point in the year, we have a better understanding of market and customer dynamics, related manufactured drug pricing trends and scrip growth rates. Let me highlight it's a bit of an unusual year that we will have two less business days in fiscal 2017 versus the prior year.","Moving to operating expenses, we continue to expect an overall increase of 2% to 3% in full year OpEx. Next, operating income. We now expect operating income dollar growth to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower revenue growth, a slightly lower contribution in Q4 from brand drug price increases, and a slightly lower contribution from PharMEDium.","Income taxes. Based on favorable year-to-date tax benefits and initiatives, we now expect that our full year tax rate will be approximately 31%. Adjusted EPS. We are now revising our full year guidance to a new range of $5.82 to $5.92, which reflects growth of 4% to 5% versus fiscal 2016. And we currently expect to end the year in the mid to upper half of that range. Free cash flow. We now expect to finish the year between $750 million and $1 billion in free cash flow. The $260 million litigation reserve that we highlighted in our press release and 8-K this morning is likely to be paid by September 30. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, we expect our cash flow to be negatively impacted by the investments related to onboarding the Prime JV business and lower overall revenues. That concludes our discussion on our full-year fiscal 2017 financial guidance.","Looking ahead, while we have a strong handle on our business, our corporate process moving forward will be to provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance needs to be informed by and reflective of the formal output of our completed business planning process. As Steve discussed, we are also working through our new ABC organizational structure. Consequently, we are still in the early stages of our fiscal 2018 business plan process. However, we are in a position to share some select commentary on headwinds and tailwinds.","Starting with the headwinds. First, pricing. For brand inflation, based on the actual pricing activity to date, it's likely that the inflation rate we modeled for fiscal 2018 will be at the low end or slightly below our fiscal year 2017 range. For generic deflation, it's important to remember that deflation is a headwind that we have to work to offset, primarily achieved by increasing volumes. We have yet to see generic deflation ease from its current high single digits, where it's been for about three quarters now. We are still evaluating the probability of this continuing into fiscal 2018 as part of our planning process.","Next, operating expenses. As mentioned previously, we decelerated the opening of our new DCs, minimizing the fiscal 2017 OpEx impact. This strategic phasing means that the fiscal 2018 related DC OpEx will be considerably higher. It's likely there will be a mismatch of new DC OpEx with any associated incremental revenues. Also, in relation to our reorganization, we are currently evaluating possible investments in IT systems. These investments may yield organizational benefits and efficiencies over time but would be a short-term headwind.","Overall, we will be diligent in our strong management of OpEx, but we do anticipate a higher OpEx growth rate in fiscal 2018. The last headwind to call out at this point is taxes. We will see an increase in our overall tax rate as we expect the favorable benefit from employee option exercises to slow. Additionally, we have to lap certain one-time discrete tax benefits recognized to-date in fiscal 2017. And finally, as a reminder, the addition of any significant new U.S. business, like Walgreens' pending acquisition of the Rite Aid pharmacies, would change the mix of our pre-tax income and increase our overall tax rate.","Let's close the fiscal 2018 discussion with tailwinds. First, revenues. Our customer base, which includes our strategic partner relationships, has us well-positioned to continue to grow in today's healthcare environment. This, combined with our leadership in specialty, differentiates us and will enable strong top line revenue growth. The next tailwind, compliance rates for our independent customers. We have made steady progress during the last 12 months reducing leakage and improving our market share. We expect to make further progress in fiscal 2018, but likely at a slower pace. Let me point out once compliance rates reach higher levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to capture incremental volumes especially since we aren't willing to sacrifice fair compensation. And the last tailwind, PharMEDium. As I mentioned, we anticipate that we will complete the quality initiatives this fiscal year. Customers are already seeing the value in our superior quality standards. We expect sales volumes and growth rates to ramp during fiscal 2018.","Wrapping up my comments this morning, at this point, we expect the healthcare environment will be similar in fiscal 2018 to this year. We have shown our ability to execute within the current market. Therefore, we are uniquely positioned and we remain confident in our ability to grow our business in the coming year. As always, we continue to focus on achieving our core objectives: delivering outstanding service, solutions and value to our customers and also delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","Thank you, and here's Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Tim. Let's move to Q&A. As a reminder, we're going to keep it to one question per caller this morning. Operator, can we go to the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the questions. Yeah. So it looks like you guys are continuing to operate under the assumption that generic deflation will stay in the negative 7%, negative 9% range this year and into next year. But there seems to be some disconnect with what you and your peers are seeing compared to what the manufacturers are communicating currently. And even this morning, the largest generic manufacturer in the world was talking about a worsening environment with accelerated price erosion and increase in generic approvals. So kind of a long question, but I was hoping maybe you could help us square the differences in what you and your peers are seeing versus maybe what your suppliers are currently communicating?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, we \u2013 I haven't looked at the results in detail, Bob, but thanks for the question, but I don't think it was materially different. And our competitor that released earnings this week talked about a mixture of sell and buy side, and we really just talk about buy side. But it's \u2013 we're hoping that Dr. Gottlieb will start having an impact that will focus on \u2013 where there's only two or three manufacturers that products have been approved, not where there's eight to 12. And that also we'd see some momentum in areas like biosimilars and new product approvals from the FDA. So that's how we look at it, but we still are seeing 7% to 9% range. So \u2013 but definitely towards the high end of that range. Tim, anything to add?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I would just add, Bob, quickly, I think it's important to remember, our deflation basket is unique to ABC. We may look at it differently than others. How we exclude launches, launches that lose exclusivity, and after a certain period, we exclude those. So again, everybody looks at us slightly differently. We have more than 15,000 SKUs broad-based. But as Steve mentioned, we're on the high end. And I think, it's important that for us, as we talk about fiscal 2018, it's still an open item. It's clearly one of the macro items that we're evaluating and is critical in terms of our plan assumption in 2018. So we are watching it and monitoring it.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup","Good morning, Steve and Tim. Maybe taking the comments on fiscal 2018 and approaching it a little bit differently. So I realize that last year could have been an exception. But last year, at this point, you had offered 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth for the following fiscal year with various headwinds at that time. And I \u2013 we appreciate the headwinds and tailwinds now, but some of those headwinds from last year seems to have abated. So this year, the Street is expecting about 8% earnings growth for next year ahead of your release this morning. So is that something that you're comfortable with or any sort of \u2013 just any additional color that you could share?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes, I'll \u2013 good morning, Garen, I'll start and Steve can jump in. I mean, we think it's really important to have our planning process complete and make sure that we're transparent and it's very comprehensive. We're just not in a position yet to do that. We have to finish our planning process. There are just a lot of moving parts. So at this point, we felt it was appropriate to call out headwinds, items that we think \u2013 headwinds and tailwinds, items that we think that we're monitoring, that are impactful. We're contemplating that we need to work through. That's really the best we can do at this point. But I would say also we're also working through the new organizational structure.","So I think in a lot of ways, there are just several moving parts right now. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on our top line revenue. I mean, I \u2013 just one more thing I'll say quickly is that revenue drives the P&L, it drives the cash flow. We need to spend more time looking at our top customers' revenue forecast. It could be organic or inorganic product mix. Pricing, that's critically important. So we still have a fair bit of work to do. And when we're prepared, which is at the end of the year, we'll provide full complete guidance.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Garen.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great. Thanks very much. And I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around revenue as we think about the shift and your expectations on revenue, was it that you initially had maybe some other customers coming on board? Are you seeing a change in utilization, a change in pull-through from your independent customers? How do we think about that? And then you're translating that into your comments around 2018 that you expect 2018 revenue growth to be strong. Is that the anticipation that Walgreens will be able to close this transaction with Rite Aid? Is this one of those two things as we think about revenue?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I'll start. No. We haven't really \u2013 it's one of the reasons why we're delaying any guidance into 2018 because we'd like to get a couple more weeks into seeing how the approval process goes on Rite Aid. So we think that that's a key trend, but we do see a continued trend of mix shift in our benefit, which is the specialty business. We are definitely one of the things we're most proud of this year is our strong growth in independents, and I was at our ThoughtSpot tradeshow two weeks ago, and I'd just say that I am full of admiration for that customer segment. It's really remarkable how they manage with limited networks, with really declining reimbursements with the DRIPS that some even continue to have just very strong businesses.","And also that the business that we're doing very well there, the new service that we're offering and we're doing very well there is the transition services business, so really pharmacies that want to retire, offering those businesses to other independent pharmacies, which is a great strength \u2013 sign of the strength of our business. The other key trends going on. The hepatitis C has been a very big change in our business. Walgreens generic utilization sometimes has been much more accelerated than we thought. And overall, I just would tell you that even doing very well with unit sales in generics this year, the deflation is a big headwind, and unfortunately, it repeats itself again next year.","So those are some of the revenue trends. Utilization, these are \u2013 it's a good question. We don't really see anything. I've heard a lot of questions about hospital inpatients utilization. We are a little bit behind there, but we really do track more on aggregated IMS number, but we continue to evolve our forecasting. And it's not out of the question that we'll look more at utilization trends on scrips with some of the deflation and inflationary trends we've seen. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Just quickly so we can move along, I think, Lisa, for 2017, one of the bigger impacts on revenues will just be in brand inflation. We do a large percentage in brand business and having that inflation move to the lower end of the range at just the sheer amount of dollars that we do is a big headwind, and that was a little bit of a moving target this year on where brand inflation would end.","As we look forward to 2018, I mean I think our largest customer, strategic partner, Walgreens, I mean they're ramping up certain aspects \u2013 certain commercial business activities. And just like Prime, we'll have that commercial business for a whole year next year in 2018, so we'll have that benefit. But as we contemplate fiscal year 2018 and good solid revenue growth, we're not factoring in acquisitions or inorganic growth. It's just the full year impact of the organic growth.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks and good morning, Steve and Tim. So just quickly as it relates to Rite Aid. You guys did mention previously that the Rite Aid volume could onboard at ABC roughly six months after a potential acquisition of Rite by Walgreens, I guess under the new revised smaller Rite asset purchase. Is that six-month timing still a good assumption for when ABC could take over as distributor for Rite, if that smaller asset purchase is consummated by Walgreens?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I think, Steve, we \u2013 it's probably based \u2013 we will really try to give you guidance in three months' time. We don't think it's for us to comment on what the purported integration plans are. And, you know, it's complex but we just don't think it's our position to comment, but we did say six months and that does seem like a reasonable period after a close, in general, I would say.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's fair. And just very quickly, on the bright side in the Other segment, you guys have done a good job posting operating profit well in the double-digits last three quarters above the full year guides of high single-digit growth. Is there any more color on really what's driving that upside in particular? And then how much of that could carry over into FY 2018 as well?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, we're all very proud, and I think one of the things that we accomplished in this organization is putting these higher demand-generating businesses together under Jim Cleary's leadership, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results that Jim will drive, he's dug right in; he's, since he relocated to Philadelphia, spending a lot of time in Charlotte where we have a lot of big technology investments. Our animal health business is very strong. We are seeing pickup in some of the production animal trends.","We had a very strong 2016 as well, so they're lapping very strong performance. World Courier, we're doing well. We've also got some very big systems investment there, and they \u2013 we should see a similar sort of year next year. They have \u2013 their market is not growing in double-digits, but they are our strong performer and they participate well in the competitive positioning. And Lash has just been a very strong performer for several years now. We have a huge technology investments there. Overall, as these things go, it's going pretty well. On the big project Fusion, we're on track and on budget and we should have some customers going live in the next couple of months, which we're confident should go well. But those are the sort of the key drivers. Healthcare reform is we're going to think not going to be any negative. It could be a positive impact to Lash in the long term. So \u2013 and in the animal health market, the demographics there are may be even better than humans because pets are living so much longer and there are just more and more of them, and I think people are more in love with them, many of us, so it's the companion side, and we're confident there. And I think again, if there's any area where we have more interesting M&A opportunity, it's really in those services businesses because they're not affected by a single payer type market, et cetera. So we are very interested in M&A in that section as well, so. Thank you.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Operator, can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","Yes. And that will come from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","So just thinking about next year, and again, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, maybe in terms of thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds, can you give us a sense of how that should shake out relative to some of the cash flow dynamics of the business? Particularly, I know you talked about your level of disappointment, the cash flow generated so far year-to-date. And so as we jump into next year, as we think about some of those headwinds, tailwinds, anything specifically we can call out that could be impacting next year's performance?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I would say certainly, we're behind a little bit in terms of where we are for the year, where we thought we'd be for our third quarter, but most of that is timing and will reverse in Q4. We still expect pretty solid free cash flow for fiscal year 2017. I think it's important to really stress that. Just from a foundational standpoint, nothing's changed. We are a little bit lower in free cash flow this year in 2017 than we expected originally, but the core cash flow metrics are still all in place. So, I mean in terms of next year, I wouldn't say to call anything out. We expect we're still committed to our target.","I think that's really important. We're still committed to our target of free cash flow add to about approximately 125% of adjusted net income, given the mix and how we expect to grow generics. So, I mean, I think, that's a real positive point to make to everybody.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we go to the next call, please?","Operator","Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. Steve, you commented that OpEx spending will be considerably higher next year. It looks like it's going to be up around 2% this year. Just want to trying to quantify what considerably means or if we can quantify what a DC might cost or what the variable cost would be if you decided to make that investment in the IT systems? Any color around that would be really helpful.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I'll just make one quick comment, and then let Tim get into specific guidance. We didn't mention in the script, but I was at the Indianapolis opening two weeks ago exactly, and boy, I wish you guys could see these new 350,000 or so square foot distribution centers. We have the technology, the organization there that really allows us to scale. I mean, just for example, this facility is not even a month old and they did 56,000 lines and not before we got there and just running so well.","So we've got these down and we're proud of the investment and we believe it's a great \u2013 AmerisourceBergen is the most reliant on automation in our distribution systems, and we are sincerely proud of those investments we make. We have two more that we'll do next year as we talked about, but we had a year of very low OpEx growth despite some big capital expenditures. We monitor those expenditures and make sure that we get the yields out of them that we expect. But we have over 20,000 associates that we're proud of that deserve to be fairly compensated. So you start off with benefit and about a 4% wage assumption. So that drives a lot of it and then we're opening two new centers and that's really \u2013 I think, Tim is going to give you more specific points, but that's really what's driving it for next year, nothing more specific than that.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes. No. Thanks, Kevin. Again, my comments that from earlier were definitely that we would see OpEx growth, I mean, we're going to be very mindful and do what we can, but we're going to have the full year impact of the DCs open. Some will still have the new DC and the old DC. We mentioned ABC Order, Steve mentioned Fusion, I mean, these are fairly large systems that, again, as you think about it, we bring on a new system and we still have the expense of the old system.","So in many ways next year, we have some duplication and we don't have the full year benefit of gross profit or savings or revenues. So, there is \u2013 I call that a little bit of a mismatch. I don't think we're ready to tell you specifically, but we just know that we've done a terrific job this year and we're going to be up 2% to 3%, which is just outstanding for the company. We're just telling our investors in the sell side, as you think about 2018 in your model, just make sure you contemplate that it's going up because of these items.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. On the lower cash flow guide and the higher receivables trend, was that all attributable to the Prime relationship? And can you remind us kind of how those relationships are influencing dynamics from a working capital perspective? Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, let me just jump in here. The change in our cash flow guidance, free cash flow guidance for 2017 is strictly due to, one, the litigation reserve which we highlighted this morning, $260 million that we fully expect to pay and fund by the end of the year. And then almost equally is really the investment in the Prime business, which is heavy brand, and the cash conversion cycle just isn't as optimized as generics. So that's really the change of why we had to drop the free cash flow guidance for full year fiscal 2017.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Erin.","Operator","Thanks. We'll go to the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Just a question on Express Scripts joining WBAD, I mean, how should we be thinking about your views on how that accrues to you guys next year in terms of improved buying power? And then do you think that'll be enough or close enough to offset some of the things that you were talking about in terms of the pressures that you'll get on generic pricing?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I think, the interesting thing is that WBAD continues to grow in terms of the members we're attracting. If you look even at yesterday's announcement about PharMerica, that's another really (55:55) segment that presumably \u2013 and I'm not predicting, but presumably, if it closes, will come into WBAD as well. And Express Scripts is certainly a different type of dispenser and a retailer or a wholesaler than like AmerisourceBergen. So it just continues to grow the robustness of our collective portfolios and the strength of the individual partnerships within WBAD. So it's a good time for the partnership. I think we're also looking at other areas where WBAD could invest. I think I've made the comment in the past that if anything aggravates Mr. Pessina, it's the notion that WBAD is a static model, so we continue to look for new ways to invest.","So we are thrilled that WBAD was the first purchasing consortium that's achieved a lot of our objectives, and we're ready for the next generation of memberships, which is really starting next year, potentially with two new members and then also a potentially new product category. So we're thrilled about WBAD. Specific financial benefits from it that affect 2018, certainly one of the things we're looking at, but probably really won't know until we enter the contracting period in actual calendar 2018.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, Steve, you talked about the next generation of memberships associated with WBAD. So can you just help us better understand how that benefits you? If there are new members that are added, does that mean that you can garner additional savings?","And then if we could get also just a little bit of more detail on the operating expenses. I mean, obviously, you're going to have some duplicate facilities next year. It sounds like you had some duplicate facilities this year as well. You opened four of them throughout the year, planning to open four. So how should we think about the on-boarding and off-boarding? So should we see duplicate costs for a quarter or for more? It's just going to really help us as we think about the modeling.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, go ahead, Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Steve, I'll jump in and take the last one just about OpEx. Again, Ricky, I just can't be real specific at this point. We're still working through all that. But, I mean, year-to date, we were \u2013 through March, through six months, we were relatively flat on OpEx. This quarter, we were up 2%. In Q4, it's certainly going to be higher in order to glide into the 2% to 3% that we said for the year.","So I mean \u2013 and again, a lot of the duplication from 2017 is coming in the second half or even late in the year. So, I just \u2013 the point is, you need to \u2013 as we communicate out externally and you model, you just \u2013 you need to just be thoughtful like we're being, in terms of next year it's going to be a little bit higher, certainly, as you think about our OpEx trend.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, and then on the WBAD, I don't think there's too much more to say. I think, we've said what we can say. Obviously, more members coming into our particular consortium, anything that makes our relationship with Express Scripts more sticky, more integrated, and we've talked about this, is a big positive. So I think obviously, a strong partner like Express Scripts had a choice of buying consortiums, so again, it's a strong validation of the strength of WBAD that Express Scripts chose to join us.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks so much, Ricky. Operator, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning. So, thanks for all the commentary on next year, but I'm trying to understand \u2013 you also sort of talked about some potential changes at FDA, obviously the inflation environment's been a bit uncertain, at least on the generics side. How are you thinking about sort of ABC returning to sort of more of the traditional growth rates you've sort of aspired to be, in particularly on the earnings line?","And how much \u2013 whether you can get there with sort of the existing organic business versus how much you need to bring in inorganically? Because the balance sheet's getting to a pretty good state where you could sort of do M&A again. How are you sort of thinking about that external versus internal mix? And obviously, again, I'm not asking for 2018 guidance, but more the path there forward back to a more steady-state rate maybe in the double digits?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, that's definitely an aspirational goal for us, and we like growing in the double digits more. Certainly, the general market was over 10%, 12%, 13%, 14%, so that's a help, because we expect to grow with the market. And then we're probably a percent or two higher because of the customer partnerships we have and the specialty exposure we have. Again, because of that mix, it's a little bit harder for us and the larger customers tending to grow faster than \u2013 the smaller customers, although, I will note, we had a very strong year with independents this year, and a strong year in our specialty business as well.","So market conditions, the political uncertainty, is something top of our mind at the moment. It could be the action on pricing. There are a lot of unknowns. And then you'll see us emphasize that the service, the commercialization, the demand creation businesses, Animal Health business, these are areas where we hope to grow. And on capital deployment, first of all, we've kind of liked buying larger companies. Tim always says, it's as much work to buy a small company as a large company.","And yeah, so all things being equal, we're comfortable in that $500 million to $3 billion range is a good range for us, and we \u2013 but we're very picky. We've chosen the market leaders, we like that. We've retained most of the management team at PharMEDium, particularly the people that we are very keen to retain that were more core business people as opposed to brought in by (1:02:43). And then in MWI, we've retained with two or three financial people, we retained and promoted and grown the talent there very remarkably, I think. So, we think we do M&A very well and we're just very selective, and I think that's what the investors currently expect from us.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I'll jump in and say, Ross, I mean, Steve mentioned it, that capital deployment is critically important to us. It's certainly part of the equation to get back to that aspirational mid-teens. We \u2013 our balance sheet, we're in terrific position with our balance sheet. We've worked hard to do that, and we talked about earlier on the call, we expect to get back to a very solid free cash flow in 2018 and beyond. So we're going to be positioned very well to deploy capital to grow our business long term.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Thanks.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator I think we have time for a couple more questions. Can we go to the next one please?","Operator","Yes, and that will be from Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on the \u2013 just quickly on the headwinds for next year. If you were to sort of rank them, which ones would you say are probably more impactful as you think about your planning? And then just one question on deflation side. You've talked about you're still seeing it trending pretty negatively at least in the same range as last year. But when you look at, there's a couple of big generics that had one multisource last year, we're going to start lapping that. Do you not expect to see any kind of at least easier comparisons as you go into the back half of the year? Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I don't \u2013 Charles, thanks. I mean we listed out the headwinds. We didn't necessarily put them in any type of rank order. There are items that we're looking at and evaluating, so I'd prefer probably not to evaluate them. But again, we're being transparent, we let you know what we're thinking about. In terms of generic deflation, certainly, there's a top 10 list that has higher deflation. The deflation that we see in our basket is maybe a little bit more broad-based. So, again, I think, we \u2013 in our comments I think we expected not to ease, at least where we're at right now, we don't think anything will change. We're still saying it's going to be in that 7% to 9% and not easing and not getting worse. So that's positive, it's stable, but still in that 7% to 9%.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks Charles.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, can you talk a little bit about sort of the sell side dynamics that you're seeing? So I understand there's still significant deflation on the buy side, but what about the pricing you're charging to your customers? And any sort of like market activity that you can describe? Would you say there's a period I think last year where some folks are getting very aggressive about trying to take some independent share? Can you talk a bit about sort of the sell side dynamics, has that stabilized or not? And why can't you drive a higher margin if the pricing you're buying these generics for is actually declining? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I mean, we \u2013 I think on just the very last part of that, I think we're always mindful on what the reimbursement is for our customers and making sure that they can remain in networks and dispense profitably. So that's definitely one of the metrics we look at. We're very encouraged by the way we work with our buying groups and we've put out our compliance rates up to a level where we think that where we're getting our fair share of wallet. That's \u2013 if any of our sales people are listening, that's not an invitation for you to relax. That's an invitation for you to keep up the hard work and try to get even another 1% or 2%, but there is a certain natural feeling on which we can do that.","We haven't had a big contract for a while. So we're doing the more enjoyable work of working hard with partnering and collaborating and looking at new opportunities with our customers. Having said that, there's markets where, of course, we always have competition. We don't talk about the customers that are under $1 billion and there's community oncology customers, there's competition, there's independent pharmacies, that are deciding which buying group they're going to belong to. So, there's always something going on.","We could have been a little bit ahead of the contract renewal cycle within our industry. So we might have been on the front end of renewing some contracts with Kaiser and CPA or particularly two that come to mind that the new investment we make with WBA. So we've got through a lot of that and we don't have a lot of big contracts. And also, to the best of my knowledge, we did not do any significant contract that's out of market. So we feel on the sell side in really good shape. So next question, please?","Operator","And the last question will come from the line of Evan Stover with Robert W. Baird.","Evan A. Stover - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thank you. I wanted to kind of ask the flip side of Charles question, which is on the buy side trends. You guys have historically I think talked about less than 8% of your brand gross profit contingent on inflation. Your peers are talking about making a lot of progress to get down to your very low levels there. I'm just wondering if there's more work to do there if that number goes lower and what the impacts of that would be on both your near-term and your long-term trends from lessening the contingencies of brand price increases. Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, no, I think you said the brand inflation rates are about 7% to 9%, similar to the actual generic deflation rate. And it's been a little bit slower. It's more towards the 7%. The increases we saw last cycle were a little bit more subdued than we might have expected. But 90% of our contracts, and we've talked about this for a while, we don't earn any gross profit from inflation. So we feel we're very well protected that out of 10%, we've talked a lot about this that we're trying to eliminate that. I've been in some of those negotiations myself, and we continue to make progress, and I would see it go higher than 90% as we get through the next generation of people service contract. So thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session. I turn it back to Ms. Mattox.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, I am sorry, we just one more comment for Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Oh, no, I \u2013 Steve, I just thought it's important to \u2013 I think, Evan, maybe you're asking just about a headwind or impacts, and we wouldn't expect \u2013 as we convert those over, we wouldn't expect to have a headwind and convert those \u2013 convert the economic or the fee-for-service. We provide substantial value to manufacturers and we believe we should be fairly compensated for that. And that's what we're always working to do.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, so let me just wrap up, Keri, by saying that \u2013 I will take some of my favorite themes from our script. Our restructuring really has positioned us very well and focused us on what I believe are the most important things for our long-term future, which is a lot of these with customer accessibility and integration. Again, we're strategically focused on the U.S. pharmaceutical market in both animal and human health, and there's strong demand for the products and we've made all the right investments. I talked about the warehouses we've invested in. Tim talked a lot about the systems, the Fusions and the World Courier system that we're doing, the crude projects. So we are very, very excited about our business. We're excited about our performance this year and look forward to completing out the fiscal year and give you guidance for 2018 in about three months.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bennett Murphy. Please go ahead.","Bennett Murphy","Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2019 first quarter financial results. I am Bennett Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen, and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman President and CEO and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today\u2019s call, we will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations provided in today\u2019s press release are also available on our website.

Steve?","Steven Collis","Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's solid first quarter fiscal 2019 performance, however our role in the supply chain value creation in the ongoing responsibilities and finally, our company\u2019s strong position for long term growth and shareholder value creation. First, our quarterly financial performance.","Revenues were up an impressive 4% to $45.4 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.60 for the first quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the previous fiscal year period. As we left the last significant quarterly contribution from PharMEDium it is important to highlight the strong results from our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses. The continued execution by these businesses that are supporting growth of our customers and delivering strong performance in specialty distribution along with share buybacks and tax reform have helped offset the headroom caused by PharMEDium over these past four quarters.","We are extremely proud of the strong stock for fiscal 2019 and recognizing that this -- and recognize that this success would not have been possible without the hard work of our dedicated associates. I personally want to thank our 21,000 associates\u2019 everyday on driving this performance and maintaining a high impact culture that unlocks expertise and facilitates collaboration with our customers, partners and fellow colleagues.","As I mentioned, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment executed extremely well despite the ongoing challenges at PharMEDium. The segments double digit year-over-year revenue growth reflects several key successes. First, I\u2019ll read an end to this focus on execution in an evolving and dynamic marketplace, deepening relationships with our partners, providing the solutions they need and enabling patient access to pharmaceuticals wherever and whenever they need them.","Next, our market-leading Specialty Distribution franchise of oncology and physician administered products continues to perform exceptionally well. Our deep expertise in Specialty Distribution and comprehensive offering of services and solutions, both over the last several decades continues to empower community based providers to best service their patients by enhancing their ability to maximize fitness performance.","Finally, we have had great success, great volumes with existing customers. We believe that our portfolio of fast growing customers is a key differentiator and we are continuously seeking new ways to unlock value for our partners.","With regard to PharMEDium we are disappointed with where we are. But I\u2019m actively working to resolve the challenges. First, we have continued to communicate with regulators regarding potential resolutions. As those discussions continue, we are in the midst of conducting a comprehensive, strategic and financial review of the PharMEDium business.","Our approach is both, thoughtful and decisive. In fact, we have already engaged with a new CGMP consulting firm to support remediation efforts and enhancements across the entire PharMEDium business.","In addition, we have begun a workforce reorganization to appropriately position the business to execute once remediation is complete. Jim will provide more details in his comments. However, I want to reiterate that PharMEDium\u2019s focus remains on patient safety and delivering the safest and highest quality products. The strategic and financial review of the business will be all encompassing, and could result in further investments either business optimization activities or even a potential set of business.","AmerisourceBergen want to ensure that decisions made from this review consider about the needs of PharMEDium customers and what is best for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. It is important to take you take a step back and appreciate the overall strength of AmerisourceBergen core pharmaceutical distribution businesses, which has helped to offset the financial headwind from PharMEDium during the same period.","I\u2019m extremely proud of our core distribution team\u2019s outstanding performance. I want to personally recognize the operational excellence facing best-in-class expertise, tenacity and relentless focus on customer experience. AmerisourceBergen is executing, innovating and supporting customer growth, and we continue to find new ways to expand upon our robust and pharmaceutical centered value proposition to create additional value for our customers and partners.","Specific to manufacturers, our value proposition include services and support enhanced access for pharmaceutical commercialization and companion and production animal health products through our global commercialization services and Animal Health Group reported as Adam.","As a group, during the first quarter these businesses achieved high single digit year-over-year revenue growth led by the standout performance of World Courier. As a leading global specialty logistics, World Courier continues to achieve double-digit growth by delivering high tax logistics services and enhancing the customer experience with new offerings and technology improvements.","Beyond World Courier, two of our other specialty commercialization services businesses serving customers outside the U.S. for operations in both Brazil and Canada posted solid performances. The focus on these of these businesses on delivering differentiated services is showing promising results. This quarter in particular, AmerisourceBergen consulting services benefited from strong performances in our Canadian operations, while also making good progress at Lash Group. Journey back to Lash customer launches onto the game changing fusion platform continues to advance.","Lash has also successfully extended key customer relationships, providing a stable and growing base of customer partnerships that position the business well for the long term. Finally, MWI expanded its relationship with our key animal health anchored customer and into its corporate account customer base demonstrating another example of our ability to deepen relationships with strategic partners throughout AmerisourceBergen.","As an enabler of access and creative efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen plays an important role in the supply chain, unlocking value for our partners and customers and delivering on our purpose to create healthier futures. AmerisourceBergen delivers complex, logistics and financial services driving cost efficiency within the healthcare supply chain and expanding patient access to vital pharmaceuticals.","Our focus on innovation and efficiency, together with scale, security, and capital we provide enable us to facilitate a broad range of functions that are crucial to multiple players within the ever evolving U.S. healthcare supply chain.","Over the past few months, there have been discussions in the U.S. regarding limitations around the ability of patients to realize the benefits of net prices for pharmaceuticals and I\u2019ll negotiate on their behalf. AmerisourceBergen is at its core, a healthcare solutions provider. As we look into the future, we believe there could be an opportunity for AmerisourceBergen and the distribution industry as a whole to help facilitate a possible solution for patient access to pharmaceuticals at the negotiated net prices.","Let me explain. The U.S. pharmaceutical distribution industry possesses the fundamental tools and relationships to possibly facilitate patient access to discounted or net price pharmaceuticals at the pharmacy counter given our unique positioning in the supply chain as a physical link between manufacturers and pharmacies and ultimately patients.","In fact, AmerisourceBergen and our peers have a long history of managing net price adjudication and health systems and alternate care settings. Every day AmerisourceBergen provides the financial services to health systems and manufacturers that allows for patient, for provider access to pharmaceuticals at a negotiated net prices, based on their agreements with manufacturers and we execute hundreds of millions of these transactions annually.","Given the strength of our business strategy, and ability to be a driver of all solutions, AmerisourceBergen believes similar processes could be utilized for adjudicating negotiated discounts in other settings, most notably retail pharmacy.","Certainly, this added service for the healthcare system would require time and investment. However, we are confident in both our value proposition and the industry\u2019s ability to work together with policy makers and commercial partners to further enable access and create additional efficiencies within the supply chain.","This opportunity demonstrates one of the many ways AmerisourceBergen can employ our unique strength and ability to increase efficiency and create additional value for manufacturers\u2019, payers, the U.S. healthcare system and most importantly, patients.","At AmerisourceBergen, we believe our responsibility to create healthier futures extends to social issues, such as engaging, and mobilizing to help create the opioid epidemic, an epidemic, a crisis that is facing all of us in the healthcare industry and in our country.","AmerisourceBergen is driving the supply chain is one of a logistics provider and distributor. We are responsible for getting FDA approved drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers to DA and rated pharmacies at the same time based on prescriptions by licensed health care providers.","Notably as a logistics provider and distributor, we do not have access to patient information and we are not qualified to interfere with a very personal clinical decisions made between patients and their physicians.","We take our role in the supply chain very seriously. We have adhered to all monitoring and reporting requirements, and provided daily reports to the DA of all controlled substances shipped to our customers, including opioid based medications.","We proactively stop suspicious orders, using algorithms and data analytics tools to identify orders of interest and to stop shipment of suspicious orders. We partner with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy Network, Walgreens and others on safe drug disposal programs.","On the philanthropic side, AmerisourceBergen foundation was close to other foundations and organizations to educate patients and support programs to help combat the crisis. Finally, AmerisourceBergen remains engaged. Our board, our management team and all our 21,000 associates know that the opioid epidemic is a top priority that we must work collectively to address.","We will continue to work. We are continuing to work to combat the crisis, while defending ourselves against litigation and being responsible stewards of shareholders capital. In closing, AmerisourceBergen provides connectivity for stakeholders throughout the healthcare system and whether the themes are efficiency, effective use of data, transparency, new ways to support value based care, or the widening road especially medicines and precision medicine, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to continue playing an integral role in helping our partners in what is certain to be an exciting future.","We have a clearly defined strategic focus on the U.S. pharmaceutical market, where we continue to see growth, strong patient demographics, significant value capture from increased pharmaceutical utilization, and a focus on delivering the best patient care.","Healthcare is a critical, integral part of the economy and pharmaceuticals clearly represents the most efficient form of patient care. AmerisourceBergen is attractive partner that helps enable success about stakeholders, both large and small to deliver care in what is a complex, healthcare market. We are intensely focused on the problems or opportunities our customers have in their business, and respond by modifying and enhancing point based in our offerings to meet the different needs of manufacturers and providers.","We remain confident in our ability to execute, evolve and transform our business to meet the needs of our customers, drive value for our stakeholders, and ultimately serve patients. More than ever, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results and our financial guidance update for fiscal 2019. Jim?","James Cleary","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. My remarks today will focus only on our adjusted non-cash financial results, growth rate and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release.","As Steve mentioned, we had a solid quarter, with impressive performance in our core distribution businesses, helping to offset the continued headwind from our PharMEDium business.","As a reminder, the December quarter last fiscal year had a significant contribution from PharMEDium which we now lack. And the comparison beginning with the March 2019 quarter will get easier, as it relates to that business.","While there is some complexity in our quarter-over-quarter comparisons due to the consolidation of Brazil, both pro forma and specialty joint venture, which I will help normalize for throughout my remarks. The results this quarter came in largely as expected with adjusted EPS slightly better, due to some of the items that I\u2019ll discuss later.","I will provide commentary in two main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted, quarterly, consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our revised fiscal 2019 guidance, reflecting our updated expectations for PharMEDium.","Turning now to our first quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, an increase of 3% primarily due to lower income tax expense and a lower share count. Also, the current quarter benefited from a couple pennies of onetime corporate items that are expected to reverse in the March quarter, namely a reduction in deferred comp plan liability caused by the December downturn and the broad equity markets.","Our consolidated revenue was $45.4 billion up an impressive 12% primarily driven by strong revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment.","Gross profit increased 8% or $90 million to $1.2 billion excluding the impact of consolidating Brazil gross profit would have increased 3% or $35 million. Consolidated operating expenses increased 17% to $731 million. Excluding Brazil, operating expenses would have been up 9% and if we were to back down on H. D. Smith, the increase would have only been 5% which includes an increase in bad debt expense that contributed about 2% of the 5% increase.","As the year progresses, the year-over-year comparisons will normalize since we acquired H. D. Smith and began consolidating Brazil, both in January 2018. We are tracking right in line with our expectations for full year consolidated operating expense growth in the mid-single digits, albeit slightly at the high end of that range due to our inclusion of consolidating Brazil and guidance, consolidated operating income with $472 million down 3% with our operating margin down 17 basis points.","As we had previously communicated, the December quarter was expected to be a headwind for operating income, due to the significant contribution from PharMEDium in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. If you were to exclude the negative year-over-year impact from PharMEDium and the positive year-over-year impact from H. D. Smith and Brazil, AmerisourceBergen adjusted operating income would have been of mid-single digits in the December quarter.","In the next three quarters of fiscal 2019, the year-over-year comparisons should not be distorted as it was in the December quarter given the meaningfully lower contribution from PharMEDium in the last three quarters of fiscal 2018 and the lapping of both the H. D. Smith acquisition and the Brazil consolidation.","Net interest expense increased 18% to $42 million. Excluding Brazil, the net increase was 7% due primarily to debt issued last year to fund the H. D. Smith acquisition, which we will begin to lap in the March quarter.","Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 20% and reflects primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from tax reform and a discrete state income tax benefit. The prior year quarter tax rate of 24% did not fully reflect the benefit from tax reform.","Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 214 million shares. In the December quarter, we decided to opportunistically repurchase shares earlier in the fiscal year than originally anticipated, buying back $226 million of our shares in the quarter.","We exited the quarter with $900 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization that the board approved in November 2018. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter we had free cash flow of $400 million, which was primarily due to our net income as the change in our net working capital balances were relatively small.","If you were to adjust for the gain from anti-trust settlement, adjusted free cash flow with $313 million in the quarter. We\u2019re off to a good start and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to finish in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash of which $550 million was held offshore, and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. In the quarter, we repatriated $350 million of cash held offshore for general corporate purposes. This completes the review of our consolidated results.","Now I will cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $44 billion up 12%. As mentioned earlier, the segment continues to benefit from the growth of our customers, and especially our largest customer Walgreens and continued strength in Specialty Distribution particularly in Oncology.","Businesses throughout the segment continued to work diligently, thoughtfully and collaboratively to support our strategic partners. Segment operating income decreased about 4% to $373 million.","As previously disclosed, the December quarter was expected to be meaningfully impacted by the headwind from PharMEDium. Considering the significant contribution PharMEDium made in the previous fiscal year compared to a loss at PharMEDium this quarter.","As Steve mentioned, we\u2019re in the midst of conducting a strategic and financial review of the PharMEDium business. Customer demand for sterile-to-sterile compounded products remains strong. However, the path to achieving full regulatory compliance with the updated 503B standards has certainly taken longer than initially estimated, and we expect that our ongoing discussions with regulators will likely result in entry into a consent decree.","Recognizing the shifting regulatory landscape and the current economics of the business, the management team has been evaluating PharMEDium\u2019s current allocation of resources and making decisions to appropriately position PharMEDium to execute.","As Steve mentioned, the initial phase of the strategic and financial review led to the redeployment of capital from the workforce to remediation efforts. For fiscal 2019 guidance purposes, we have removed any contribution from the Memphis facility. This downside scenario is factored into the original guidance. Therefore the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range remains unchanged at $6.65. However, we are lower the top end of our adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.85 from $6.95 to reflect the updated view on the fiscal 2019 outlook of PharMEDium.","As we continue to move forward on this path towards resolution at PharMEDium, we remain committed as taking the right step that consider both the needs of PharMEDium customers and what is best for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders.","Taking a step back, our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses continue to perform quite well. We had strong revenue growth throughout the group and we continue to achieve double digit growth in specialty enabling access to life-changing specialty products, while our ION solutions group continues to provide key resources and expertise to community-based oncology practices.","As I said earlier for the consolidated results the same is true for the segment results. Operating income would have been up in the mid single-digits in the December quarter backing out both the negative impact from PharMEDium and the positive impact from H.D. Smith in Brazil.","I will now turn to the other segment businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI.","In the quarter total revenue was $1.7 billion, up 8% primarily due to the consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and growth at both World Courier and consulting Canadian operations.","MWI\u2019s revenue was flat this quarter, negatively impacted by the manufacturer switch to agency from buy sell which we not begin to lap as well as the late cattle movements and the exiting of a smaller business line.","From an operating income standpoint this group had operating income of $99 million down about 1%. World Courier continued its strong operating income throughout in the quarter. However, and as expected the group didn\u2019t have lower contributions from both MWI and Lash.","MWI experienced pressure relating to rebates, but some of the rebate dollars recognized earlier in its strong fourth quarter in fiscal 2018, which had normalized by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. MWI\u2019s operating income growth rate is expected to improve going forward with the continued strengthening of its customer relationships and commercial partnerships.","Finally, our consulting business was down year-over-year as Lash continues the implementation of Fusion. During the quarter we made progress both in launching manufactured clients on this new technology platform and in new business development.","The feedback on Fusion continues to be positive and we continue to believe it is a long-term value driver for the business. Overall, we continue expect high single-digit operating income growth from the Commercialization Services and Animal Health group in fiscal 2019.","This completes the review of our segment results. So I will now turn to our fiscal 2019 guidance. Regarding revenue, we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digit percent range.","Revenue growth will normalized throughout the year to the mid single-digit range as we anniversary incremental business added in fiscal 2018 through our relationship with our largest customer as well as the Brazil Consolidation and H.D. Smith acquisition.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect operating expenses to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. While operating expenses are likely to finish towards the higher end of that range due to the consolidation of Brazil. We remain diligent in managing our expenses and leveraging our infrastructure particularly as we realized additional operational synergies from H.D. Smith.","Now I will turn to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the low single-digit percent range to reflect the impact to revise expectations at PharMEDium which I will cover as I discuss the revised guidance from a segment standpoint.","We now expect the operating income in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the low single-digit percent range. As I said earlier, we are now removing any contribution from Memphis.","We are certainly disappointed by where we are with PharMEDium, but we are extremely proud of the execution from businesses throughout AmerisourceBergen, particularly in core Pharmaceutical Distribution which are helping to offset the anticipated loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019.","Excluding PharMEDium this segment is performing well. The strong core fundamentals as we continue to benefit from our execution, market-leading specialty distribution and solid growth in full-line distribution which is continuing to benefit from our successful contracted balancing over the last few years.","Turning now to Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health; we continue to expect operating income to grow in the high single-digit percent range driven by the continued strong performance of World Courier, ongoing initiatives and expected improvements at MWI and continue progress within consultant.","Moving below the operating income lines for the tax rate, we continue to expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% which more closely represents our normalized estimated tax rate.","Regarding share repurchases given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter we now expect to finish the year around $215 million weighted average shares outstanding.","Regarding adjusted EPS, as I said earlier, we are narrowing our range to $6.65 to $6.85 lowering the top end due to our evaluation of business expectations of PharMEDium which reflect the assumption that Memphis facility will not reopen in fiscal 2019.","Turning back to our guidance range overall, there are many variables that go into our guidance range including how well our business unit execute. How well we are able to manage operating expenses, the efficiency and timeliness in capturing the H.D. Smith synergies and of course trends in brand and generic pricing and mix.","An additional key driver where we finish in the range will be execution at PharMEDium. How successful we are at remediation, operational effectiveness, financial efficiency and other strategic initiatives that we have underway at the business.","Turning now to cash flow. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Lastly, we re not making any changes to our working assumptions around pharmaceutical pricing for the full fiscal year, broadly speaking both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectation for the year. Certainly we are early in our fiscal year and we anticipate there will be some more band activity later in the year.","Regarding our fiscal second quarter adjusted EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance I will note that our second quarter adjusted EPS is likely to be relatively flat compared to previous year period due to lower compensation in the quarter from brand manufacturers compared to last year, the headwinds from PharMEDium, albeit at much smaller than the one in the December quarter and due to some one-time items that I\u2019ve mentioned earlier.","In closing, AmerisourceBergen businesses continue to perform well. The contribution and execution in core drug distribution businesses is impressive and continues to help offset the financial impacted challenges at our PharMEDium business. Core distribution fundamentals remain strong. We have key anchor customers growing well across the enterprise.","We are the leader in the fast growing markets for specialty distribution and services, and we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. AmerisourceBergen value proposition to its partners is undeniable and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.","Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now here's Bennett to start our Q&A.","Bennett Murphy","Operator, we will now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Good morning and thanks for all the colors so far. Just I want to start earlier some -- ask my question on PharMEDium and thinking about what this means to the total core. Jim, you mentioned kind of mid single-digit. I guess you\u2019d call it organic EBIT growth in the quarter. As you think about rest of the year with H.D. Smith still having some synergies obviously lapping -- in that low single-digit growth for the year how do you think about what core should be? And then, relative to the 200 to 300 basis points that you have talked about PharMEDium creating as a headwind for Pharma EBIT growth for the year, by my math, I think you\u2019re already there for the year. So, how do you think about the headwind specifically at the low end of the range for PharMEDium going forward?","James Cleary","Sure. We had caught when we first provide guidance at the beginning of the year that operating income growth would be low to mid single-digits and now we\u2019re indicating low single-digits and really the difference is taking out the upside scenario at PharMEDium. And so we are seeing strong performance. As we talk about in the core businesses and kind of that in mid single-digit growth in the core businesses. So as you think about PharMEDium the rest of the year and the impact, there was significant headwind in the December quarter that we talk about today.","And then there would be much smaller headwind in the March quarter from PharMEDium, and then its basically flat Q3 and Q4 versus last year. And so the PharMEDium headwind on a total basis represents about 2% to 3% headwind in operating income for fiscal year 2019, which is really the difference between the mid single-digit operating income growth and now the low single-digit operating income growth.","Michael Cherny","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. Yes, Steve, I just want to go back your comments on helping patients gain access and managing. I think you were talking about net price adjudication. Just to get a little bit of a better understanding. How exactly would that work relative to the current system? What role is ABC going to play? And then, are you envisioning a world because of the change towards net pricing that some of the -- that traditional services that might've been performed by others in the supply chain would potentially now be performed by the wholesalers?","James Cleary","Hi, Bob. Thanks for the question. We manage so many contracts and we primarily manage them in the health systems and ultimate size [ph] of area, institutional settings. But the areas that we could really manage more representative net price through the contract system at pharmacy counter. And it\u2019s really simple as that. So, there\u2019s a lot of investments that would be required as we load individual managed care contracts. But we think that could be a simply remedy.","The infrastructure exist, that the resources, expertise exist to do that. And we have about all the setbacks that are counted. I mean, most recently the insulin patients and we think that would really help the image of the industry and the understanding and make it more comprehensive and explainable to various stakeholders. So, we kind of \u2013 we are healthcare logistics and solution provider and we think that this would entirely consistent with that role without taking away from the very important role that others do including negotiating what that net cost should be. That\u2019s my outlook.","Robert Jones","Got it. And I guess just one on the numbers, Steve, if I could go back to some of the comments around branded inflation obviously, we\u2019re living in a low were branded inflationary environment, yet it looks like the result ex-PharMEDium and a few other the moving pieces that you guys called out that -- the core performed well, grew, expected to grow low single-digit. Is this the type of performance we should expect in the current branded environment? Or do you think there still needs to be kind of a change in the economic structure that exist between the wholesaler and the branded manufacturer?","James Cleary","We\u2019re happy with the quarter. I think we drove some value from really strong revenue growth, growth primarily coming from wide segment including our core customers. We already have 5% of our contracts that are really subject to. We look to math, the amount that we earn from people service and than the amount that we earn from brand inflation. Yes, that number has been coming down for years. And as you know it's another headwind that we have to deal with, but it's now at 5%. So it's not within the range of other headwinds that we could potentially face.","And it is legitimate discussion to be had and we often benefit from consolidation -- you know often and from consolidation on the manufacturer side. Yes. This is not, it's usually not a negative event for us, because I think it\u2019s well understood that the value we represent is fair. So sometimes we having companies that are really strong, that are really good users of our commercialization services in acquiring others or we have a stronger fee-for-service agreement in place and we were able to retain the elements of that. And if we have a week of fee-for-service we will do that with acquirer.","We also have done a good job of making the new enterprise aware of why our agreements are market based and fixed [ph]. So our group that negotiated fee-for-service contracts is sort of one of the unsung heroes of AmerisourceBergen and the industry. They do a really good job. And I think we have constructive discussions around value and what do we representing the channel. The services that are asked in the first part of your -- of your question to me are very exciting because it could represent a whole new fee-for-service element for us as we do that very real work of loading managed care contracts at the pharmacy level. So I think that could be exciting new dimension for AmerisourceBergen.","Robert Jones","Got it. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning Steve and Jim. So I guess for me just back in the PharMEDium operations for a minute here. I'm sure you spent a lot of time probably exploring Plan B alternatives over the past six to 12 months. And I think for us as we think about various Plan Bs given what you know now about the Memphis situation, it's kind of thinking out loud does it makes sense to perhaps explore doing site transfers to other facilities? Does it make sense to look at a third-party contract manufacturers or CMO that you could work with to fill the gap? And also there maybe even other acquisitions you could make to just add manufacturing capacity for that business? So guys, I\u2019m just curious to hear more about this topic? How you're thinking about any sort of Plan B that could potentially help the overall business? Thanks.","James Cleary","Yes, sure. And as you can imagine it is being commented on and we commented on in our comment today, we're in the midst of strategic and financial review of the business. As we've indicated we've engaged with the new GMP consulting firm that we're working with. We did the workforce reorganization and putting more capital into the remediation. We'll be reviewing and this review is comprehensive and it could result in a number of things, could result in further investments in the business, could result in a business optimization through a number of things and could also result in a potential sale of the businesses, as Steve said. And so it's really too early to speculate on future decisions, but we obviously, our future decisions we\u2019ll consider the important needs of our customers and we'll also consider the needs of AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. And the timing in all that's probably open-ended, right, there's no date you've been imposing yourself to figure this out one way or the other, we should probably does assume maybe sometime by the end of calendar 019 we'll get some clarity on this one way or the other. Is that a good framework for now?","Steven Collis","Yes. We're putting out -- we're putting a lot of resources into this and doing an extensive review, but we're not putting a specific date on it.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up back on PharMEDium again. If we think about, Jim, that total contribution of our medium today, I know you talked about it in the growth rate, but if you were to think about exiting this business is there a way to quantify how much far medium contributes to the business today? And then secondly, you talked a lot about remediation. I'm sure there is cost associated with that. So as we think about netting those out and have you thought about what potentially PharMEDium could bring as far as what you could tell it for? Just trying to think that, because your core business looks so good, right now, just try to think about if we backed all of that out what the potential for AmeriSource would be?","James Cleary","Yes. I think that you're absolutely right. I mean the core business is performing very well and I think the best way to look at PharMEDium from a financial standpoint is the point that we're making that -- but it's really the different for AmerisourceBergen between mid single-digit operating income growth and low single-digit operating income growth. As we said, it was a significant headwind in the December quarter will be a much smaller headwind in Q2 and flat versus last year in Q3 and Q4. And you know in total it has approximately 2% to 3% impact on operating income over the course of the whole year. And so I think that's the best way to think about the financial impact of PharMEDium. And as I said earlier we're just really doing this extensive financial review and strategic review and investing in the remediation and that process is ongoing.","Lisa Gill","But just so I understand that correctly, everything they talked about has to do with the Memphis facility and the headwind of that. The other roughly 60% of the business is still performing. So, if you were to exit the business altogether there would be potentially an incremental headwind from the operating profit that you have from the rest of PharMEDium. Am I thinking about that correctly?","James Cleary","Yes. So Memphis is closed, as you know. So the other three facilities do not cover PharMEDium\u2019s fixed cost. And as the other three facilities production levels are limited a bit as we're really implementing additional procedures and additional testing. But I think the key thing is to answer your question that the other three facilities don't cover PharMEDium\u2019s fixed costs, and so, even with the other three facilities, let\u2019s say, it is a headwind.","Lisa Gill","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Thanks. I just wanted to ask one more about PharMEDium. I know that a lot about you guys talked about obviously you have remediation efforts going on in Memphis but you are volunteering -- voluntarily making investments in the other facilities. Can you give us an update there? Or are we done in those facilities as well? And at this point is the issues with the FDA is still solely in Memphis. And the other facilities are there no issues there. Can you just give us a sense of what's going on the other side, because you had done more there on your own? Thanks.","James Cleary","Sure. We are continuing to make investments in the other facilities. We're investing in additional procedures and additional testing and so production levels are somewhat lower at the other three facilities.","Charles Rhyee","But is there a timeline for when you expect those to be finished so that we see sort of a normalization in the production on those facilities?","James Cleary","Sure. It's ongoing in process and we haven't given a specific timeline.","Steven Collis","Yes. Just to hate [ph] the PharMEDium discussion, we\u2019ve always target [ph] this as under 10% of the AmerisourceBergen profits at its peak. We've said that to you in the past, so probably I think there's so many other important things to talk about with AmerisourceBergen and our performance in our segment. So we probably said as much as we want to say on PharMEDium. Clearly we will be judged by the success of the radiation and our ability to get back in good stead with regulators. Probably, those of who are asking questions we probably done on this subject for the moment.","James Cleary","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. I won\u2019t ask on PharMEDium. And so you\u2019ve successfully surrounded yourself and establish strong relationships with larger customers that supporting volume or supporting overall growth. But from a profit perspective and excluding PharMEDium I guess can you speak to that quarterly cadence? And do you think you have enhanced overall visibility on that core Pharma segment profit growth over the next several quarters just given clarity around whether it be drug pricing or the regulatory environment? Thanks.","Steven Collis","Thanks for the question. We are -- we're very proud of the performance of our Pharma distribution. I think our customer\u2019s growth and volume speak for themselves and the market is healthy. We have some trends that the next quarter is obviously generally our largest reported earnings quarter and we see no reason that that should discontinue. Brand and generic, brand inflation was probably modest where we expected it. Maybe a little bit softer than last year for sure. And we wouldn't be surprised if those trends continued given the political pressure that is on brand process. And I think that the lack of understanding about the growth was net process, there was actually a good article published in The Wall Street Journal this week on that. So we felt we feel good about that.","On generic deflation, we heard a lot of pronouncements at the JPMorgan conference about that turning still. It's still fairly still fairly high. Generic deflation is still mid to high single-digits. And we haven't called that out anymore because we've now had several years of that and we talking about that as a trade. So we are \u2013 we\u2019re driving in this environment. We're doing well. We\u2019re reporting good numbers. We have a stable customer base and we expect to be able to continue to report on along the lines to what our guidance has been. And we'll start work in the next couple of months on our fiscal year 2020 [ph] and hope to be able to share those updates as they -- as we make progress with you. So I think that answer your question. Jim, did you anything different.","James Cleary","Sure, Steve. Yes. I\u2019ll addresses that and what I\u2019ll add is that, with our guidance of operating income growth now low single-digit spend and the difference between low single-digits and mid single-digits is the PharMEDium headwind. And so, we are seeing as you say good performance out of the core businesses. And addition to the things, Steve talked about, we're focusing on the H.D. Smith synergies and we're seeing very strong performance in our specialty businesses.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then if I could just add that sort of a quick question on Animal Health. Could you provide the normalized growth excluding agency buy sell shift and Jim, I know you're familiar with the Mars business. But can you speak to your relationship with corporate accounts such as Banfield, VCA and others as well as contract internship from vendors potentially this year? Thanks.","James Cleary","Yes, sure. So there are a couple questions there that we're going to look at growth without the shift from buy sell to agency. There was growth in the companion animal business that kind of be that low single-digit or so growth in the companion animal business. So a little bit -- a little bit down in the Production Animal business because of delayed cattle movements which probably catches up and like December, January, February, lot of details there. But I\u2019d say that, with regard to our expanded relationship with Morris, I don\u2019t think that that should really come as a surprise.","We have a 20 plus year really strong relationship with Banfield and with Morris through that Banfield relationship. And we're just always focused with them on working together to find more ways, to create value together commercially. And so, we're very pleased to expand that relationship. But given the very long-term relationship I don't think it should really come as a surprise.","Bennett Murphy","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Maybe a gross margin question and I'll start with. If we look at the disclosures now required on brand increases in California, I imagine five or six years ago that would have created an opportunity to forward buy. Is that today effectively nonexistent because of the way the DSAs are structured? Or does that -- did that create -- does that create any opportunity?","Steven Collis","Eric, great question, and you're right five or six years ago that would have been more so -- even more so in this, because five or six years ago the increases were more profound. But now we have these very bilateral transparent relationships on inventory levels with the overwhelming majority of our manufacturers. So, no, it's doesn't. And I think we did see some of this and that was more around an indication of what would be happening around January. So that was helpful to us, but not a real positive financial impact from that.","Bennett Murphy","But we will say one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my call. So, just wanted to ask clarification on guidance. To make sure that we understand it, should we seeing that guidance in the March quarter that EPS is going to be or that EBIT is going to be down because there is still a headwind from medium and we don't have the year-over-year benefit from H.D. Smith? And then second half of the year we should expect to see acceleration is PharMEDium is no longer a headwind. And if that's the case, I know, Jim you said that you're assuming some additional branded drug price increases later on in the year?","So are you guys assuming that we go back to kind of like more historical [Indiscernible], I know last year was an interesting year, 90% of price increases happened in the March quarter. But do you think that was an anomaly and that we should go back to more normal trending this year?","Steven Collis","Yes. And so, we are doing orderly guidance, but as I indicated during the call, what we are saying is that the second quarter EPS is likely to be relatively flat versus the second quarter last year. And kind of some of the things that drive that in the second quarter are much smaller headwind, but still a headwind from PharMEDium. And then also there'll be some of little bit lower compensation from brand manufacturers compared to last year during the second quarter. But I think also in your question you're asking about branded inflation overall and directionally it's as expected.","When we did guidance we indicated mid single-digits in FY 2019 and that's still what we're expecting. And of course can't talk about this without going back and saying that 95% of our buy side dollars are fee-for-service. So we're talking about this incremental 5% when we when we talked about this. And so January is a little bit lighter than a prior year, but we're still seeing mid single digits in our slide 2019 guidance and feel good about that.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you, Steve.","Steven Collis","Here\u2019s everyone, well thank you. I certainly, Jim and myself and the rest of the management team we certainly take responsibility for PharMEDium which we're not trying to avoid any discussion. We just want it to be proportional and we recognize it's an overhang to our results. And we really also would appreciate your focusing on the overall strength throughout AmerisourceBergen whole businesses, for example, our resumption to growth and profitability, strong profitability action and other areas including our international development.","But our core business has scale efficiency, valuable partnerships, we're a channel. We try to point out how a few areas where the channel could be of great value to our manufacturer partners and all stakeholders, our leadership in specialty which has been almost two decades now that continues to be strong and innovative. And we have -- finally we have a very strong balance sheet where we've been excellent stewards of shareholders capital. So we leave you with the thought that AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to continue to create shareholder value and thank you for your time and attention today. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconferencing services.

As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over to our host Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's March quarter fiscal year 2016 results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO of AmerisourceBergen; and Tim Gutman, Executive Vice President and CFO of AmerisourceBergen.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations including, without limitation, revenue, operating margin and taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. We remind you that there were very many uncertainties and risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","For a discussion of some key risk factors and other cautionary statements, we refer you to our SEC filings including our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 as well as our quarterly and other filings with the SEC. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business.

Those connected by phone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks. We have a lot of material to cover this morning; so our comments will be slightly longer than normal, but we will leave ample time for questions. Now here is Steve Collis.","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that while we delivered solid performance in our March quarter, we are disappointed that the forecasts we have presented for the second half of our fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 fall below our historical rates of performance. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our industry and our company and we are well positioned with the right customers and the right portfolio of services for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders.","Certain areas of our business are performing very well, including both of our recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our specialty group, including the distribution businesses that serve physicians and our consulting businesses, had a very strong March quarter.","In addition, we recently achieved two key customer renewals or extensions in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, including a three-year extension with our strategic long-term partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and a one-year extension with Express Scripts, our second largest customer.","ABDC has, however, been adversely impacted by several factors, including accelerating deflation on generic drugs and a lower contribution from generic launches. These unanticipated trends have exasperated the expected impact from a shift in product mix towards lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs, as well as the lack of generic inflation we discussed in our Q1 call.","As we work through these challenges, our overall earnings growth rate will slow somewhat. Tim will discuss the March quarter results and walk through our detailed guidance for the second half of fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017. Then I will outline the ways we intend to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that are in front of us before we open the call to Q&A.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted.","Also, let me point out that after this quarter, we fully anniversary the impact of adding MWI to our consolidated financial results. My comments will be a little lengthier this morning, as I have a fair amount to cover in three primary areas.","First, I will recap our fiscal Q2 consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our revised fiscal 2016 expectations. And third, I will provide some brief commentary on how we are thinking about fiscal 2017. Even though it's early, we will provide initial thoughts in a few key areas. With that, we can begin our fiscal Q2 review.","Revenues were $35.7 billion, up 9.3%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continues to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix; our two acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium combined, accounted for roughly 2% of our consolidated revenue growth. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 12% to $1.2 billion. The dollar growth was due to our two acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, specifically the drug company, was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. They continued to experience headwinds from contract renewals and lower generic inflation.","Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 18% to $575 million. Roughly 80% of the increase was related to our two acquisitions. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these two companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been about 4%.","As you have come to expect from ABC, we are prudent with expense spending. This has always been one of ABC's core operating practices and it will remain so going forward.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $592 million, up about $40 million or 7%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.66%, down three basis points from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down eight basis points this quarter.","Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $31 million, up significantly from last year, due entirely to the financing costs of the MWI and PharMEDium acquisitions.","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. This quarter's rate includes a one-time rate benefit of 1.4% from adjusting our estimated year-to-date tax rate, specifically related to an expansion of our international operations which are taxed at a lower rate. We now expect our full-year tax rate to be approximately 33%.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.68, driven mostly by the income from our two recent acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, from our lower consolidated tax rate. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 229 million shares, down some from last year.","This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution.","Total segment revenues were $34.2 billion, up nearly 8%. Our drug company had a growth rate of about 6%. This growth was net of a revenue headwind of about 2% due to lower Hepatitis C sales in the market and also a transfer of certain oncology sales to our specialty business. Drug company had solid growth across its chain customers, including Walgreens and also in our Hospital segment.","Our Specialty Business Group had another outstanding quarter with revenue increasing about 18%, driven mostly by volume growth. Similar to last quarter, we continue to have meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across a few of our businesses and also from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Specialty Medical business.","ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for roughly 20% of specialty revenue growth, primarily due to a new manufacturer relationship they added late last year. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our Specialty Group. We continue to be very pleased with their performance. They clearly help to differentiate ABC from the rest of the market.","Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $882 million, up about $33 million or about 4%. The majority of the growth in gross profit dollars was in our drug company, specifically the benefit from PharMEDium. Excluding the acquisition benefit, drug company was behind last year's gross profit due to the headwinds I called out previously, the tough comparison on drug price inflation and contract renewals.","Segment operating income was $498 million and was up 2%. Our Specialty business continued with our high level of performance, offset by the lower performance of our drug company.","Before I finish on the segment, let me comment this was our first full quarter of reporting PharMEDium. Financially, they are contributing better than we expected as a result of strong operational performance. For the quarter, volume growth, as a percentage, was in the mid-teens. The business has integrated especially well into the drug company. We are off to a great start with PharMEDium. We can now move to our other segment which includes MWI Consulting Services and World Courier.","In the March quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. As a reminder, our March 2015 quarterly results included about five weeks of MWI's operating results. Growth in just Consulting and World Courier combined was about 13%. These businesses continue to grow their top-line revenue, primarily as a result of providing additional services and growing volumes with existing customers, which is a clear indicator of customer satisfaction and value.","MWI continued to perform especially well. Percentage revenue growth in the Companion Animal segment in the low teens and we saw a nice recovery in the Production Animal segment with percentage revenue growth in the high single digits.","From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $94 million. MWI contributed a significant amount of the dollar increase. Our Consulting business also had excellent income growth in the quarter.","The segment's operating margin was down about 60 basis points. This is the result of MWI becoming a much larger percentage of the results and having a lower margin in comparison to the two other businesses within the Other segment.","During the March quarter, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of acquiring MWI. We want to thank Jim Cleary and the entire MWI team for an outstanding first year. We continue to be impressed with the passion and knowledge that our associates demonstrate every day, partnering with our customers and the manufacturers. And importantly, the MWI's business has outperformed our first-year financial expectations. They are on strong footing and on track to deliver the long-term returns we anticipated.","I'd like to switch over now and cover a few key working capital and cash flow items. In the March quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $790 million. This quarter historically has been our strongest cash quarter of the year as we cycle through the seasonal inventory builds from calendar year-end. At March 31, we had roughly $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes roughly $400 million offshore related primarily to our World Courier and Switzerland businesses.","During the quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization. As noted in this morning's press release, we announced that our board authorized a new, regular share repurchase program that, together with the availability under the existing share program, permits us to purchase up to $750 million of our shares.","Also back in mid-March, we filed an 8-K announcing that Walgreens exercised their 2016 stock warrants through our hedging program as we committed. We successfully offset the EPS dilutive impact from the 23 million shares issued to Walgreens.","In conjunction with its hedging program, the company, through an Investment Bank, executed call options to purchase ABC shares. The funding of the call option transaction was not entirely completed in the March quarter. We paid $218 million to the Investment Bank in the March quarter. And the remaining amount, $483 million, was paid to the bank in April.","Moving to our revised fiscal 2016 expectations. I must acknowledge that revising our adjusted EPS guidance downward a second time is very disappointing to us. Adverse market trends centered around generic pricing have become more acute than we anticipated. And our strategic initiative to offset some of these pressures has not yet yielded the results we expected. While generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of generic drug deflation is slowly increasing and is higher than the level we previously expected in fiscal 2016 and expected to get slightly worse by year-end. This is driven in part by the increased supply of generic product in the channel.","While we are protected from inventory losses on deflationary products, it's difficult to continue to earn the same gross profit dollars on decreasing prices. We have had some success in being made whole through new incentives or rebates or by increasing generic sales volumes, but we are not always 100% successful in achieving this.","Combined with this, our gross profit contributions from new generic launches are decreasing as brand manufacturers increasingly find ways to protect and retain market share.","Additionally, after several years of a favorable branded generic revenue mix in our drug company business, this trend is starting to reverse. As more lower margin branded specialty drugs shift primarily to hospitals and specialty pharmacies through full-line distribution in our drug company, these revenues do not currently provide enough gross profit dollars to overcome the decline in generic drug gross profit.","With regard to our strategic initiative, our drug company about a year ago set forth on a strategic initiative to grow its independent retail business, and in conjunction with this, grow pro-generics revenues. The business added new management and additional resources, made investments in innovative programs and aligned internal incentives. We expect to see meaningful progress in our June and September 2016 quarters from these investments and efforts. While we are making progress, the financial contribution is ramping slower than anticipated.","Based on the two headwinds that I've covered and the negative impact from previously disclosed contract renewals, the drug company's fiscal 2016 operating income will be lower on a year-over-year basis, even with PharMEDium included.","Our revised fiscal 2016 P&L guidance is as follows: Revenues, we are now guiding to ABC consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8% for the full fiscal year. Operating income, we expect growth in consolidated operating income to be in the range of 5% to 6% as a result of the lower second-half expectations and lower-than-expected performance of our drug company. Included in this growth is the benefit from measures we plan to take to reduce our expense structure going forward.","Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.44 to $5.54, which is growth of 10% to 12%.","As I just highlighted, our EPS range includes the benefit of several cents from expense reductions we will be implementing in the second half of this fiscal year. I'd like to now cover our revised guidance on free cash flow and also share repurchases. This morning, we issued a separate press release announcing our contract amendment with our largest customer, Walgreens. As we disclosed, we've entered into a three-year contract extension with our anchor partner for both the distribution agreement and the generic sourcing agreement. In the past, we have disclosed that this customer accounted for about 30% of our consolidated revenues.","In our view, there are a few customers that have both the scale and growth profile like Walgreens. The relationship, now in its fourth year, has exceeded our initial financial projections and has provided an excellent return to our shareholders.","In exchange for the extensions, we agreed to make additional working capital and infrastructure investments during the next several months and also into fiscal 2017. Some of these investments, including carrying extra inventory to maximize service levels, have recently started. Because of these working capital investments, we are now revising our free cash flow guidance to $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year; and this now includes the tax benefit from the 2016 warrant exercise.","For share repurchases, using a portion of the cash from the warrant exercise, we expect to increase our repurchases which will now total between $350 million and $450 million. As always, share repurchases are subject to change depending on market conditions, our second half of the year cash position and other competing capital needs.","The third and final topic I want to cover this morning is commentary on our fiscal 2017 outlook. Since we changed our assumptions around the second half of fiscal 2015, we thought it was important to provide a preliminary look at next year fiscal 2017. Revenues, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to be slightly better than market, operating income, the headwinds that I called out related to the second half of fiscal 2016 will continue well into fiscal 2017. Also, we do expect to have headwinds from both the Kaiser and TPA contract renewals for half of the fiscal year.","Consequently, our drug company's operating income is expected to be up just slightly and this includes solid growth from PharMEDium. Adjusted EPS growth, we expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our revised fiscal 2016 guidance range.","I should highlight that the 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth is net of a 3% headwind for the incremental expenses to support key business investments in IT systems and infrastructure. These investments support our growth, drive customer satisfaction and further increase our operating efficiency. We expect to realize meaningful expense savings from these incremental investments of at least $30 million annually beginning in fiscal 2019. The preliminary view of our fiscal 2017 outlook includes several key assumptions as follows:","One, we are expecting generic drug deflation to be in the high single digits by fiscal year end 2016 and more importantly, we are forecasting that generic drug deflation will stay in this range for the entire fiscal 2017.","Two, our tax rate will be slightly lower in fiscal 2017. Three, we have limited capital deployments in our adjusted EPS range. We plan to complete enough share repurchases to offset stock option exercises.","Four that we retain Kaiser, an important customer of the drug company. Five, we are not including any new business, resulting from our relationship with our largest customer; Six, we've not included any impacts from the proposed TMS Medicare Part D reimbursement proposal as it's too early to ascertain the likelihood that this will be successfully implemented; and Seven, we are not assuming a meaningful contribution from biosimilars.","Moving to free cash flow, preliminary guidance and cash availability. As I mentioned earlier, we have agreed to make working capital investments as a result of the Walgreens contract amendment. The working capital impact is greater in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016. Also, the impact primarily affects the first half of our fiscal 2017. We anticipate that our capital spend will increase as we invest in our drug distribution network due to age of the network and also to increase capacity. Additionally, we are making key IT platform investments in our Consulting and World Courier businesses, both have older systems that are inefficient and costly.","As a result of these investments, we expect that our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 will be approximately equal to or just slightly below our adjusted net income. An important point: once we cycle through the impacts from the Walgreens working capital investments and the higher CapEx in fiscal 2017, our aspirational goal in fiscal 2018 and beyond would be to have free cash flow of at least 125% of net income each year, assuming over time we maintain our current terms with customers and suppliers.","From a cash availability standpoint, I should mention that we expect our offshore cash to continue to increase in fiscal 2017 as a result of our international businesses. The final item I will cover is the future exercise of the 2017 warrants. Because of our hedging strategy, we are fully covered from any potential adjusted EPS dilutions when our share price is $88 or lower. We will certainly monitor this as we progress towards the exercise window, which is March 2017 to September 2017.","As a reminder, roughly 60% of the warrant proceeds will be used to exercise our Capped Call Options with the Investment Bank and purchase shares needed to successfully complete the hedge. The remaining proceeds are expected to be used to repay the 2017 bond that we originally issued in connection with the hedging program.","As I close my comments, we are on a different trajectory for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and also for fiscal 2017 than we had originally anticipated. However, we are well positioned to navigate through a challenging environment, drive efficiencies and thoughtfully deploy capital in a manner that drives long-term shareholder value.","Now, I will turn it back to Steve.","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tim. As we look ahead to the second half of our fiscal year and into next year, there is no doubt that we have some challenging work ahead as we navigate the headwinds that Tim outlined. But I am certain that we have the right team in place, not only to meet this near-term challenge, but also to ensure that we do not lose sight of the many long-term opportunities that are ahead of us.","Let's look at each of the foundational pieces of our business more closely. We are very fortunate to be heavily weighted to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry where the organic market growth rate is expected to be 7% to 8% over the next several years. This is an extremely significant benefit that our industry enjoys and all U.S. wholesalers are beneficiaries of this market growth, especially to the extent that it is being driven by demographics and improving access to care.","Market growth in the U.S. is also driven by new brand product introductions, both in more traditional therapies and in innovative specialty products and to a lesser extent by branded drug inflation. Of course going forward, there will be less erosion at the top line from new generic launches. The large U.S. wholesalers together comprise the most efficient distribution network in the world and provide tremendous value to the pharmaceutical supply channel. AmerisourceBergen has distinguished itself within this accomplished group with its portfolio of services for specialty and biotech manufacturers and for the healthcare providers that administer these innovative products. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs and these products are vital to all of our customers. The economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider.","In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by a physician that is treating a patient in a community setting because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider.","While the prices of some of these specialty drugs get a lot of attention, we should not lose sight of the fact that these products treat extremely serious illnesses. In many cases, there are life-saving products or life-changing drugs that make a previously intractable disease manageable. While we certainly understand the need to manage the cost of care, the physicians and other healthcare providers who treat the sickest patients should not themselves be economically harmed simply by choosing the best available therapy for their patient. As someone who's been working around community physicians, including oncologists for over 20 years, I want to comment specifically on CMS's proposed demonstration project on Part D drugs.","There is little evidence, if any, that physicians are systematically and inappropriately prescribing expensive therapy. The proposal ignores the reimbursement challenges physician already face on many Part D medications such as those that remain in place as a result of sequestration. The cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant and the unintended consequences of further reductions should be carefully studied because it is the patient that will bear the ultimate burden both in terms of the economics and in terms of the quality of their lives. We are hopeful that the issues with the proposal will be addressed and that it will not be implemented in its current form.","Turning back to our business, the portfolio of services we offer applies broadly to potentially all pharmaceuticals. And going forward, we will move to a pricing model that is more balanced between generics and brand products.","Today, the basic logistics of warehousing and distributing the products is the bedrock of what we do and the additional services we provide have greatly differentiated our place in the market. We can meet the needs of pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers at virtually every point in its lifecycle, from the clinical trial phase through commercialization as a brand and into patient and product support for mature therapies and eventually through the launch of generic or biosimilar versions of products.","The portfolio of offerings we have built over the last decade will be even more important in a market that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiencies. Solid organic market growth and the right portfolio of services are critical components of increasing revenues. But to take full advantage of those cornerstones, we need to be aligned with the right customers and this is another area where I believe we excel. AmerisourceBergen has an unparalleled group of marquee customers with whom we've established long-term relationships. As both Tim and I mentioned earlier, we are thrilled to extend our innovative and highly successful partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance and we look forward to continuing to reap the mutual benefits of this unique and collaborative relationship well beyond the original 10-year term. This relationship has greatly benefited both parties and has financially exceeded our expectations.","I'm also pleased that Express Scripts has decided to exercise their option to extend their current contract for an additional year. We've been working with this market-leading pharmacy benefit manager for the last four years and we continue to look for new ways we can partner together to drive value for the long term. We now have several of our largest customers in each of our key segments under long-term contract and we hope that we will soon be able to say the same about Kaiser Permanente. Over many years, we have deliberately chosen specific customers whom we believe would be on the cutting edge of pharmaceutical care and therefore grow faster than the market over the long run. In addition to the three customers already mentioned, we renewed our largest independent GPO customer CPA during the quarter. And of course we have our largest government contract, the Department of Defense also on a long-term contract.","This strategy has already paid dividends and will continue to do so for many years to come. Our focus on high-quality customers is not limited to just the very largest in the marketplace. We have extensive relationships with food and drug retailers, institutions and other types of healthcare providers of various shapes and sizes and have long been champions of both independent community pharmacy and have specialty physicians in community practice, for example. We will continue to make investments to ensure that we meet specific site of care needs as well as to serve providers who integrate offerings across different channels. And I think that AmerisourceBergen is the best positioned in the market to deliver meaningful innovation in these areas.","Another key customer group is of course our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. Our extensive array of manufacturer services businesses are another meaningful differentiator for ABC and these businesses are and will continue to be among the fastest growing in our company. Whether we are working on clinical trial logistics in World Courier, working on reimbursement and commercialization strategies within our Consulting business or supporting patient assistance programs built around some of the more complex therapies, I believe the suite of services will only become more valuable in the future. As manufacturers must demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness and patient adherence becomes more essential and less exceptional and complex biosimilars are launched into the marketplace, AmerisourceBergen will be the partner of choice.","Serving customers well is absolutely required in today's market and we must continue to do so in the most efficient manner possible. While our expenses have increased in recent years and will continue to rise somewhat as we integrate our recent acquisitions and make some additional investments in our information technology systems and other infrastructure, I want to assure you that we remain focused on being the most efficient operator in the industry. As cost pressures increase across the board in healthcare, it is even more important that we manage our own with an increasingly higher degree of precision than we've done historically. We have always skillfully run lean operations. This is an area where we need to apply even greater creativity and sensitivity to what needs to be done to meet the needs of customers in a way we can strip out unproductive expenses. This is a process that never ends and it is important to remember that the investments we are making today will ultimately lower our cost of doing business in the future.","As we grow our revenues, efficiently run our operations and cycle through the working capital investments that Tim discussed, we expect to be able to generate strong cash flow over the long term. This has long been a hallmark of our business and is one of the key ways in which we have driven shareholder value.","We remain committed to being excellent stewards of capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to have a balanced approach to deploying our cash going forward. Our track record in this area is very strong. We have had successful internal products like BluePoint, the NDC, National Distribution Center, and more recently, Certio. In addition, we have made very successful strategic investments in three market leaders: World Courier, MWI Animal Health, formerly Veterinary Supply, and PharMEDium. These three large acquisitions have strengthened our business in key areas and all of them have exceeded our expectations in terms of their operational and financial performance and have yielded important strategic benefits. Looking ahead, we will continue to look for high-quality assets in the pharmaceutical channel that have great potential to deliver long-term value. In addition, of course, we will continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","In the near term, we remain committed to offsetting the potential dilution from the exercise of the 2017 warrant and over the longer term, we will be as thoughtful and resourceful with our capital deployment as we have always been since inception of AmerisourceBergen.","In summary, while we are disappointed in our near-term forecasts, I hope all of our stakeholders share my great conviction and confidence in our AmerisourceBergen franchise. Our management team, our portfolio offerings and our collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger. As I've said on many occasions, while we focus on delivering short-term results, we are obsessed with delivering long-term performance that reflects ABC's excellent position, thought leadership and customer focus. Ultimately, it is our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management that would help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.","Now we'll turn it over to Barbara to begin Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you, Steve. We will now open the call to questions. This morning, we will ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can accommodate as many callers as possible. Please go ahead, Lori.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Steve and Tim. So it sounds like you're calling for high single-digit deflation as we leave your fiscal 2016 and enter your fiscal 2017. I guess two-parter. How does that compare to what you're seeing currently in the marketplace from a generic deflation standpoint? And then, Tim, I think it would be really helpful if you could give us some sense, even order of magnitude of what kind of impact to the P&L should we be thinking about if you're talking about mid-single-digit deflation moving to high-single-digit deflation?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Bob, for the question. I'll start with the first part of your question. I mean I would say that to give a perspective on us, where we're at today, at the end of March quarter, we were probably mid-single-digit deflation. That changed \u2013 that definitely changed on us from where we communicated to the Street and to our investors and stakeholders back on Q1. It was probably very low single digit; so that moved against us by the time we got to March. And as we forecast out for the balance of the year, we expect that to increase some. And that's \u2013 again we think that's related to just more supply in the channel. And certainly, we factor that into thinking that's going to remain so into 2017. And it's a headwind and I'm not going to comment on dollars. But we sell a lot of generics through our Pro program. And again when you do the math, a 1% change in deflation and having lower GP dollars is certainly a headwind that we have to work through.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. So, I just want to go back to one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks. I think you talked about kind of like changing the pricing model in contract (40:27) of your internal model. Now you seem to have inflation. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on this? Are you also seeing changes in pricing model in your interaction with your customers, your pharmacies and also any kind of buyers? What does it really mean?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we've had a real long-term, for several years now, tailwind from the generic patent expirations and that's been a great benefit. We're talking now specifically about the drug company; it's obviously a bit different in our specialty business and very different in, say, our Veterinary or PharMEDium business. But what we try and accomplish in the long term is a better balancing contribution between brand, generic and specialty therapies which would include biosimilars and precision medicine products and cell-based therapies. So all of these new innovative products we expect to get a fair return on. And that's a discussion we're having with our customers and definitely a discussion we're having with manufacturers as well. Now the reality is that the sell side takes time to catch up with the buy side. And by sell side, we mean the contracts that we have with providers. So we've seen some very rapid changes in the marketplace with \u2013 probably, we believe growth in the industry will be driven more by innovation than by inflation on established products even if they're not subject to generic competition.","So, it's very important that we have all these product categories be profitable for us and that's what we really are talking about. And I think AmerisourceBergen, with Bob Mauch's leadership and the very strong strategic approach to customers, we've taken a lead in this and you'll see that reflected in our contracts over the long term.","Operator","And our next question, Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Steve, thanks so much from you and Tim in giving us some thoughts around 2017. But what I really want to understand is your more broad-based thoughts. As we think about core revenue in your distribution business, you just talked about the changing model. You've talked about the changes around new product innovation versus increasing prices on existing products. But could we see a period of time where perhaps your revenue growth is greater than your EBIT growth because of some of these factors that are impacting the model? And how do you think about EBIT just given your customer base, given some of the things that you're talking about over the next couple of years?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Lisa, thank you for the question. It's a mix of customer base that we have including being with some of the fastest growers like WBA. And our target is specialty market including we do a lot of specialty pharmacy business in our core drug wholesale business. We do expect to grow our revenue slightly above the market. And then because we have a strong association or weighting towards those larger customers and because of the mixes that we see, we don't expect to be able to keep our gross profit growth up with that revenue growth. But we do expect that we're going to have operating leverage because of the different investments that we're making. So there will be scale coming from that and we are moving ahead rapidly with integrating MWI and PharMEDium, which has really severely impacted our expense rate. Another good benefit that we have is our improving tax rate and then I think ABC is accelerating capital deployment not only on acquisitions, but on buying shares back at the right time.","And this is my 20th quarter. And I think when I did my first quarter, we were in the mid to high 30%s and so we've done very, very well with that. Something that I'm very proud of and we talked on the call about (44:31) and our National Replenishment Center. These projects \u2013 BluePoint, these projects have really been outstanding. And then you know it's \u2013 again depending on what happens in the market and how cash flow progresses and we are forecasting in the long run 125%; that's quite implicit in Tim's comments. So we would have the opportunities and certainly at lower spot prices as share repo becomes a lot more compelling to us. So those will be the drivers for our long-term growth model.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Steve or Tim, you're able to sign a three-year extension with Walgreens which had six or seven years left on the deal, but only a one-year extension with Express Scripts. I guess they exercised the option there. But what's the barrier to negotiating a long-term deal there? Is the nature of the negotiations changing? And then secondarily, you comment on the working capital requirements that's inventory. Have any of the payment terms changed? That's where you've made more of your recent progress? Is Walgreens demanding different terms now?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start off. Bob, first of all, it's a pity you couldn't have your daughter on the phone with us. And second of all, it's very strange welcome to Credit Suisse folks so good to hear from you. So at Express Scripts, again, the first time I met George, he came to me, I didn't really know AmerisourceBergen. So I think we've made tremendous progress with Express Scripts. The relationship is into its fifth year. The teams meet regularly. We have dedicated representation therein. We're going to work very hard to sign a new contract with them over the next 12 months. And I think this is \u2013 I think anybody would agree with me that this is a very active market with a lot going on. And so \u2013 but I do think that the companies are strategically aligned and I expect we'll be able to renew the contract.","As far as WBA, I'll let Tim comment further. But clearly, a lot of the people that are not in our industry on a daily basis, I'm getting all these emails and texts this morning, wow, you did a $400 billion deal with WBA; and we should not take that for granted. I mean, these are the people who like saying, well, everything else that we announced today. But there's just not any other customer probably in the world like this. And we did a historic agreement. This is the first time we've significantly renegotiated any of the other elements of the contract and they did a lot of things that both parties wanted to find out, including the opportunity to enjoy new business with WBA. So we did make some amendments and I'll let Tim comment further. But that's really the gist of what we have to say. Tim, anything you'd add?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks Steve. Bob, now your question, we have agreed to invest in working capital. A fair amount is extra inventory; we want to make sure we maximize our service levels, which again, as you think about it, there is also an impact to all of our customers to make sure we always have appropriate inventory. We're never out and it also helps buffer against any kind of disruption in the supply chain or shortages. But we are also making some incremental changes in terms of \u2013 on the accounts being phased in, their payment terms to us.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. So can you give a little bit more color on the 180-day exclusivity commentary. It's sort of an interesting dynamic change and we haven't heard this in general from all of your peers. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of it is sort of a change at the branded manufacturer that you think is sustainable? How much of it is the current environment and how you foresee that sort of evolving because clearly that's been a big profit driver at times for the wholesalers?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ross, I'll jump in and start and Steve can also help. But I would say in my commentary, I talked about maybe a different trend in the market that has started and seem to be progressing and that's brand manufacturers are retaining market share through co-pay cards and maybe some rebates. And I would say in the past when we converted to a generic, we saw pretty high immediate penetration rates in the market, upwards of maybe 90%. Now when we convert on a generic, we see penetration rates that are more 50% or 60% and that puts some pressure on generic profitability on launches. So that is definitely what we see. And that's just, I think, an evolution of the market and just something we have to work through. Generics are still profitable. But again, I would say as we stand here today, looking out this year for some launches and even into next year, we're signaling that they just might not contribute to the level we expected.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Tim.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Our next question, please.","Operator","We'll go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I have a question on the pricing discussion and pricing model discussion. If we go back historically, specialty was treated as brand and maybe years ago, it should've been a separate class like generics. As we get to today, I expect that it's the larger customers, the Walgreens, the Expresses where you're serving specialty through the traditional distribution channel that they're really driving pressure on margins. So, my question is how will you go about trying to change this and where do you get leverage, maybe not just with those two customers, but across the channel to change specialty pricing and margin and in the traditional wholesale business, where there's been a move toward net-net pricing?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Eric, that is an excellent question. And actually if I was a revisionist, I agree with you that the specialty should've been a step Expresses way (51:01). But I think in a way, because we had the patent expiration opportunity for several years, that sort of covered for the weighting of specialty drugs. So the way we're going to get through this is through communication and trust. We have a very well demonstrated strain that we are, I think, are doing an outstanding job as an industry of explaining this strain. I think people understand it as well. It's well understood as to how the industry is changing and it just makes sense because the price of these products and the value that they represent is very different than traditional oral solid brand medications and also they apply to smaller patient populations and there's complex standing requirements, complex reimbursements. So AmerisourceBergen has been in this for a long time.","So recently, at a strategic review for our Specialty Group, they made a very interesting observation that I think is pertinent. And it's really that the brand \u2013 the Specialty business has become the brand business and the future specialty businesses will be orphan drugs, biosimilars, precision medicine, cell-based therapies. I think actually AmerisourceBergen will excel and differentiate ourselves. But Bob Mauch and his team, as I've said earlier, and also Peyton Howell on our GSMR side, our global supply chain side, are really focused on talking to manufacturers about this strain, making sure we get fair reimbursement. And we need to talk to \u2013 we are talking not only to the Walgreens and the Express Scripts, but we have a big specialty pharmacy customer base.","We have a big alternate care customer base. We have a big health system and hospital GPO customer base and all of these customers need to really move along. And as we get through the contracting phase, it is our strong intention that we will make a profit on specialty drugs and innovative therapies, whatever the site of care is.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thanks. Next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking the questions. One is just a follow-up on the prior question, I think it was to Ross's where \u2013 on the generic launches, expecting lower contribution, is there any way you can quantify it so that we can get a better appreciation for the new level of conservatism because I think that that will be useful? But my question, if you allow that to not account for my one is that on the pro-generics commentary, I wouldn't have thought that a slow ramp in pro-generics and increasing independent retail sales would've made a big enough dent into EPS guidance to call it out? So could you maybe give us a little bit more on how much of the change in EPS is attributable to this phenomenon? And I guess what exactly didn't go to plan and what are you assuming for fiscal 2017?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, just \u2013 Garen, thanks for the question. So at the beginning of February, we really dealt with the lack of generic price inflation. And what we're calling out now \u2013 and that's probably and we lowered our range. What we're talking \u2013 Tim can give you more color, but approximately two-thirds of the lower forecast, we would say, is really environmental and then approximately one-third is from not getting to the growth target that we expected in pro-gen. Now it's interesting because as you can imagine, we've dug very deep into this and our unit sales are not off that much.","It really is the generic deflation and the lower average selling prices on a lot of the generics that are not causing our generic sales and the weighting that that implies to be as high as we anticipated, honestly even in February. And that's about a third of the miss along with what we've seen in the last quarter and the next few quarters, which is that generic efficiency rate that we're experiencing as a wholesaler. It doesn't mean that the market's not being as efficient. It just means that we are only seeing about that 50% conversion. So we've definitely lost a couple of percent of anticipated earnings from generic launches. And also even in our specialty group there was a big launch we were expecting that we did not perceive as well. So it's nice being a year that we receive the benefits from generic launches that we expected. But, Tim, anything to add to these?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Steve. I would just say, Garen, I don't think we'd want to give any more color on the impact from the launches and what that means to us. I think it's just fair to say that they're less than what we expected. And when we only have a handful in a year and they're less than expected, that's a challenge for you. And as Steve mentioned, we thought we'd make up some ground on the pro-independent side. And as everybody knows, generics are profitable for us, P&L and cash flow. And that was a headwind for us in the second half of the year. 2017, I think one part of your question is on 2017. What does 2017 include? We expect to see some progress and some growth in 2017, a reasonable amount.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. Next question, please.","Operator","Yes. We go to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I'm going to ask two. I guess the first one is just kind of a bullet point. I doubt you'll answer, but it would be very helpful. Could you tell us what percent of your total revenue is generics today? Get us up to speed on how that's changed with the Walgreens relationships and other client moves.","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I actually don't have that number at the time. But I think you're right we would give it. What is important to us with Walgreens and we've said this many times is that we do all the prescription medications for them. And that includes both brand and generics, and that really was a big sea change in the industry and has led to discussions around generic distribution and generic sourcing with all of our customers. So that's what's been extremely important. In brand, the wholesale industry has well over the 90% coverage.","And in generics, it's a lot less because there still are opportunities and this is an opportunity for us to do more generic distribution with self-warehousing customers. So that is definitely something we think of as an opportunity. And since the Walgreens transaction was announced, almost anyone's at least open to that discussion. So that's been a positive in our whole industry, not just for us, but for our peers as well.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Eric, are you still on the line?","Operator","We'll open the line. Just a moment. Eric, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good, great. Thanks. Steve's comment, it kind of led into my second question which is, you mentioned a couple of times with these working capital step-ups and investments you're making on behalf of Walgreens, that you're hoping to do more business with them. But I guess my confusion is I thought you already had all of the business with them. So I'm not sure exactly what the incremental opportunity is other than them bringing on acquisitions. And you did state earlier that you're not factoring in an acquisition-driven revenue increase. So I'm kind of confused. Are you talking about doing front-end? Or what exactly are you doing since you're doing all the brands, all the specialty and all of the generics?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think what we said is that it's a historic relationship and that we revisited the contract that we entered into in 2013. And it's been a very active market. And since then, we've had not only the various changes that we've talked about in the industry, but WBA really coming to existence as a complete company. And we have with that Alex a strong leader in the U.S. retail that has a vision for what can be accomplished between AmerisourceBergen and WBA as partners. So we are optimistic about the strong growth for WBA. And we're optimistic about the partnership. And I think I've said everything that there is to say about this. And we know that WBA is a 50% shareholder and we expect that we'll carry on looking for ways to grow the marketplace together. And these are discussions that are literally ongoing every day or every week.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Yes. We go to David Francis with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, Steve and Tim. Good morning. Moving over to Kaiser, you clearly expect to keep those guys in the family here. Can you remind us to what degree, if any, the terms of that contract have been renegotiated since you originally got into the most recent term of that so we can get a sense as to what kind of terms might be renegotiated here as you get that contract recut? And also looking at Humana, given their transaction situation, if there's any update on that contract situation as well. Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Dave. It's Tim. So your question about Kaiser, I mean, I think we've communicated in the past, we have that business through June 30. So we will have one quarter impact this year, 2016, and also into 2017. We've put a reasonable assumption into our numbers this year and next year in terms of what it's going to take to renew that and that's been fairly consistent. We're heavily engaged with them. We're in discussions with them and we're optimistic that we'll get to the finish line with that important customer. Humana, I mean they're involved in a transaction right now; so we have that business for a while. I think I would say that our assumption for 2017 is that what we factored in is that we have that.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","All right. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Yes. We go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to go back and just clarify. I think you were talking about \u2013 so we're looking for our free cash flow to come back once you get out to fiscal 2018 with the new extension here in the investments with the Walgreens relationship. So if we're carrying high inventories, does that mean our payable terms are changing as well out in the future so that our working capital benefits that we've experienced historically are preserved? Or are those kind of permanently changed? I just wanted to clarify that point. Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Charles. It's Tim. I think I understand your question. I mean we talked about making working capital investments in both years and talked about inventory and other working capital being phased in 2016 and 2017, more of an impact in 2017. And there are no contemplated term changes to our manufacturers. We're always monitoring those and negotiating with the manufacturers, but those are the only changes that we've called out and we expect our free cash flow to be back much better, as Steve mentioned, over \u2013 125% or better of our adjusted net income in 2018 and beyond, which is still pretty healthy.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go to David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. For the reset expectations for 2H of fiscal 2016, how much of that is coming from generic deflation? And how much of that is coming from renewals? Is it really 50-50? And those are the two pieces that have caused the reset and expectations?","Tim G. Guttman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Dave, I'll jump in. I'm looking at Steve; so I'll jump in. Our reset for the second half of 2016 we called out the two items, one clearly was the contribution from generics being lower, the higher deflation rate than we anticipated and also the launches not contributing as much. I would say that's a big part of the reset. And then we also called out our plan to grow our independent generics. Those are the two reasons for the reset. We put them in that order. The environmental first, carrying more weight; so I would say it's easily two-thirds, one-third.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Lori, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","All right. That will be from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. So going back to Garen's question and I think you answered it, Steve, but on the pro-gen side, you had mentioned that kind of being one-third of the reason for the revised guidance. And I think you'd mentioned that volumes kind of seem okay. It's more about pricing, but there's not any evidence that you guys have lost some share in the independent pharmacy side, right?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks for the question. Now we did lose a buying group customer last year and that's really what we made some changes and we asked Dave Neu to come in and take over our GNP program which he's done a great job of and we recently announced a new leader there. Dave has really put in a new level of services around especially network and network contracting which is a lot like the membership base that GNP was looking for.","So we feel good about where we are. It's just that so much of the independent business is with buying groups now. And it just doesn't \u2013 you can't quite get as much progress as quickly as we would have anticipated. So that's really what we're talking about. We have wonderful confidence in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy offering. And we think it's a really important offering and with pro-gen for the independent base and we'll help them be successful in the future. And I think that the company's \u2013 the GNP base really appreciates it. So we have our trade show in Vegas in July and we already have record registrations and tremendous interest. So we feel good about what AmerisourceBergen is doing for independent pharmacy and certainly will intend to carry on investing in that area. So thanks for your time and Barbara, that will be the last question.","Barbara A. Brungess - Vice President-Corporate & Investor Relations","Yes. Did you have some closing comments?","Steven H. Collis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I just wanted to close by thanking you for your attention. We've actually gone to almost 70 minutes here. And I hope that you understand that we are severely disappointed about talking about taking our guidance down for 2016 and for 2017. But we do take the responsibility we have to all of you to provide you with timely, fair and balanced information very seriously. And it was with this intention that we planned for and delivered this conference call today.","I just hope you all take heart from this call that we have tremendous confidence in the services and the offering of AmerisourceBergen and the people of AmerisourceBergen and we remain resolute that AmerisourceBergen will be the company where knowledge, reach and partnership would shape healthcare delivery in the short and medium, but especially in the long term.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's Earnings Conference Call covering our fiscal 2002 -- 2012 third quarter results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen's President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO. During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again overcame a challenging year-over-year comparison and delivered solid quarterly results. In the June quarter, our revenues were down 2% to $19.8 billion, but our GAAP earnings per share were up 8% to $0.71. We made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions including World Courier, which closed in early May. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility, and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. Through 9 months, we are well positioned to meet objectives for the full year.","Our diverse revenue base continues to position us well to benefit from organic growth across the entire spectrum of pharmaceutical care, and our customer mix helps drive benefits from the historic influx of generics. Even as generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry, IMS Health's compounded annual sales growth in the U.S. in the range of 1% to 4%, and 4% to 6% worldwide through 2016. In addition, continued scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the U.S. Federal government and commercial payers demand continues improvement in efficiency, productivity and effectiveness across all aspects of health care.","One of the hallmarks of the U.S. market in particular is the quality of the relationship wholesalers have with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Over the last several years, AmerisourceBergen has significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to put an emphasis on looking for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel in order to help manufacturers meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. This is the strategic rationale for the material acquisitions we have made in the past 12 months. As we sit here today, we believe that both the TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions have significantly enhanced our spectrum of services at the supply channel. Moreover, they have brought a cadre of valuable new customers, employees and capabilities, which have exceeded our pre-closing expectations.","As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients and new challenges such as accountable care organization, they also increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our provider customers deliver world-class patient care on navigating a complex wave of reimbursement. And we believe they deserve fair compensation for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen continues to be an active participant in policy discussions in Washington with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system.","AmerisourceBergen associates remain focused on meeting objectives for the year both in terms of our financial performance and in delivering outstanding service to our customers. I take great pride in the enthusiasm and dedication of our team, and I'm honored to work beside them everyday. They meet challenges with creativity and determination, and they tirelessly seek new ways to meet the needs of the diverse markets we serve through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency.","As we noted in our press release, we believe it was prudent to separate our manufacture services business from pharmaceutical distribution for financial reporting purposes. We believe that disclosing this additional level of detail will increase investor understanding of our business and further improve the overall transparency of our financial reporting. Tim will cover the financials for the 2 segments, and I will now cover some of the key trends in our business units during the quarter.","AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation revenue declined 5% due in large part to a decline in sales to our largest customer, as well as the previously reported loss of a large retail customer beginning last September. In addition, we anniversaried last year's addition of a new alternate site customer in May, and top line growth continues to be mitigated by the impact of generic conversions. Year-to-date, the drug company revenues are only down slightly as anticipated. Over the course of the year, the wave of generic launches has progressed as planned and the Drug Company saw significant gross margin expansion in the quarter even as the 2 largest generics of Zyprexa and Lipitor came off exclusivity. We look forward to a few more launches still to come in our fourth quarter.","Back in June, we held our annual trade show for our independent retail customers and we continued to be impressed with their resilience and their ingenuity in providing personalized patient care in the committee -- community they serve. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members participate actively in the largest independent network of community pharmacies in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen and our independent customers strongly believe that they play a critical role in health care throughout the country by offering a compelling value proposition to patients and payers alike. ABDC is focused on ensuring that our network, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, remains dynamic by continuous investment in programs and services to meet the challenges of community pharmacy today and in the future. The implementation of our SAP platform continues on schedule with 14 distribution center conversions complete, representing over half of our distribution centers and 2\/3 of our revenues. We've made excellent progress and we expect additional conversions occurring in our fourth quarter and the remainder planned through the beginning of fiscal year 2013.","We also continue to strengthen our Canadian operations in support of previously reported new business wins in that market. We are confident that these and other investments will meaningfully increase the value we bring to all of our customers in the U.S. and Canada.","As we noted in the press release, we continue to participate in negotiations for the distribution contract to serve the newly combined business of Express Scripts and the former Medco. We believe we are nearing the end of the process, and while we don't have a firm date for an announcement, we do hope that the decision will be made within the next few weeks. We continue to be optimistic about our chances to win the business. However, it is a competitive process and we believe Express Scripts will ultimately choose a partner that they believe provides the best overall value.","AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 8%, driven by another particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our Oncology business performed well, while facing another very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Specialty generic products in the June quarter last year. The comparison will ease in the September quarter as Oxaliplatin returns to the market. ABSG continues to benefit from the launch of a branded ophthalmology product earlier this year, continuing to help establish significant market share for the manufacturers. Our experience with their product demonstrates the potent value of our Specialty franchise. While our undisputed strength in Specialty is Oncology business, we have expanded those capabilities to become an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. As I previously discussed, we now have a keen interest going forward in further expanding those capabilities into select global markets. The acquisition of World Courier has given us not only a premium quality clinical trial logistics services provider, but also an international framework upon which to further capitalize on our strengths by driving our specialty logistics, consulting, commercialization and reimbursement services into other geographic markets. The integration of World Courier is going very well and we are very excited about the new insights and opportunities that are being discovered as we bring these 2 great organizations together and gain operational exposure to international markets.","Our Consulting Services group continues to have a strong year as demand for commercialization, reimbursement and patient support services continues to be robust. We believe these combined service offerings distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace, provide unmatched value to manufacturers and will be an important driver of our growth going forward. As manufacturers seek to bring new products to market or expand sales of existing products in a challenging health care environment, we believe that demand for these services will only increase.","In terms of financial performance, the Consulting Services group delivered a solid quarter while making excellent progress in the further integration of TheraCom, which is performing well. Even setting aside the contribution from TheraCom, the Lash Group alone had outstanding results. As Tim will detail, the solid performance across our business contributed to excellent cash flow in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our capital in order to increase shareholder value, including searching for acquisitions that meet the criteria we have in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers, both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and specialty distribution and services, as well as consulting services. We also remain committed to returning a minimum of 30% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a hurdle that we have handily exceeded over the last several years.","Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first 9 months of our fiscal year put us well on our way to meeting our objectives for the full fiscal year. As we said in our press release, we have narrowed the range of our diluted EPS expectations for the full year to $2.80 to $2.84. Tim will provide the details on our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that as a result of that tremendous financial flexibility, we have repurchased $540 million of our shares in the year when we spent over $800 million on acquisitions, and we'll pay down about $400 million in debt in September. This speaks to the enormous strength and resilience of our business in a year of significant change for AmerisourceBergen, and indeed for the health care industry more broadly, as well as the quality of our financial planning and financial stewardship.","As you know, we are deeply engaged in our business planning process for our fiscal 2013, and we do not yet know the future status of the business we do with our largest customer. As we noted in our press release, however, we do expect that new generic launches in both ABDC and ABSG, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions and other favorable items will help drive earnings growth next fiscal year. The impact of customer consolidation and competitive market dynamics on our margins is expected to offset some of that growth. As our provider customers across the health landscape prepare for the full implementation of the federal government's health care reform initiatives, we are being challenged to help find new ways to reduce costs. Across the industry, big customers are getting bigger, whether they are mail order pharmacies, acute care networks or independents seeking greater strength in number through joining buying groups. Over the long term, this should lead to an even more stable and resilient industry. Of course, we will continue to manage our own expenses and working capital. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet affords us additional opportunities to drive shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With all that in mind, our preliminary expectation is for high single digits to low double-digit diluted EPS growth in fiscal 2013.","Over the last year, we made important investments in our business with an eye to the future while we continued to focus on helping our customers and ourselves take advantage of the unprecedented growth in generics and the many opportunities in Specialty. Demand is strong and growing for the core products we distribute, and we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the distribution of life-improving and life-saving therapies. Our manufacture services businesses help ensure products get to market as efficiently as possible and that patients have access to both traditional medications and the most innovative and complex products. As cost-containment efforts mount across the health care spectrum, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. I take great pride in the energy and creativity our associates bring to our business. Each day, I see the results of their innovative thinking and their dedication to exceeding customer expectations, and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you just heard, ABC delivered a solid quarter and through 9 months, our performance is tracking well to our financial targets. The key highlight this quarter was our ability to overcome the oncology generic headwind we've mentioned in the past. Going into this fiscal year, we knew that Q3 would be our toughest EPS comparison. We consistently called out a $0.33 headwind this year from Specialty generics. Of this headwind, we anticipated about half of the $0.33 would negatively impact the third quarter. We're pleased that we are able to successfully overcome this Q3 headwind and show solid EPS growth.","Two other highlights for the quarter. We continued our discipline in terms of managing expenses across the organization and we integrated World Courier into ABC reporting. Our results include 2 months of their operations.","Before I start with the quarterly financial details, let me highlight that in our press release, we expanded our disclosures to include detail for 2 reporting segments in addition to our ABC consolidated results. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes our Drug and Specialty Group operating segments. The Other segment includes our manufacturer and services businesses, which consists of the Consulting and World Courier operating segments. Upon review of the financial reporting requirements, we determined that there was a need to separate drug distribution and manufacturer services due to the nature of their business operations and different revenue growth rates and operating margins. The disclosure of our 2 reporting segments will improve investor transparency going forward.","Now back to the quarterly details. I'll cover ABC consolidated results first. Starting with the top line, revenues were $19.8 billion, a 1 .9% decrease over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5%, offset by higher Specialty revenues of nearly 8%. We also had the benefit in our June '12 revenues from 2 of our acquisitions, TheraCom and World Courier. They contributed a combined $300 million of new revenues in the current quarter.","Moving along, gross profit was $689 million in the quarter, up 5.4% from last June with a gross margin of 3.49%. Just to remind everyone, World Courier is included in our financial results and they have a fairly high gross profit margin due to their best-in-class service model. World Courier and our other acquisitions contributed nearly $60 million to our gross profit in the current quarter.","Our LIFO charge was $4.7 million in the quarter, down $6.7 million from last year. We expect a LIFO charge of between $12 million and $15 million for the full year, down significantly from last year. Finally, the generic benefit we received in the current June quarter from new generic launches and price appreciation was in line with our expectations. Let's move to operating expenses.","This quarter, operating expenses were $375 million, up 11.6%. But this amount includes approximately $50 million of operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions, as well as approximately $5 million of non-recurring charges related to the World Courier transaction. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our operating expenses would have decreased about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Our businesses continue to do an excellent job at managing their expenses.","Operating income of $314 million in the quarter decreased about 1%, while operating margin was up by 2 basis points compared to last June. Our third quarter was slowed by the World Courier transaction cost, and more importantly, the difficult comparison versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating income line and other income, we had income of $4.8 million primarily related to an increase in evaluation of a note that was due to ABC from the October 2008 sale of our prior PMSI business. Interest expense of approximately $25 million in the June quarter increased 33% compared to last year as a result of our $500 million senior notes that we issued back in November. Our effective income tax rate of 38.3% was slightly higher than last year's 38.2% and is in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.71 increased by $0.05 or just under 8% over the last quarter -- over the same quarter last year. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately $256 million, down just over 8% from last June. At June 30, 2012, we had 251 million outstanding shares.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the June quarter. Starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution, total revenues were $19.4 billion, down about 3.3% over last year's quarter. Drug Company revenues were down about 5% due primarily to lower sales with former Medco and the impact from the loss of a large chain customer last year , the  former Longs Drugs. Slightly over half of the decline came from lower sales to former Medco, driven by generic conversions and changes in their book of business. Without these 2 negative impacts, our Drug business would have had growth of 2%. Also during the quarter, the Drug Company anniversaried a large customer win from the prior June quarter.","Specialty Group's revenues increased nearly 8%, led by strong performance in 2 of its businesses with growth significantly above market rates, ICS, our third party logistics business, and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business. From a segment standpoint, gross profit decreased about $25 million and our gross profit margins slipped somewhat. Most of the dollar decrease is due to the oncology generics headwind, a high-margin contributor last June quarter, offset by the contribution from generic Lipitor and Zyprexa, both of which had their exclusivity periods end during the June '12 quarter. We did have other generic launches during the quarter and also gross profit contributions from our specialty businesses. These positives were offset by the decrease in our revenues and margin pressure. It should be noted that Drug Company as viewed on its own, had gross profit margin expansion of 20 basis points in the June 2012 quarter. This segment managed operating expenses very effectively, especially payroll and benefit expenses, as well as external consulting expenses, which enabled us to offset some of the gross profit dollars we lost with the oncology generic headwind. Overall, we're very pleased with the operating results for this segment.","Moving to the Other reporting segment which again is Consulting, which includes our Packaging business and World Courier. As mentioned previously, our 2 large acquisitions accounted for nearly $300 million of new revenues in the third quarter. World Courier revenues are tracking well against our expectations, which we provided back in our press release that announced the acquisition. Operating income from the Other segment increased $11 million from last year's quarter. Of this increase, about $8 million is related to our fiscal '12 acquisitions. The remaining increase is related to our legacy businesses. I'd like to highlight that our non-recurring charge of about $5 million is not included in our segment level reporting. For the June quarter, the impact of our World Courier acquisition was essentially breakeven due to the transaction costs.","Now let's turn to our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be favorable. We generated $92 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 9 month's total to $760 million. Our businesses continue to focus on working capital. In fact, our cash conversion cycle, based on a rolling 4-quarter average, improved by 1 day to 1.7 days based in the current June quarter, from 2.7 days in the June 2011 quarter.","Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter and $128 million for the 9 months. For the full year, we are still tracking to our guidance for CapEx of $200 million. During the quarter, we bought back $186 million of our shares. For the 9 months, we purchased $514 million of shares and this slightly exceeds our March quarter guidance of $500 million. At June 30, we have $744 million left on our May 2012 share repurchase authorization.","Our cash balance at June 30 was $1.7 billion. As we've discussed in the past, we need approximately $500 million in available cash to account for swings in working capital and to run the business. As a reminder, in mid-September, we will be using cash to retire our $400 million 5 5\/8% senior notes.","Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We now expect our GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84. This includes an estimated $20 million of non-recurring costs related primarily to transaction and severance expenses. With narrowing our EPS range, this means that we will have EPS growth of 10% to 12% this year after absorbing the $0.05 negative impact from non-recurring charges.","Revenue. We continue to expect revenue growth to be flat or up modestly for the full year. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high single digits. As previously communicated, Q4 is our easiest operating income comparable for the year. Because of this, we expect most of our operating margin expansion to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is still tracking to finish in the $800 million to $900 million range.","Looking ahead. We are deeply engaged in our business planning process for fiscal 2013, and there are still many moving parts including, of course, the Express Scripts RFP. As Steve outlined, as large customers consolidate, they are seeking better pricing which includes generic pricing. And as recent contract discussions have demonstrated, our customers want us to be part of the solution in helping them meet the economic demands of the new health care landscape. Our high single digit to low double-digit EPS growth range is based on assumptions on several moving parts, and includes possible outcomes on the Express Scripts contract. Our EPS range is preliminary and we still have quite a bit of work to complete in our planning process, but it does incorporate the best information we have right now. So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 9 months into our fiscal year, we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal '12 and we are hard at work on our fiscal '13 plan. Here is Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mary.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question was, on some of the commentary that you had in the press release, and I think you echoed it a bit on your prepared remarks where you sort of talked about competitive pricing pressures and sort of the competitive landscape, can you expand a little bit on what you mean there? Is it sort of something that we always see as a persistent part in the business or are there really new dynamics that you're referring to?","Steven H. Collis","No. I think -- thanks for the question, Tom. What we're seeing is that the larger customers are getting larger, and we've always said that the larger customers get the biggest -- the best deal and we're seeing some of that. I think in addition, we've got much more generics as a percentage of sales. Don't forget, we have a very diverse customer base, almost all of them buy generics from us. So generics as a percentage of overall portfolio have increased. So I think we just -- people are looking at their businesses and their potential financial impacts from health care reform and reimbursement pressure, and we -- they're expecting us to participate with them in a much tougher future. So a tougher future where we all have to be more efficient, and I think we're just not immune from some of that. So those are the trends that I'd point out.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify your comments on guidance, I guess just to ask specifically, it sounds like it's early, maybe there;s some conservatism because there are so many moving parts. On Express specifically, we all know that's a pretty big moving parts. Would you be able to meet this guidance range if tomorrow you found out you didn't retain the Medco, the legacy Medco business?","Tim G. Guttman","Hey, Tom, this is Tim, and I'll answer your question this way. I mean our guidance includes, like you said, different assumptions on moving parts, one of which is Express Scripts, and it contemplates both scenarios, winning it and losing it. Again, it's Express Scripts and other factors looking out over the next years.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just my question is elaboration on comps around next year. So -- and I appreciate providing some clarity here with, perhaps, a tone of trying to be prudent here. But I guess, Steve, if we think about a scenario where your largest customer, Express, chooses not to continue to do business with you or splits the business, can you remind us of some of the factors that you would, could, go through to help mitigate some of those lost revenues from the cost side that would keep you still in the range of guidance? And along with that, is there -- could there be a situation where they might be a quarter or 2 of timing mismatch between revenues and costs that could cause you to vary around your guidance ranges?","Steven H. Collis","Thanks for the question. We really are deep in this. In fact, we're going -- the team's going out to visit all our drug regions next weak, which really is the start for us in detail, in the detailed planning process. But we had information that -- we have information that we think is material that want -- that we felt was incumbent on us to share with all of you, and that's the way AmerisourceBergen is run. And we're proud of that. We're not backing off that. So absolutely, if we lose Express Scripts, don't forget our current business is -- really a lot of the greenfield that we set up during the merge is really set up to handle big mail order business that we've done with Medco traditionally for as long as I can remember. I've been with the company 8.5 years. We've always had the count. But it's very little expense. In fact, many of the characteristics of this business are what we used to call dock to dock business and of course, you remember that very well. So there's not too much expense there. And coincidently, a lot of the facilities that we service in Medco are our most highly efficient modern facilities, but we would -- we absolutely have opportunities to cut down our cost. And like Tim said, this current thinking, while it's early, really contemplates all the way from us entirely losing this business to winning it, including winning the part that we currently do not service, based on our basic understanding what the economics can be. But it honestly is early.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate the reflection there. And I guess my follow-up is around your LIFO charge. So, Tim, you're communicating a reduction in your range of LIFO expectations versus what you had suggested back in April by, say, a couple of million dollars. I know at the time you had said you anticipated big impact relative last year with the generic introductions and some moderation in brand price inflation. What's causing you to further moderate your views on that inflation-based cost? And as you think about your guidance for next year, can you give us any sense of general ranges of LIFO charges you're anticipating for fiscal '13?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, Larry, it's probably a little bit early to talk about LIFO for '13. I mean, we're still looking through that. In terms of LIFO for the June quarter, at the end of the June quarter, we saw a pretty good brand pricing, increased percentages for our top 75 brand drugs, a little bit off from last year. So I mean there is some moderation there in terms of brand pricing. And we're seeing a little bit steeper generic deflation especially with generic Lipitor and Zyprexa. So that's driving the change, the slight change in our full year LIFO forecast. But again, for next year, we're probably -- it just depends on where brand price inflation is. It's a little bit early.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to go back, I know you touched on some of the changing market industry dynamics and specifically, Tim mentioned the generic pricing. I was just wondering maybe for perspective, if you could share your thoughts or recent trends on both the buy side margin that you've seen recently and then maybe separate out the sell side margin just to give us some perspective on your dealings on both with the manufacturer and the customer.","Steven H. Collis","Many times -- I'll just talk about the buy side first. Many times on the fee-for-service agreements, we're really in our third generation and we've dealt with a lot of pharma consolidation, and we feel that we've -- the industry on the manufacturer side really understands the value we represent and there's no significant erosion there or anything at all. Obviously, the generic mix at AmerisourceBergen has opportunities to sell generics to almost all of our customers. As you know, we believe we have the most diverse customer base. It has really been driven by this generic wave, and we have set out our whole portfolio in both Drug and Specialty to really recognize the strength in generics. I hope you would have buy [indiscernible] someday and really capitalize on the opportunity that we have for generics and specialty. The sell side, I think, the biggest things we can point to is somewhat of an anxiety of compressed reimbursement and just a lot of consolidation. I mean, just read the headlines. It's not just that particular one that's on everyone's mind. It's -- there's just a lot of consolidation. We have community oncologists, for example, that are constantly getting a lot bigger, and our bigger customers get a better deal. We have independent customers joining buying groups. So these are the biggest trends that I can point to. And we -- I think also there's a lot of marquee customers up for bid. It's been pretty well-publicized. VA process, definitely the SR process has really kicked up some dust, I could say, from other customers. So those -- without being too specific, and we don't like to comment on individual contracts, we have been in this business a long time. We understand how to contract with customers, and we believe that our best bet is to maintain our key customers and customers that we believe are going to represent us growth in the years ahead.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And just maybe around the preliminary guidance, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the major swing factors. Obviously, I think, we all are well aware of the Express contract, but maybe just how you're thinking about other important contracts. I know you don't want to name names, but I think PharMerica is one that's out there. And then just some of the other major contributing factors, what's the assumption around buyback. It looks like there's obviously some nice contribution from lower interest expense and clearly, World Courier next year. Maybe just some of the pushes and pulls around the guidance range would be helpful.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, this is Tim. In terms of the guidance, I mean, we're not going to talk specifically about other contracts. Certainly, we made an assumption about Express in there. And as we start the plan process, we always look out over the 12-month horizon of what other contracts we may renew and renegotiate. So there's an assumption in there about other contracts. And some of the other things, too, would be Oxaliplatin and an assumption about how that's going to perform next year. I mean that's a big unknown. We don't know how the pricing will stick in the market, how many suppliers, and so that's a factor. Certainly, we make an assumption about expenses. And finally, in terms of share repurchases, the assumption is, I think if you look back to what we've done historically, the last 2 or 3 years, we've been around about the $500 million range, so that's probably a pretty safe number to be in at for the -- that's our thinking.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to follow up on generics. And I'm not sure exactly how you're thinking about this with respect to your guidance, but, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, right? You went into fiscal '12 with a $0.33 hole. Obviously, everyone's focused on this generic calendar. And so as you think about your guidance for fiscal '13, could give us a sense for maybe what the contribution you're expecting in '13 versus '12, what that looks like?","Tim G. Guttman","Glen, I mean, we're just, again, we're early in the plan process. We don't want to get into specifics. I mean we do have generics, a couple of good ones that launched at the end of our Q4 that carry over into fiscal '13 that will definitely help us. We're encouraged, I mentioned before, Oxaliplatin will be back. We only have it for 6 weeks, we get it next year. There are some unknowns about that. But overall, it's -- you're not going to have a generic Lipitor and Zyprexa, but there are some good generics that helped us early in the year. But again, we're not ready to kind of dial in any specific EPS impact numbers.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. Maybe I could just ask Steve one follow-up question. Steve, I just want to talk about a comment you made with respect to acquisitions. You said, I think, the company is still receptive to the idea of acquisitions. And it sounds like you're pretty pleased with the progress at both TheraCom and World Courier Group. And as you think about where you are with respect to those integrations, I mean, you feel like the company could handle additional acquisitions in fiscal '13 or you kind of going to just see how it goes?","Steven H. Collis","Well, Glen, that's a great question. I do think that we are operationally well-situated. And I think actually, TheraCom is a very good example. I mean, we've had some work to do at the corporate office, yes, but obviously, we bought this from a well-run company and it was in good shape. And really, most of the integration work is carrying on in our Consulting Services business. So I think they're very well equipped to run that. And World Courier was definitely a different expansion for us. We've had a lot of work to do. I think Tim pointed out one of the highlights for this year was really getting World Courier into the financial reporting criteria for a public company and that's gone well, but we do think that one of the reasons we're investing in this company was the platform opportunity and now, when we go consider anything internationally, we have local intelligence, which is huge. Local understanding of tax laws, of who the good players are, who the bad players are. So we do think that this opens up some attractive markets to us, which we started out our release by talking about, obviously, the obvious fact that pharmaceutical growth in the rest of the world will be higher than the U.S. So we're not rushing in here. We don't think that there's any nirvana market or anything. But it is important to us to drive our Specialty and Consulting practices throughout the world, and we think we have leading practices in those areas and a lot of good intelligence and methodologies to share with the rest of the world.","Tim G. Guttman","Glen, this is Tim. I'll just say, after 100 days, we're really pleased with what we have so far, and they're performing right on our expectations. So, like I said, neutral in Q3, and we expect them to contribute $0.01 or $0.02 in 4. So again, very encouraged this year and looking forward to what they're going to do in '13.","Operator","Our next question goes to the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tim, what's left on deal expenses? Will we see much going forward in the numbers? And I think you hinted at it, but what was the actual dilution from new generics year-over-year to revenues?","Tim G. Guttman","The actual dilution -- in terms of revenues?","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, in terms of revenue growth rate.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, we -- what we said in terms of the Medco, I mean Medco was down probably about half. I mean, it's probably in the $500 million or $600 million range, that's from our largest customer, Medco by itself. And again, not all that is -- some of that is book of business, right, and some of it is the generic conversions. In terms of your other question, I would say, Robert, that we don't have much left in terms of World Courier. I mean I think we're at $17 million in terms of non-recurring costs through Q3. In my comments I said I thought we'd end up about $20 million. We probably still have some other non-recurring charges that will come through, about $3 million, not related to World Courier in Q4.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, I'm going to ask 2 if it's all right. Regardless of correlation or causation in the past, we have seen some rather funky behavior from the manufacturers around major U.S. elections. I'm specifically thinking about the September quarter of 2004, where price inflation contracted fairly dramatically. Have you considered the possibility of that hitting into this election or do you think it's really not in the limelight here? I guess any signal on pharma behavior on pricing here in the near term. And then I have a follow-up.","Steven H. Collis","The pharma pricing has been a little bit less than last year, the price increases, but still very robust. And as I said, we're spending more time internationally and everyone's very envious of an environment where we can have price increases. So it's an excellent thought, Eric. I credit to you for thinking of that. We'll pay it more attention, but we haven't really seen anything concerning. I think more of the price increases have to do with patent expirations, is what we're seeing a trend there, some price increases and pricing strategies ahead of large patent expirations. But as you know, we've got some significant launches in this quarter and less exciting year in brand to generic conversion next year, but still very robust. And we will see some impact on brand prices from those.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And my follow-up is related to business transformation, the ASP program. You seem to continue to be ahead of schedule and doing great there. Just curious if you could give us an update on the incremental benefits to OpEx compared to your original thoughts for the implementation, and then whether you might be looking to fiscal '13 and '14 and thinking that there could be some additional juice on that $10 million and $40 million of OpEx savings that you had previously talked about.","Steven H. Collis","Yes, I'll let Tim mainly handle this, but I'll just say that generally, we spend -- we've done most of our capital spend, then now, it's really operational spend. So the depreciation is starting to hit us financially. The consulting expenses, the external consulting is definitely an opportunity we've had to reduce cost. And we've actually done well against our plan for our BT budget for this year, but I'll let Tim give you some color on this.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, thanks, Steve. Yes, Eric, actually, to Steve's point, I mean I just want to make sure I stress this. I mean, we're starting to see a little bit of expense savings now. Again, when I mention external consulting, a chunk of that is from our IT department and the fact that we're moving along and deploying SAP really efficiently and effectively. So we're seeing a little bit now, but we're still -- we're not -- we're still believing that the $10 million's appropriate. That's one of those when we talked about moving parts in our range, that's one of the assumptions kind of factored in to our range for '13, and we're still on the $40 million for '14. So at this point, we're just not ready to commit any upside or juice as you called out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to follow up on a comment that you made around the Express Scripts new contract. You said it would be the best overall value. I'm just wondering if there's any changes to the types of services that they're looking for versus what you previously provided for Medco? And then just on the follow-up side for that, I think I read in a Philadelphia paper some comments around specialty and your growth in specialty and perhaps, moving more towards the patient. I was wondering if maybe you could just also comment on that, as well as potentially competing with a customer like the PBM.","Steven H. Collis","Let me just talk about that. I think our business in specialty is -- and we're talking about this with a customer the other day that everyone has a different definition of specialty. When AmerisourceBergen says specialty, we're really talking about physician administrative products and related services to manufacturers. I think when a PBM says specialty, it usually means patient self-administrative products. And so I think that, that's pretty well defined. And we actually think that there's a lot of opportunities to collaborate in those areas including with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network and there's an opportunity to do potentially more specialty in the community. And we do take our specialty franchise and expertise very seriously there, and think that we afford a lot of AmerisourceBergen customers that are interested in this area, an opportunity to gain from our expertise, including in the policy area and the manufacturer relations area. The first part of your question had to do with Express Scripts and the overall value we provide. I think that was more of a comment that the economic deals. I mean, there's a very few companies that are qualified to be the provider to Express Scripts so it's a small universe. And I think economics is part of it, experience is part of it. And I don't think, honestly, that any of the qualifications have really materially changed since the start of this process, which has been pretty quick if you think about it compared to some of the other ones that we've seen in the recent past.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just so I understand that, Steve, though, so your comments around commercialization of a product and perhaps, working in partnership with a PBM, you don't view that as an opportunity with a new potential contract with the new Express Scripts or is that a future opportunity, but not part of this RFP process?","Steven H. Collis","No, we see -- I think quite the opposite. I said I think that our market presences and our market expertises are very complimentary. But the focus on this has really been on the core economics, and I think our idea is obviously to win an account and then we can work on an alignment and future opportunities together. So that's really what our strategy is there.","Operator","The next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of things, just drilling down to your assumption for next year. Oxaliplatin comes back, Express, is that -- could be a mover for you?","Steven H. Collis","We are obviously excited to have Oxaliplatin back and at the end of May, we were thrilled that the comp is out now. We enjoyed the ride, but it was good timing to have the comp out. And August, we're going to have the product back, but it's going to be very different. The ASP's pretty high so that's a positive, but there's no at risk, there's no exclusivity period, so we're going to have several manufacturers and we think that the pricing will be very dynamic. It's probably going to be more akin to, again, the specialty drugs and they're different than all the solids. The prices never get quite as low, but it's going to be more akin to the expiry of 180-day exclusivity period than it is to a new generic injectable launch is what I'd say. So while we're expecting with our market share that we have and the expertise we have in oncology, we expect them to do very well here as we did with docetaxel and gemcitabine. We don't expect that you're going to be hearing half of our earnings call be devoted to Oxaliplatin in the future.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The said question, if you just look at the totality of your -- for all generics, the contribution that you think you'll get next year compared to the contribution [indiscernible], and my specific view is, I think, from all accounts, Lipitor was just off the charts [indiscernible] during the exclusivity period. Obviously, you're losing that. And we were just having more troubles still at the calendar and thinking is it going to better, worse, the same next [indiscernible]?","Steven H. Collis","Yes, I don't think it's going to be quite as robust, but, Tim, you...","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, John, you were breaking up a little bit, but I think what you're asking is what next year looks like. And again, we have a little bit of a benefit from our fiscal year with a couple of large generics launching at the end of our Q4. But overall, talking to our generics guys, I mean, we think it will be a good year. It's going to probably be a little down compared to this year. It's tough to replace generic Lipitor and Zyprexa. But again, there are a couple of other ones out there that we're encouraged about. So down a little bit, but not bad.","Steven H. Collis","And again, Lipitor, because of the class of customers we service here, who buys generics from us, might not have been as big for us as it was for the other players in the industry. Just keep that in mind.","Tim G. Guttman","And I guess I would like, again, going back to that, I mean let's go back and highlight Steve's comment earlier, is a lot of our volume is coming through larger customers on generics. So again, they get their pricing -- they bring us more volumes but they're pricing is a little bit more favorable.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just some quick follow-up questions here. So first of all, Steve, I think on your last comment around the volume, a lot of your generic volume coming from larger customers, so can you clarify that a little bit for us? Because when I think about AmerisourceBergen, I think, really, it's going to affect a big portion of your customer base being kind of like the smaller independents. So when you comment about the generic volumes, are you referring to kind of the PBM and the Omnicare of the word? Or is that -- or are you talking about comp like your Specialty segment? So if you can just clarify as to who those large customers are. And then secondly, from data that we've seen recently, it seems like that there have been some good generic price increases taking place. So how are you thinking of generic inflation in the context of your forward outlook?","Steven H. Collis","Well, 2011, we did very well on generic price inflation. It's been much more moderate this year. And I think we even pointed out the numbers because it was significant to the interpretation. We haven't seen anything as robust this year. Ricky, apologies for your last name, [indiscernible] but we do have, we believe, the most diverse customer base within our industry. And we are very proud of the strong independent business that we have. We're also doing more business within the health systems on generics, which is a great trend for us given our health systems presence. We also, as you know, we never used to talk about generics and specialty, we talk about a lot. So there are a lot of really good trends for us in generics. But another trend is obviously, our large PBM customer doesn't really buy any significant generics from us, which we've talked about a lot. And the larger customers, a lot of them say -- when we do -- during our last round of contract negotiations, they may have been buying 4% to 7% of their purchases were generics and now, it's a lot higher. And those customers are getting bigger. And we have to share more of the economics on generics with them because it's a much bigger part, they're much higher profile product category to them. So those are some of the trends that we've been pointing out. And you're absolutely correct to think of AmerisourceBergen as specialty customers and independent pharmacies and large health system presence and big ultimate start or closed-door pharmacy businesses, and that's definitely one of the strengths of us, is our diversity in our business that we serve.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So in that line, just another clarification, when you think about CapEx fiscal year '13 and when you say that it might be done a little in terms of generic contribution, you're really looking at a basket which includes a specialty generic and Oxaliplatin, as well as solid orals rather than separating the 2. Is that fair?","Steven H. Collis","The top line brand to generic conversions, and some of this fall -- it's complicated because some of it will have fourth quarter launches that would impact our fiscal year '13, but you know it was $13 billion in fiscal year '12, and it's about $11 billion to $12 billion in fiscal year '13. And again, the quarters move and we're early in our guidance and we're busy looking at it. But again, $11 billion is a very -- is a good year for us. It's -- if you look at our performance over the last 10 years, it's not -- it's a good year. So yes, we look forward to providing more guidance. We just wanted to give you a benefit of our early look at 2013 and what we know about some large contract negotiations that are going on. And I hope you appreciate the foresight that we've given you and the approach that we've taken, which is always being as transparent and as communicative with our investors as we can. So I think with that, we'll wrap up. Ricky, thanks for your questions. And, Barb, you want to make some comments?","Barbara A. Brungess","Do you have a...","Steven H. Collis","Okay, I have -- all right [indiscernible]  Okay. I'm up for the strong close. All right. So my strong close is that I recently completed my first full year as CEO of AmerisourceBergen, which I'm very proud to serve in this position. And I unequivocably and very confidently state that ABC's franchise and our place in the industry and our long-term prospects are really outstanding. We have just repeated -- we have just reported an excellent quarter and we are well on our way to completing a successful 2012. And I thank you for your attention today. I believe that ABC's making the right investments to secure our future and we look forward to seeing some of you in September at various conferences. And, of course, we'll have our full fiscal year '13 earnings in November. Thank you.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Steve. And just a couple of calendar items. We'll be at the Robert W. Baird Health Care Conference in New York on September 5 and at the Morgan Stanley Conferences also in New York on September 11. So that concludes our call for today.

Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox. Please go ahead.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results. I am Keri Mattox, Vice President, Corporate Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen; and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","On today's call, we also will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in today's press release as well as on our website.","During this conference call, we will also make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.","What that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone. Today, I am pleased to discuss our second quarter results. I'll also touch on the current market landscape, our continued focus on execution across our business and our expectations for the rest of this fiscal year.","To start, revenues were up 10.5% to $41 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.94 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.6% compared to the previous fiscal year period.","Importantly, our core Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses are continuing to execute extremely well and are outperforming our initial expectations for the year. We are proud of this continued solid execution, and I want to take a moment to again thank our amazing team of 21,000 associates for their dedication and performance.","It is our team around the globe that really helps shape our culture, power our transformation and drive our growth. In fact, we were recently named again in the top workplace by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philly.com. This is our sixth consecutive year on the list and another indicator of our strong team and positive corporate culture. So, again, thank you.","One former team member in particular also bears mentioning. Please join me and the AmerisourceBergen team as we wish the best to our colleague, Peyton Howell, in her new role. We take great pride in developing our team and having the strongest talent in the industry. Peyton is an example of an executive that honed her skills here at AmerisourceBergen and developed and built a fantastic team to succeed her. I've worked with Peyton at AmerisourceBergen for two decades, and I know she will continue to do great work in the healthcare industry.","Moving on, my comments today will be focused primarily on two topics. One, the current market landscape; and two, AmerisourceBergen's continued execution both in addressing challenges and also in maximizing opportunities. So, first, let's talk about the current market landscape.","Overall, we're continuing to see a stable but competitive market. Our recent conversations with customers around contract renewals and RFPs indicate that customers recognize the value AmerisourceBergen brings, as we help them manage their day-to-day operations, navigate the reimbursement landscape and ultimately grow their business.","As you know, generic deflation has been higher than historic norms for several quarters, creating a headwind for us and our business. That deflation rate, however, continues to be stable. We continue to see it tracking in the high-single digits in Q2, in line with our expectations.","Brand inflation is also tracking in line with our projections. We have no major contract renewals on the horizon, and we're continuing to make strong progress on our customer contract rebalancing efforts. All of these factors drive the market and competitive stability we're currently seeing across our industry.","The U.S. healthcare system continues to evolve, with several proposed deals announced recently, marking moves by some players towards consolidation. We feel that AmerisourceBergen is strongly positioned in this environment and that industry consolidation actually underscores the strength of our business strategy.","Let me explain. Distributors offer our industry the highest level of efficiency and significant value for our services, and AmerisourceBergen is further increasing that efficiency and value-add through our strategic internal investments. Our businesses like World Courier, Lash, Xcenda, ION help facilitate, broaden, and ensure patient access as pharmaceutical companies continue to innovate, develop and launch new life-changing medicines.","Additionally, AmerisourceBergen is helping our strategic partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as our independent pharmacy customers as they continue to establish the pharmacy as the hub of healthcare in the U.S. market.","Walgreens has successfully on-boarded over 1,900 acquired Rite Aid stores, and we have seamlessly integrated them into our Pharmaceutical Distribution network. This is a great example of how we can add significant value for our larger, complex customers. We help them to scale, compete and pursue and achieve their strategic goals.","And across our independent pharmacy customer portfolio, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Network (sic) [Elevate Provider Network] pharmacies continue to run their businesses at the highest levels, outpacing the growth of their non-GNP and Elevate peers. These pharmacies are strengthened by AmerisourceBergen services and solutions, and are serving as a critical resource to patients as they care for themselves, their families and their loved ones.","In short, we see the current market environment and the future market landscape as a growth driver for AmerisourceBergen. Our customers are fast-growing, both organically and through strategic M&A, and are evolving to continue to meet patient needs and compete in a dynamic healthcare system.","AmerisourceBergen is working with our manufacturer and provider customers to provide the services they need to successfully build their product pipelines, run their businesses and to ensure patient access to the highest quality healthcare products and treatments.","Second, let's talk about execution. I continue to be extremely proud about how AmerisourceBergen is successfully navigating the current market, rising to the challenges we face across our businesses and executing to maximize our opportunities for growth.","Let's take a few minutes to talk about some of the current challenges and opportunities the company is addressing.","First, challenges. Every company has them. How a company is able to execute to manage and overcome those challenges is the truest test of its ability to drive value for its partners, customers and shareholders. We are doing just that.","PharMEDium. We remain committed to enhancing PharMEDium's quality assurance and quality control programs and continuing to build its position as the industry's market, innovation and quality leader. That includes remediation efforts currently underway at our Memphis facility where we voluntarily suspended operations in December.","As a reminder, our three other compounding facilities have recently completed FDA inspections and have remained open. We are working diligently with full-time teams of both internal and external experts and communicating with the FDA to fully comply with agency regulations and new compounding quality priorities.","Our current expectation is that we will bring Memphis back online and operational this fiscal year, but likely now in a phased manner, meaning that we won't have the facility back to fully operational until fiscal 2019. While this is a longer timeline than we initially anticipated, completing the remediation in a way that ensures the very highest levels of quality and patient safety is always our top priority.","I'm happy to report that continued execution across other AmerisourceBergen distribution businesses is helping to significantly offset the impact of this updated PharMEDium timeline. The contribution from PharMEDium's Memphis facility has been essentially removed from our fiscal 2018 financial expectations, which Tim will talk about in more detail in just a few minutes.","But this business's value proposition remains compelling. PharMEDium has strong fundamentals, there is attractive growth potential and we feel we are the best positioned in the industry to execute over the long-term, meeting and growing market demand and delivering the highest quality and safest products to our customers.","Moving on to our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group, reported as Other. We're continuing to execute at Lash Group, launching the Fusion platform, which we believe is a game changer for the industry. The customer migration and on-boarding is in progress and customer feedback continues to be positive.","In fact, we just completed the on-boarding of our largest customer to-date with high levels of customer satisfaction. However, the slower than initially anticipated ramp remains a challenge and is having an impact on that business's pipeline as well as the overall segment. We are confident that we have the right team, technology and unrivaled expertise to execute and make this process a success.","I want to take a moment to talk about another challenge that we all face and that AmerisourceBergen is engaged and mobilized to address, the opioid epidemic. As you all know, AmerisourceBergen's role in the supply chain is one of a logistics provider and distributor. We are responsible for getting FDA-approved drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers to DEA and state registered pharmacies that dispense them based on prescriptions to our licensed healthcare providers.","We have no ability to encourage the prescribing or dispensing of pain medicines. We do not have access to patient information and are not qualified to interfere with the very personal clinical decisions made between patients and their physicians. And finally, AmerisourceBergen does not compensate our associates based on the sales of opioids.","Here are some things that AmerisourceBergen does do. We report daily to the DEA. For more than a decade, we've adhered to all monitoring requirements and provided daily reports of all controlled substances shipped to our customers, including opioid-based medication to the DEA. That includes every controlled substance shipments every day.","We stop suspicious orders. We use best-in-class algorithms and data analytic tools to identify orders of interest, and stop shipment on suspicious orders. In fact, while it is an understandably difficult process with a customer, it is necessary, and we stopped tens of thousands of suspicious order shipments over the last decade.","We partner. We are working with Walgreens and others on the safe medication disposal kiosks take-back program. We also work with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network to offer a safe drug disposal program.","We support. AmerisourceBergen Foundation works closely with other foundations and organizations to educate and drive programs to help address the crisis. For example, we are providing resources to municipalities throughout the country to help them drive the safe disposal of drugs in their communities.","We innovate. We work with Prevention Action Alliance and edify to offer a first of its kind digital drug abuse education curriculum for high school students. Additionally, we've recently joined together with leading partners across healthcare, public health and the pharmaceutical supply chain to launch Allied Against Opioid Abuse or AAOA, a national education awareness initiative to help combat the nation's opioid abuse epidemic.","And, finally, we listen and engage. The opioid epidemic is a crisis facing all of us in the healthcare industry and in our country. Our board, our management team and all of our more than 21,000 associates know that it is a top priority for AmerisourceBergen, and I know that it is a topic of significant interest for our shareholders. We're committed to doing all that we can to address the crisis and to providing updates and information about our efforts to you on an ongoing basis.","Now, let's move on to talk more about our execution and how we're seizing opportunities across our business. As I mentioned earlier, the strong execution across several of our businesses, especially in core Pharmaceutical Distribution, is helping to offset challenges at PharMEDium and Lash. Core Pharmaceutical Distribution, our PRO formulary, continues to perform above our initial expectations for the year and delivering in an evolving and dynamic marketplace.","Despite continued deflation, we are successfully growing our generic volumes. Our leadership and performance in specialty distribution, oncology and physician-administered product distribution is another bright spot for the company. In the second quarter, we remarkably achieved our 17th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth with the support of our business.","We continue to support the launch of virtually all of the new specialty products coming to market, and our ION Solution group remains a vital resource for physicians. Our ability to connect our physician customers directly with leading specialty manufacturers enables us to commercialize new specialty products and to contract more effectively, ultimately implying those physicians to best serve their patients.","Another area where we've executed flawlessly driving strong performance is the integration of H. D. Smith. The on-boarding of this business and the customer portfolio has gone smoothly, and we are very pleased with the customer retention to-date. Strategically, H. D. Smith was a strong fit for our core distribution business, and culturally we are seeing great alignments. We're also tracking well in realizing deal synergies. All-in-all, an excellent first 100 days after the close.","Another on-boarding and integration that has gone seamlessly is our work with the more than 1,900 Rite Aid stores acquired by our partner Walgreens. We're very proud of how well this integration has gone, and our team was just meeting with Walgreens last week and received extremely positive feedback from their perspective. So it's been a win all around.","The process was completed a few weeks earlier than we had originally anticipated. So we will now have a full-quarter impact from the additional stores for both Q3 and Q4 this year. And AmerisourceBergen has a strong portfolio of companies that are made stronger by their ties to the corporation.","Today, in a fine example of strong execution across our business, I want to highlight World Courier. Building on a great first quarter, this leading global specialty logistics drove compelling volume growth and overall performance again in Q2. A strong team and recent investments in the business are proving effective at differentiating World Courier, driving demand and establishing it as the partner of choice in the distribution of the most innovative therapies.","For example, our Cocoon is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective solution for transporting pallet-sized shipments of temperature-sensitive materials. Cocoon was recently recognized for supply chain transformation at the 15th annual Global Forum Excellence Awards and is helping AmerisourceBergen redefine what's possible in leading-edge pharmaceutical logistics.","In summary, as we meet with our customers, both healthcare providers and manufacturers, we continue to hear how AmerisourceBergen helps them navigate the complex healthcare environment and how much value we bring to the healthcare supply chain. We're extremely proud of this critical role that we play in supporting our customers and helping patient access the highest quality healthcare treatments.","AmerisourceBergen is strongly positioned for long-term growth. We are evolving and transforming our business to best meet the needs of our customers, drive value for our shareholders and ultimately serve patients. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results and our financial guidance update for fiscal 2018. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. For a discussion of our GAAP results, I would ask that you please refer to our earnings release.","Let me cover one new item upfront regarding our financial reporting. As disclosed in our first quarter 10-Q filing, we made additional equity investments in the two Brazilian companies in which we were previous equity partners, Profarma and the specialty joint venture. These businesses are leading companies in their respective markets, and we are pleased we can further deepen our strategic relationships with both.","Based on accounting rules, we are now required to consolidate these businesses and eliminate the non-controlling interest. To improve comparability to prior financial results and previous guidance, we have included a new schedule in our press release which illustrates the financial impact of consolidating Brazil. From a segment standpoint, let me point out that Profarma is reported in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, while Brazil specialty is reported in Other.","We can now begin our Q2 financial review. I will provide commentary in two main areas. First, I will discuss our quarterly consolidated and segment performance, highlighting specialty and generics, two areas that stood out in the quarter and enabled better than expected performance. And the second area, I will cover certain revised fiscal 2018 expectations.","Let's begin with our Q2 2018 results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.94, an increase of 10%. This included a $0.02 headwind from consolidated Brazil. It's important to note that there is seasonality in these Brazil businesses, with the March quarter typically being the slowest period of the year.","Our consolidated revenues were $41 billion, up a solid 10%. Gross profit increased 9% or about $110 million to $1.3 billion. When excluding the impact from Brazil, our gross profit would've increased 6% or $70 million. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment contributed most of this increase, and they did this while covering a significant year-over-year headwind from PharMEDium.","Operating expenses increased 19%, roughly the equivalent $110 million, to $692 million. Brazil contributed over a third of the percentage growth and dollar increase. Excluding Brazil, consolidated OpEx grew 12%. Roughly half of the 12% growth is the direct result of Pharmaceutical Distribution's acquisition of H. D. Smith this quarter. Since this is the first quarter of consolidating H. D. Smith, we are still at the early stages of integration and optimizing the cost structure.","In summary, on OpEx, let me stress, excluding Brazil and H. D. Smith, we are right in line with our OpEx growth expectations from the beginning of the fiscal year.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $586 million, virtually flat to last year. We're pleased that on a comparative basis, so excluding consolidated Brazil, our operating income would have been slightly higher than last year. We believe this clearly shows the strength of our core business fundamentals.","Our business mix and balance execution enabled us to effectively offset PharMEDium. In terms of operating margin, we were down 15 basis points primarily due to our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment's lower margin.","Moving below the operating income line. Interest expense net increase by about $13 million, or $11 million excluding Brazil, due in a large part to the new debt issued for the H. D. Smith acquisition. Additionally, short-term borrowings were higher in the quarter due primarily to seasonality of the business.","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was just under 21% and reflects the positive impact from tax reform and the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Additionally, this quarter, our tax rate benefited from a higher than expected contribution from employee stock option exercises. Compared to last year's March quarter though, the tax impact from option exercises was consistent.","Our adjusted net income after backing out the Brazil non-controlling equity interest was $435 million, an increase of 11%, driven by the lower tax rate and corresponding tax expense. Our diluted share count increased slightly to 222 million shares. During the quarter, we purchased a minimal number of shares, given our seasonal borrowings and lower levels of available cash. We exited the quarter with roughly $730 million remaining under our current board share repurchase authorization.","Moving over to cash flow and our cash balance. In the March quarter, our free cash flow was a negative, which contributed to our year-to-date free cash flow of a negative $250 million. We expected a better March quarterly cash flow, but we were impacted by timing. The initial inventory we purchased to on-board the Rite Aid pharmacies took longer to cycle through than we had originally anticipated, which increased our days on hand and caused a headwind to working capital.","In the month of April, inventory is down to a more normalized level and the working capital benefit we expected has now been realized. For the full year, we remain confident in our free cash flow guidance. From a cash standpoint, we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash, almost evenly split between U.S. cash and cash held offshore.","This finishes the review of our consolidated results. Next, let me switch and cover our segment results. We can begin with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Total segment revenues were just under $39.5 billion, up 10%. The segment's top-line revenue growth continues to benefit from our strategic relationships with our anchor, long-term customers and continued emphasis on the specialty market.","Our revenue growth drivers came from four primary areas. One, the completion of the H. D. Smith acquisition in January had a meaningful top-line revenue impact.","Two, we continue to benefit from the growth of our largest customer, Walgreens. Most notably, our revenues associated with servicing the acquired Rite Aid pharmacies increased substantially in the quarter. We exited the March quarter servicing all 1,900-plus pharmacies. However, in terms of the quarterly revenue growth impact, we serviced only about half of these pharmacies for the entire March quarter.","Three, our leadership in specialty and positive industry trends again enabled strong revenue growth. This quarter, our revenue growth was 12% in specialty distribution, defined as oncology and physician-administered specialty drugs. We had very good growth in lines shipped, especially in the oncology, ophthalmology and MS therapeutic areas.","And number four, the segment also had solid revenue growth in the independent segment. We continue to help our partners run their pharmacy businesses successfully by offering our leading PROGenerics (sic) [PRxO Generics] formulary, our best-in-class Elevate Network (sic) [Elevate Provider Network] which supports reimbursement, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy program, and a dedicated inside sales team ensuring customers optimize their compliance levels and contracts.","Wrapping up the segment revenue discussion, we continue having a higher than anticipated revenue headwind, 120 basis points from lower hepatitis C revenues.","Moving to segment operating income, we had an increase of about 1% to $489 million. Operating income growth, excluding Profarma Brazil, would have been up 2%. The segment benefited from solid revenue growth, including higher seasonal generic flu drug sales, and margins were somewhat better than we expected.","Additionally, in the quarter, we had a better than anticipated contribution from brand manufacturer activity, which we assume will result in a lower contribution from brand inflation in the June-July time period.","The segment results and growth were negatively impacted by a marginal PharMEDium contribution. In the current quarter, PharMEDium's shipped volumes were less than half of last year's volumes because of the Memphis facility being closed. PharMEDium's lower performance was less of a drag to the segment's revenue, but clearly more impactful to the segment's gross profit, operating income and operating margin. The segment was able to overcome this headwind in the quarter and actually grow operating income year over year.","As Steve mentioned, we remain focused and committed to bringing the Memphis facility back online. However, we are not willing to prioritize speed over our mission of best-in-class quality and regulatory standards.","We can now move to the Other segment businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health and includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenues were $1.6 billion, up 13%. Excluding Brazil specialty, revenues would have grown a solid 7%.","Our three primary businesses, all contributed to the revenue growth. World Courier continues delivering excellent results, with solid growth year over year in both the number of shipments handled and billable weight.","MWI had revenue growth as a percentage in the mid-single digits, somewhat impacted by certain pharmaceutical products switching between direct sales and agency.","On a comparable basis to last year, we were pleased with the results within the companion animal segment with revenue growth in the high-single digits. This is despite a relatively softer March in companion due to the unusual weather, especially on the East Coast, which dampened the sales of certain seasonal drugs by flea and tick treatments.","From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $97 million, down about 6% or $7 million. Let me highlight that just under half of this decrease was due to a one-time adjustment related to business taxes covering prior years we had to make in our Canada business.","For the quarter, our World Courier and MWI businesses both had solid operating income growth, with World Courier improving their operating margin considerably. The segment was impacted by performance in our Consulting business, specifically a lower contribution from our Lash Consulting business. Their Fusion implementation, which we have discussed in the past, has continued to be a headwind as we work to migrate existing customers. Lash's new business pipeline has also had an impact on the business.","Looking forward, we believe we remain on the right path at Lash. We recently secured several new business wins and on-boarded to Fusion, our largest manufacturer program to-date, with good results and high customer satisfaction feedback. Lash continues to be the market leader and adding this innovative technology platform enables the business to further enhance its differentiated offering in the market.","This completes our segment review. We will now cover our full-year expectations. For the most part, I will cover aspects of our financial guidance that are being revised in my prepared comments. I'd ask that you please refer to our press release for a complete listing of our guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis.","To remain consistent with how we have previously provided guidance, we will exclude consolidated Brazil. For full-year fiscal 2018, consolidated Brazil is expected to have an immaterial impact on our operating income and is essentially neutral to our adjusted EPS.","Before I highlight our specific guidance metrics, let me briefly cover PharMEDium. Certainly, we are disappointed that these challenges are impacting our full-year financial performance. Let me stress that the timeline for remediation at the Memphis facility is not driven by any new FDA observations. The process is simply taking longer than we originally anticipated.","Given this, we believe it's more practical to de-risk our guidance and remove any implied benefit from Memphis. Said another way, our guidance is now being revised to assume that the Memphis facility likely will have an extended phased ramp in production post opening. Any income contribution in fiscal 2018 from this facility is now expected to be nominal.","We're pleased that other aspects of our core business continue to perform ahead of expectations, and this includes the slightly faster ramp of the Walgreens Rite Aid business. This outperformance will enable a positive partial offset of the continued headwind. We remain highly focused and energized to reopen the Memphis facility with the highest quality and regulatory standards as a top priority.","Now, we can start our guidance review. Revenues, no change here, we continue to guide between 8% and 11% growth. Operating expenses, our revised OpEx growth assumption is now an increase of 8% to 10%.","During the March quarter, we determined that the exclusion of PharMEDium's remediation costs should have been recognized against cost of goods sold and not to operating expenses. This change caused an increase in both our OpEx and gross profit assumptions. Importantly, these changes were net neutral and did not represent a change in our operating expectations.","Taking a step back, stripping out consolidated Brazil and H. D. Smith, our OpEx growth is very much in line with our beginning-of-year expectations. And as we look forward to fiscal 2019, we expect our OpEx growth rate will return to a lower, more normalized level.","Operating income, we now expect to have relatively flat operating income growth for the full fiscal year. From a segment standpoint, we expect Pharmaceutical Distribution Services to be relatively flat, given the impact from PharMEDium, offset some by positive contributors such as improved volumes and margins, primarily in specialty and generics.","At this point, we are not revising our assumptions around the brand inflation rate or the generic deflation rate. We are encouraged that the generic deflation rate has stabilized, but it's too early to factor an improvement into our guidance.","Moving over to Global Commercialization Services and the Animal Health segment. We now expect operating income growth to be down between 2% and 4%. Compared to prior guidance, this decrease reflects further expected softness in our Consulting business, specifically Lash for the remainder of the year.","Moving below the operating income line. Tax rate, our guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of about 22% to 23%. This change is due to a better-than-anticipated contribution from the accounting for share-based compensation, most of which we just recognized in the March quarter.","Adjusted EPS, our fiscal 2018 range will remain at $6.45 to $6.65. However, we now believe we will finish at the bottom of the range, given the revised expectations that I've just discussed. In terms of the quarterly cadence, this means that we expect to earn just under $3 in adjusted EPS in the second half of the year, and we are expecting our fourth fiscal quarter to be slightly higher than the third quarter.","In closing, AmerisourceBergen continues to execute, address our challenges, and drive strong performance in our core businesses. As Steve mentioned, our relationships with our customers are solid. In fact, many are growing and expanding, and we continue to be the trusted valuable partner to these customers. The role AmerisourceBergen plays within the supply chain and our place in the larger market landscape strongly positions the company for long-term growth.","We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now, here's Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Tim. I'll turn it over to our operator, Leah, for the first question in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you We go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions, Steve and Tim. And I know you touched on this a little bit, Tim, in your prepared remarks, but I just wanted to be clear. If you go back to the changes, you're now expecting an operating profit now to be flat in the Pharma segment for the full year, and that does now exclude remediation costs.","I'm just wondering, is there anything else at play there that would cause the change, or I know you actually highlighted some good guys going the other way in the updated expectations, but just really want to try to isolate how much of the changed expectation was related specifically to PharMEDium?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Yeah, I mean, we took our EBIT guidance down roughly 2%, 2.5%. I would say that overall for ABC consolidated, overall probably 75% to 80% of that is related to the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and, in particular, PharMEDium. And probably there's 20%, 25% related to that change to Global Commercialization and Lash.","But, again, take a step back. I mean, we gave guidance of EBIT when we acquired H. D. Smith of 4% to 7%. We felt good about that. And clearly, we would be comfortably in that range without PharMEDium. So, PharMEDium has been a headwind. We're focused on it. But I would say, overall, PharMEDium has been the reason why we've dropped down to flat. So, hopefully, that answers your question.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Bob. Leah, can we move to the next call in the queue, please?","Operator","Yes. It's from line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, and good morning. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. So, with regards to PharMEDium and sort of ramping up production in fiscal 2019, did the customers that were being served out of that Memphis facility move to a competitor, or did they simply just bring that volume in-house? And sort of has there been any change in hospitals' views on outsourcing the service?","And then, just as a follow-up to that point, are you assuming anything incremental in terms of remediation efforts at any of your other facilities? I think there were some press reports about a cease-and-desist order from the State of California for the Texas facility. Any color there will be helpful.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, yeah, the State of California was not really unexpected. It was part of the initial observations that we had. Most recently, the 483s that the FDA announced yesterday were for our Lake Forest facility that were very much procedural, and really, Lake Forest is our headquarters. It's an administrative facility, not an outsourcing facility. So they were in line with our previous observations. So, very process-oriented documentation.","But we take all of them seriously. And we expect to come out of this with a very vastly improved communication with the agency and vastly improved and safe processes that will, again, underscore our leadership in the sector.","Tim, do you...","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, just a couple of quick comments. I mean, one, clearly, Mike, that for the most part customers are going back in-house. There's just not another large sophisticated competitor out there. So the business is going back in-house. That's why we feel like ultimately when we are operational, we can get some of that business back and get back to work to PharMEDium's into their business model and get that lost revenue back.","Again, PharMEDium, maybe I should've said this, PharMEDium being down is not a factor of remediation costs. It's a factor of lost revenue, fewer shipments, lost gross profit. And, again, maybe just to go back to Bob's question, I mean, I really want to emphasize that we talked about EBIT being down, but there are aspects of the business that are just doing really well, Steve highlighted in his script. I mean, we're really pleased with specialty this year and generics, and they're helping to offset some of that headwind. I don't want to lose track of that.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks so much. Leah, can we go to the next call in the queue, please?","Operator","Yes. We'll go the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Tim. So, just one more on PharMEDium. I guess, just in hindsight, I was curious were there any remediation costs back in the December quarter that could theoretically be excluded now from results? And even though those are being excluded, just curious how much additional remediation costs you might incur for the back-half of the fiscal year? Just curious if there's any frame of reference around that. Thanks.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. We did have some remediation costs in December. But, clearly, we had a larger amount in Q2. Year-to-date, we're at about $22 million, we've disclose that. And you'll see that in our 10-Q that we filed, about $8 million for the first quarter and about $14 million in Q2. And of course, we'll have further remediation costs in the second half of the year. But, again, as we think about our adjusted results, that amount is carved out.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank, Steve.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Alan (42:49) in for Mike. Thanks for the questions. Can you guys quantify or frame how much of an impact the recent trends in opioid usage has had on script growth?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I don't think we're in a position to frame that. But I will tell you that, first of all, I mean, sadly, a lot of the deaths that are being reported now are, as you know, not from prescription drug abuse.","Secondly, I was at an IQVIA presentation. I'm sure you all know Doug Long, and have seen him present million times. And I'm not going to be 100% correct on this, but I think he said over the last five years the scripts have declined by 42%. So, don't hold me to that, but it was pretty significant outside data that really showed the prescription drug trends for the opioids have gone down really significantly. And our own data would indicate that the trends are reversing.","And I know I have a friend who is a surgeon in New York and she just told me what the restrictions are on her. And we know what CVS Caremark have announced and Aetna has announced. So there's definitely being a lot more care on prescribing. And I think patients themselves are somewhat concerned by the media and worried about looking at alternative treatments and trying to avoid taking these medicines if at all possible, and many are, some aren't.","I mean, we also have that responsibility to those who absolutely need them. And I'll tell you that I've got a back problem that just keeps on occurring, and sometimes opioids are the only things that will help. If I've got a flight or something, that's what I have to take. But I'll just take them for that particular purpose. So there are very important medications, and there are no viable alternatives to them for excruciating pain.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then, switching gears, are you guys seeing better purchasing yet from Econdisc entering WBAD? And then, when do you expect those benefits to kind of hit their full run rate?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Look, we felt like both Econdisc and, to a smaller extent but also really strategic, PharMerica coming into the formulary is going to be really good for \u2013 we have a strong institutional pharmacy segment, and we've kind of been missing some of the scale that a PharMerica brings. And certainly it's not Omnicare, but it's definitely a valuable other cog in that formulary.","It pretty much rounds us out with the mail order. PharMerica, we've got just an outstanding portfolio. We are clearly the largest buying group and the most international. It's been set up for a long time. Don't forget, we came into an existing partnership before step two between Walgreens and Alliance Boots. And Alliance Boots has already been in so many different countries.","So we think that our results speak for themselves. We did really well in the formulary. Our compliance rates are up. We think our relationship and the strength of our PROGen formulary offering has never been better. Our analytics keep on improving and we're very happy. I mean, one of the ways that we've mitigated some pretty significant headwinds from EM (46:15) is with our strong PROGen (sic) [PRxO Gen] and generic performance, and that is certainly anchored by WBAD.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mark Rosenblum - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. It's Mark Rosenblum on for Ricky. I just wanted to get some color on how much H. D. Smith contributed in the quarter? And then, could you just give an update on how many distribution centers that you have operating at this point?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I'll just say \u2013 I'll let Tim handle specific financial guidance. And I'll just tell you quickly just and that we have not reached \u2013 though all the H. D. Smith distribution centers are open and I'm not sure if we say it publicly how many. I think that's probably well known that they have about a dozen operating centers, Tim, is that correct?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. So we are very thrilled with how H. D. Smith's integration has gone. We're pleased with the people from H. D. Smith that have come over. We think the customer retention has been better than we expected. Bob Mauch and his team, Tom Mullin, he runs our community pharmacy, has led the integration. Yeah.","It's straight down the fairway. And I continue to remind people, we go around and visit with investors, people say you haven't done an acquisition. I mean, there was a $900 million acquisition approximately with all the different fees and expenses. And we just stick with the one that we really had our mind, eye on for my whole career here since I've moved up to Philadelphia area. And it's gone superbly well and certainly at least at the very high end of our expectations.","But, Tim, I'll let you...","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I'm not going to give specifics but the revenues were very much in line with where we expected after one quarter. Remember, we closed in early January. EBIT was very much in line with where we expected. So we're pleased. And, again I mean, as Steve mentioned, this was a premier company, a jewel. I mean, we're going to be very thoughtful on how we integrate.","And as we move along through the balance of the year, we'll start to integrate, we'll start to get some sourcing benefit on pharmaceutical purchasing. So we would expect that contribution to increase in the second half of the year. But so far so good and we're pleased and the integration has gone well.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks.","Mark Rosenblum - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just in the beginning of the year, I think you thought it would be neutral to EPS. You closed a little bit earlier. Is that still the expectation?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No. I think we already said, after we went out and we did financing because I'd tell you it was a long \u2013 to take advantage of the rates, we said it would be slightly accretive, a few pennies post the interest expense. And we still feel pretty good about that.","Mark Rosenblum - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","And let me remind everybody too that some of the heavier lifting on, I'm looking at the network and DCs, will come next year.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Mark.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of George Hill with RBC. Please go ahead.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. It's Stephen Hagen on for George. So I was hoping you could talk about kind of the trends you're seeing in the both manufacturer and customer negotiations that you're having for both specialty drugs and brands, in terms of kind of renegotiating them and adjusting the mix effect that you've seen?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","On the provider side, I would say that the industry has been \u2013 it's competitive but very stable. I think we all have our core customers. We integrate with them. Our customer renewals have gone I'd say very well. We haven't had any big high-profile ones.","But I just was reflecting on this, as you get ready for earnings, you sort of have all these watermarks. And I would just say that when I moved to the drug company, which I referred to in the previous questions, and then ultimately became the CEO, I think our relationship with our customers has really evolved to much more mutually respectful, less adversarial in a way, not as much negotiating. I mean, I think there's a great understanding of why we're doing the rebalancing efforts on brand specialty, et cetera, the generic shifts.","I think that there's a much better communication. I think ABC has really moved up our strategic account management and there's been a lot of really strong people say on the Consulting side of our business that have moved up over to drug company. And I think, conversely, we want to really improve the operational efficiency in our specialty group through transformation. And so I think we've made a lot of progress.","And I would say, one business we don't talk about specifically but remains a really strong contracting entity with manufacturers is ION. And we've got Rich Tremonte and his Global Sourcing group acting out of Tula (51:31). They do an incredible job with the people servicing deals. And we do have consolidation always in the industry. We expect more consolidation.","I think manufacturers understand the different dynamics of ABC, the different portfolio offerings. And we try to be very consultative when we talk to manufacturers. We understand that Pfizer is now in the biosimilar area, they are and Hospira for example.","And Merck's got some just incredibly interesting look at their earnings release yesterday, some very interesting products. And we want to be there for (52:07) and we want to be working with them on offense. And as they expand indications for these products, we want to help them move into different segments.","So I think on the brand side, probably very exciting, cell-based therapies across the portfolio. And I do think there's going to probably be more M&A in the next couple of quarters that you'll see in life sciences. It's been a bit quiet, but you can probably expect that that's going to change I would think.","So Tim, any comments?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No. Just one, Steve. That was very well said. I mean, the one thing I would just say on the manufacturer side, we renew contracts. It's always in negotiation. But I think it's not only AmerisourceBergen, but it's the sector, the industry, I mean, that we all create just incredible value to the manufacturer, and we're just so efficient. We ship to so many different customers and providers. And, again, I think manufacturers recognize the value we provide every day.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, I see that you're kind of excluding or you don't expect any contribution from biosimilars this year. Just how are negotiations going with biosimilars so far? And what kind of profitability do you expect in terms of biosimilars relative to other specialty or to generics or brands?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and Steve can jump in. But we only have a few on the market right now, and I would say that we're pleased with where we're at. It's the initial start. The ones that are on the market are a better margin than the innovator drug. I think that's fair to say. So we're pleased with that start. As we see additional entrants, we would expect the margins again to be slightly better and improved.","And, of course, with Consulting, we have wrap-around services to help commercialize the product. But it's early stages. We're optimistic. We're pleased that the FDA is talking about ways to get biosimilars to launch quicker, more efficiently. And as clearly as we think about our long-range plan, I mean, we clearly think that that's an area of growth and opportunity. I mean, with our specialty franchise and Steve mentioned ION, our Consulting services, biosimilars will be \u2013 again, physician-administered will be a growth area for us and a gross profit enhancer for us.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I think particularly with the physician-administered products and those on the interchangeability issues that you see in some of the chronic medications, say, MS or rheumatoid arthritis, and that's AmerisourceBergen's sweet spot. And I just would point again to the record revenue numbers that we pointed to in our legacy Specialty Group. This is just an incredibly strong franchise. And I think those biosimilar products will slide right in there. We're going to be having ASCO at the end of this month. So it's a bullish time for our Specialty franchise, definitely.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Stephen. Leah, can we go on to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. It's the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. I'm just curious, a broader question on your diversification strategy here going forward, whether it'd be in Consulting or Animal Health. And in your intention kind of to focus on building either organically or inorganically in those areas and do you see kind of opportunities beyond those segments as well. And then, just a quick follow-up to that, I'm curious if there's a competitive response at all to Henry Schein's Animal Health spin in combination with Vets First Choice. Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. To be honest, that was surprising. I've known Henry Schein for a long, long time. They don't often sell businesses, particularly good businesses. And I know that it was a spinoff and I think it was pretty interesting.","So we are very convinced that Animal Health has been a great addition to AmerisourceBergen's portfolio. We're very active in looking at whether it's international or it's consolidation-type opportunities or even more service offerings, because it's a complex offering.","The practice management side I think is interesting in Animal Health, as it is just in pharmacy, as it is just in oncology. So those are the three community segments where ABC is very active, where we're very interested in helping preserve, extend, enhance the role of the community provider. So, anything in those areas would be very interesting to us.","We think very highly of our Animal Health business. We think, whether it's a Boehringer Ingelheim or a Merck, it's very interesting to have that added offering with the manufacturers. So it's definitely something that we want to invest in.","The rest of our strategy, we're interested in our specialty business and services. We really haven't changed. We don't want to own our customers. We're interested in helping our customers to be successful. If we do go international, we're more comfortable to work with bio-pharmaceutical manufacturers. We have very strong compliance areas around FCPA, et cetera. So, too much single-payer, government-auction type countries will not be a place you will see us be too strong in.","But we've also stepped up in Brazil and Canada. We made little investments in Canada (57:54) Innomar business. This is a business last two or three weeks ago, so with a lot of the Asian distributors, the Innomar model where we're doing a great range of services from pharmacy, to specialty distribution, to call center, to reimbursement management, all within one facility, including in Canada, that we run in (58:13).","And these are very interesting to global services companies and they dovetail very well with what World Courier is doing, which is just performing exceptionally well. We can't tell you how thrilled we are with World Courier's performance. And it's a great example of where ABC has added tremendous value to an acquisition.","So, hope that answers your question. I went on a bit long. And I know we're running out of time...","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","So let's move on.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","...so we'll move to the next question.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yes.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So it's good to see the inflation picture remaining relatively stable both on brand and generic. The President's Office and the HHS was out today just talking about the upcoming speech and saying the President wants to go kind of above and beyond what was in the budget.","I mean, I guess, as you think about the various things on the table and anything that sort of is relevant to your business, I guess how are you thinking about that environment and the stability going forward and some of the proposals, or at least what that could potentially mean for you in future years?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, I think the biggest concern for us is the health of our trading partners and particularly the manufacturers, and they have a lot of pressure from pricing. But I don't think that any of this is simple. It's going to take a long time. We all know that DC doesn't move quickly in these areas. There's a lot of committees that have jurisdiction. Healthcare is definitely \u2013 Senate Finance, House Ways and Means. There's a lot of different committees, there's CMS, et cetera. So there's the FDA certainly if you think.","So we'll be an interested participant. We think that our value proposition remains very strong. We think our role with manufacturers and customers is as strong as ever. And I think the Specialty franchise we have makes us even stronger.","So, Tim, any last comments on this question?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No. I think that I mean, overall, it's early. We'll wait to see what develops and kind of go from there. But I mean I would say brand inflation, I mean, there does seem to see some self-regulation, right? It's come down significantly the last few years and it does seem to be in that norm, right in our guidance, where we thought. And we'll wait for further clarity from Washington.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks so much. I think we have time for maybe one last question.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. This is actually Clayton Meyers on for Eric and Nephron. So, just a few quick questions kind of shifting gears a little bit. The Fusion implementation continues to be a little bit of a headwind going into this year. So I'm wondering if you could speak about where we are in the renewal cycle for that particular business.","And the other question is there's been a couple of manufacturers reporting a little bit of a lull in volumes in the March quarter this year due to what they call customer buying patterns. And maybe that's related to the deductible resets as we entered into the New Year. And I'm just wondering what ABC might be seeing as it relates to that particular phenomenon specifically in 2018? And thanks for sneaking me in.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. On Fusion, definitely it's been a big investment. It's a really complex implementation. We just implemented our largest customer and that's gone well. If we had the benefit of a rearview mirror, I think we would have started probably a year or two earlier. But it's going well, we're proud of it, and we've got a very bullish note from our CIO who was just down there a few days ago and spent a lot of time with the team. We have a new president in place there that we have a lot of confidence and he's been with ABC a long time and done a great job for us.","So we see smaller customer \u2013 new customer growth. But Lash has been, as reported to me, this is the 20th year since we bought them and this has definitely been the toughest year we've had this fiscal year with some customer losses and the transition and some duplicate expenses. Plus, it's just a very large personnel business. So we have a lot of fixed overhead there. And when we have the revenue being slightly down, it makes it hard financially for us.","But, yeah, it's a great franchise. Our market share there is still outstanding. There's no one who is even a close number two. Again, like all of our ABC businesses, I feel we're making the right investments for the long-term, so.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Great. And, Tim, did you have anything to add on PharMEDium? Sorry.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Let me go back and, as you go through Q&A, you think about something that you could have said a little better and I just want to clarify for the listeners, PharMEDium. There was a question about remediation costs. Let me clearly say, remediation costs are not in our adjusted results. They are one-time non-recurring. They're not part of the ongoing business.","So, when I talked about $22 million through March year-to-date, those are GAAP but not adjusted. And as we think about the full year for PharMEDium, again, any additional remediation costs are not in our guidance, not in adjusted.","Again, PharMEDium being down year-over-year is a result of lower shipments, lower revenue, lower GP. But let me finish on, they have extremely strong fundamentals, they have attractive growth potential and, over the long run, we are best positioned to capitalize on the market.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Great. Thanks, Tim. And, Steve, do you want to make closing comments?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for your attention today. Our remarks were some 40 minutes. We went a bit over, I appreciate that. I know it's a busy day today with earnings.","But, again, if you think about this quarter, obviously an awful lot of you will be thinking about PharMEDium. But we'd like for you to also think about solid execution that we had. Execution has been the theme that Keri and Ben have adopted for this year in terms of our communication with investors and I think that we lived up to it really, really well.","We couldn't be happier with the way many of our businesses performed. We've mentioned World Courier. We've mentioned ION. We've mentioned our PROGen program. We've mentioned our relationship with community pharmacies and hospital renewals, et cetera. All the full blocking and attacking. The Rite Aid implementation, the scale that we are helping to create with our partners at WBAD and Walgreens and the solid relationship we have with other customers like Express Scripts and Casa.","So we feel very well positioned for long-term growth. We have a great, talented team. We talked about Fusion, that's an example of a very well-placed investment that we're making. And there are many other examples, including the distribution network we have. We have strong growth, a strong portfolio of leading customers that we have often talked about as we want them to be customers for life. And we feel that our position in the supply chain is very fundamentally strong and is only improving.","So, thanks for your time today. We look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference.

The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in today's press release as well as on our website. During this conference call, we will also make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, EPS, operating margin, and taxes.","Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company.","We remind you that there are uncertainties and risks that could cause our future actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. For a discussion of key risk factors and other cautionary statements and assumptions, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and to today's press release. I would also like to remind you that we have posted a slide presentation to accompany this morning's press release. You can find it at the Investors page of website, www.amerisourcebergen.com.","You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss our solid second quarter results and AmerisourceBergen's continued execution within a challenging market. Revenues were up 4% to $37.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS grew 5% compared to previous fiscal year period. There were three key drivers to note for our results this quarter: strong performance across our specialty businesses, good generics volumes growth, and strategic and disciplined management of operating expenses.","As a result of this solid performance, we are pleased to be updating aspects of our fiscal year 2017 financial guidance, including tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range as we feel well-positioned moving into the second half of the fiscal year.","I continue to be very proud of how AmerisourceBergen is successfully navigating and executing in today's healthcare environment. That execution is driven by the daily contributions of our more than 19,000 associates, so I do want to take a moment to thank them for their dedication and diligence on behalf of our company and our customers. These associates are the foundation of our compelling corporate culture and our success in making AmerisourceBergen a rewarding place to work.","Multiple news organizations have again named AmerisourceBergen or one of our business units on their list of best places to work. And DiversityInc recently named us as a 2017 Noteworthy Company, selecting us from a field of more than 1,000 firms evaluated. I believe and studies show that companies with diverse rewarding workplaces deliver better long-term results, so this is an important driver of company growth on many levels. Again, thank you to the AmerisourceBergen team for all that you do.","Next, let me take a minute to talk about the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, where AmerisourceBergen has strategically focused its business. While there are challenges, the U.S. pharmaceutical market remains well-positioned for the long term. Key drivers for growth include an aging patient population, an improving U.S. economy, a robust pipeline of new anticipated brand drug launches, and an increasing focus on the relationship between value and outcomes.","We see both resilience and continuing growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals and, importantly, we see a vital role for manufacturer and provider services to support the market expansion over time. So, against the backdrop of these market conditions and long-term opportunities, how do we view AmerisourceBergen's role within the broader healthcare landscape. We define that role with our company's new purpose statement, which I think is particularly important in today's environment.","At AmerisourceBergen, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Everything we do as a company ties back to this purpose. When we provide services and solutions that improve product access, increase efficiency across the healthcare system, and enhance patient care, all that is done to fulfill our purpose. The value we bring to manufacturers, providers and, most importantly, to patients helps fulfill that responsibility to create healthier futures.","Let's talk about how are we delivering on this responsibility and supporting the growth of our customers, while also creating value for our shareholders. We believe there are four key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart and have positioned us for growth.","First, we believe we have the best customer base in the business. Our broad and diversified portfolio of growing customers across all our businesses performed well in the second quarter. We enjoy long-standing collaborative relationships with our anchor customers and they continue to be among the best positioned companies in the industry for long-term growth.","Walgreens Boots Alliance remains a strong and aligned partner, and we look forward to continuing to expand our relationships to deliver value. We expect to add the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime business in June of this year. Although, the profit contribution will be immaterial this fiscal year and we continue to be optimistic about the future addition of Rite Aid, we are also seeing impressive growth across all other key customers, several large community oncology practices and MWI's largest customers.","Additionally, as recently announced, we entered into a five-year strategic contract with Express Scripts for their brand business through 2022. This is a key win for AmerisourceBergen and an illustration of the strong relationships we're able to build with our customers.","For the past five years, we worked hard to be the best possible partner and provide the highest levels of service and value to the Express Scripts team. We are proud that those efforts resulted in a new long-term contract agreement and we are excited to continue to collaborate with Express as a distribution service partner of choice.","In the last year, our Drug Corporation has also discussed two important customer initiatives and we are making progress on both. First, our efforts to improve compliance and expand our share of wallet within our existing customer base are yielding results and helping us to grow our generics volumes. We've sharpened our focus on reducing leakage and on providing our customers with the tools they need to realize the greatest business benefit of buying within their Prime Vendor Agreement.","For example, our investments in Good Neighbor Pharmacy member services are helping to optimize front-end sales. We are providing access to business coaching, manufacturer promotions and new reporting tools that incorporate point of sales data. GNP also entered into a five-year partnership with the National Community Pharmacists Association to produce a series of educational seminars for members. Early response to those services has been extremely positive. We've had 50% growth in the past 12 months across our GNP premier level membership.","Second, we are making progress with our Drug Corporation customers on our effort to rebalance our contracts and specialty pricing strategies to better reflect changing market trends and shifts in product mix. This rebalancing effort is one we've embarked on over a year ago and we have made significant progress. Our customers understand the value this restructuring brings in and we continue to establish mutually beneficial adjustments.","Throughout AmerisourceBergen, we have the strongest customer base in the industry. We bring the philosophy to be innovative, integrated and indispensable to our customers. We are proud to offer the most advanced and business critical services and solutions to help our customers most efficiently navigate the reimbursement landscape and actively support their growth, especially in a tough healthcare environment. The strength of our business is reinforced by the high quality of our customers and our ability to develop these long-term collaborative partnerships. Working together to advance and enhance patient care, it is always our goal to create customers for life.","Our second differentiator is our leadership position in specialty, which puts AmerisourceBergen at the forefront of a rapidly growing market segment. We are very proud of our long-standing leadership in specialty. I should note that when we refer to our leadership here, it includes our market leading position in full-line distribution within our drug company, specialty distribution through our ABSG business and our service offerings to specialty manufacturers ranging from pre to post commercialization support.","AmerisourceBergen has a history of strategic investment and leadership in specialty. And in the second quarter, we continued to grow our footprint and capabilities. We are pleased to see continued growth of specialty products available through full-line distribution, affirming the value and efficiency of the Prime Vendor model with many products for customers across multiple sites of care including hospital, health system and community pharmacies. For example, we are seeing strong growth in hospital and health systems use of biosimilar that recently became available in full-line distribution.","In the second quarter, our ABSG specialty distribution businesses delivered very strong results with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter with that level of growth for this business. Our strong operating income growth was driven by overall volume increases, new drug introductions, expanded indications for existing products and good expense leverage.","Our market-leading patient support services, biopharma consulting businesses, and clinical trial logistics businesses provided by Lash Group, Xcenda and World Courier also continue to make important contributions in supporting existing and newly launched specialty products. With our market-leading franchises, AmerisourceBergen is a clear leader in the commercialization, market access and patient support of specialty drugs. We are proud of our trusted partner status and close collaboration with manufacturers and providers to ensure patient access to all types of specialty products.","Third, AmerisourceBergen's innovative approach to services and solutions is helping to drive our customers' growth. We at AmerisourceBergen know that we are a healthcare services company. Our value lies in offering our manufacturer and provider customers the most innovative and business critical services and solutions they need to advance their business and drive their growth.","Customer adoption of our innovative offerings has been strong, and we believe that is enabling us to grow within our existing customer base now and in the future. For example, our Consulting Services continues to lead the market and demonstrated very strong growth in the fiscal second quarter. We now have more than 5,000 employees in Consulting, working with all top 20 pharmaceutical companies and more than 150 manufacturers in total.","Manufacturer services are key to our differentiated upstream value proposition and we continue to grow the breadth and scale of our offerings. The value we provide through our product commercialization services and our consultant strategic approach was just reaffirmed to our senior management team at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores industry meeting when manufacturers called out to us the unique strength of AmerisourceBergen.","Another area where we are investing is our design of state-of-the-art distribution centers and our implementation of innovative IT solutions. To improve the customer experience and enhance capacity and operational efficiency, we are strategically building our new state-of-the-art distribution centers for our Drug Corporation business. In the second quarter, we brought our Olive Branch, Mississippi center fully online, both on time and on budget. Olive Branch employs the most leading-edge technology in our industry and is now the largest distribution center in our network. We're excited by the improved capabilities these investments provide and how they position AmerisourceBergen for the future.","On the IT front, we are currently building out a new robust technology platform to better support our Lash Group patient services. We're also continuing the phased rollout of our ABC Order platform; a state-of-the-art customer experience and e-commerce system designed by pharmacists for pharmacists that provide the intuitive tools to order effortlessly, manage inventory, access data and information, and resolve any issues quickly. Both of these business critical system investments remain on budget and on track for full implantation.","In addition, in January we rolled out a new order analytics module through our Swiss analytics platform, Certio, with generics manufacturers as the initial target. This module offers manufacturers unprecedented insight into the order fulfillment cycle. Order shipment and receiving align for more proactive daily managing of service and inventory levels. The module is an industry-first innovation and demonstrates our commitment to providing increased transparency and incremental value to our manufacture partner through analytics.","There are several other information system projects and programs underway across our business, all aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness while improving our customer engagement. All of these IT initiatives are examples of why AmerisourceBergen is the trusted data company in our industry. We plan to continue to invest in data solutions, analytics and internal and customer-facing IT capabilities to maintain and grow that position.","And finally, our fourth differentiator is our strong history of financial stewardship and proven ability to integrate acquired businesses, which together gives AmerisourceBergen an advantage in driving growth. AmerisourceBergen always takes the strategic approach to capital deployment. We are focusing on investing in the business, strong expense management, building long-term durable growth, and creating significant value for shareholders.","We are proud of our ability to integrate our acquisitions smoothly and enhance growth across those businesses. For example, a growth driver in our March quarter was the contribution from our strategic acquisition of MWI Animal Health. MWI delivered another record revenue quarter led by excellent customer retention, strong growth in the U.S. companion pet market, and its doubling of the number of corporate accounts in the past year.","Additionally, we are strategically increasing our investment in PharMEDium to support its continued growth. We are committed to the highest levels of product quality and patient safety and, therefore, are enhancing PharMEDium's QA and QC systems. This supports batch level finished product testing prior to product release.","The initiative will enable us to deliver the highest levels of product quality and patient safety, while also creating a compelling competitive advantage. These efforts do mean that we will ship fewer units and incur incremental costs as we focus on optimizing the QA systems, resulting in slight bottom line headwind for the business in fiscal year 2017, but we are excited about the progress being made here.","Turning to our capital deployment priorities, in the near term, as we've previously communicated, we are planning to pay down our $600 million in debt due this month. Over the longer term, we continue to approach capital deployment strategically and opportunistically and our priorities are as follows.","One: invest in the business. As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in infrastructure and quality assurance processes and to enhance our services and solutions product offerings all to better serve our customers and drive organic growth.","Two: strategic M&A. We are always evaluating ways we could further add to our value proposition and grow AmerisourceBergen through the addition of best-in-class and market-leading businesses. We are interested in enhancing our broad range of core capabilities to better upstream and downstream customers and build on our proven track records on M&A and success.","Three: share repurchases. We are open to and have board authorization for continued buyback of AmerisourceBergen shares, and we will repurchase when we believe it is the optimal way to build shareholder value.","And finally, four: dividends. We remain committed to providing shareholders with a reasonable dividend.","In summary, we believe AmerisourceBergen is clearly differentiated, strategically focused and delivering undeniable value to our customers and the overall healthcare industry. We remain resilient and have continued to execute in the fiscal second quarter despite market challenges. We remain committed to enabling the growth of our customers, serving patients and delivering value to our shareholders, and we are moving forward with a clear and defined purpose, unified and united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth look at our quarterly financial results and our updated financial guidance. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We have now reached the halfway point of our fiscal 2017 and we are pleased with our results to date. We're off to a solid start despite the challenging healthcare environment. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our second quarter financial results and then provide an update on our full year outlook.","We finished slightly better than we expected in the second quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.77, an increase of 5%. Our growth was the result of the continued strong performance of our ABSG specialty business as well as the portfolio of businesses we have in our Other segment. We also benefited from having a lower tax rate and a lower diluted share count.","I will review the segments a little later, but let's start with our consolidated results. ABC consolidated revenues were $37.1 billion, up 4%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment accounted for more than 90% of our revenue growth due to our customer mix, volume growth and the strength of our ABSG specialty business.","I should point out we previously expected the headwind from declining hepatitis C revenues to subside this quarter. However, this wasn't the case, and we continued to experience a sizable negative revenue impact. As a reference point, excluding hepatitis C, our revenue growth would've been roughly 5.5%.","The quarter's adjusted gross profit was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. Our Other segment, which includes our manufacturer and other services businesses, had strong growth, but this segment couldn't offset the gross profit decline in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, which continues to cycle through the re-pricing of two previously discussed strategic long-term contract renewals.","Operating expenses. We continue to leverage our infrastructure and manage our expenses tightly. Overall, our OpEx was up just over 1%. At the halfway point in our fiscal year, all of our five primary business groups are beating their operating expense business plans. So we remain disciplined, driving efficiencies without sacrificing customer service or investment.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $588 million, down about 1% due to our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.58%, down 8 basis points from the prior year, again, driven mostly by Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 10 basis points.","Moving below the operating income line, other income, net: this quarter, we recognized about $5 million of income primarily from the January gain on sale of the U.S. ground business of World Courier, which we decided was a non-strategic asset. Interest expense, net, was about $35 million, up just slightly from last year.","Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 30%, down from the prior year. Importantly, the tax rate was lower than what we expected for this quarter by roughly 2% because of two items. The first tax item: due to the new accounting rules regarding share-based compensation, we recognized a fairly large benefit or credit to income taxes related to employee stock option exercises during the quarter.","When we prepared our operating plan and provided guidance for the fiscal year, we assumed that any corresponding tax benefit would be recognized ratably or equally each quarter due to the difficulty in forecasting the timing and number of option exercises. It's likely that we will realize a significantly lower tax benefit from stock compensation in the second half of our fiscal year.","The second tax item: we recorded a few discrete state income tax expenses that totaled about $4 million this quarter. So, in summary, the favorable 2% net reduction in our quarterly tax rate provided a benefit to our adjusted EPS of approximately $0.05.","Our adjusted net income was up roughly 1% to $391 million, solid results in spite of the contract renewal headwinds and a challenging healthcare market. Our second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased 8 million shares or 4% year-over-year to 221 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the March quarter as we position ourselves to repay our $600 million note coming up in the middle of May.","We have $889 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program, and as we have said in the past, we will continue to consider opportunistic share repurchases in the context of our overall capital allocation strategy.","Wrapping up our consolidated results, in the March quarter, we had positive free cash flow of $673 million as a result of cycling through the normal inventory build from calendar year-end. Let me highlight that, during the quarter, we did complete the final working capital investment with our largest customer, Walgreens.","Our year-to-date fiscal 2017 free cash flow was $106 million. Looking forward, we expect free cash flow to be nominal in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonality and holiday timing, and then to increase significantly in our fourth fiscal quarter. We ended the quarter with roughly $2.4 billion in cash, with $715 million of this amount offshore. This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results.","Now, let's turn to our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.5 billion, up a solid 4%, with our drug company growing just under this level. Our drug company business experienced solid revenue growth in its retail customer segment, which includes independents, Walgreens and other chains.","Specifically for independents, a key customer group, our drug company continues to focus on capturing the appropriate share of wallet, which means improving compliance rates and reducing leakage. Because of these efforts, the business had another quarter of solid generic volume growth. And wrapping up, as I mentioned earlier, the drug company was noticeably impacted by the headwind from lower hepatitis C revenues.","ABSG, our specialty distribution business, had another double-digit revenue increase quarter with growth of 11%, driven mostly by volume. We continue to see excellent revenue growth primarily in oncology, but also in nephrology, MS, and specialty drugs for orphan diseases. Segment operating income was $482 million and was down just under 4%.","ABSG continued their high level of performance, growing revenues and gross profit while reducing operating expenses, a perfect formula for operating income growth. However, as we anticipated, our drug company was down year-over-year due primarily to the headwinds in gross profit from the two customer contract renewals we announced last year.","Additionally, as Steve mentioned, drug company also had a lower income contribution from PharMEDium as we begun to implement enhanced QC processes, including batch level finished product testing.","In the March quarter, PharMEDium shipped fewer units and incurred incremental costs as testing increased and wasn't yet fully optimized. There were several positives for the drug company in the quarter, including a better-than-expected contribution from higher generic volumes and lower operating expenses versus last year. Unfortunately, these positive contributions weren't enough to offset the largely expected headwinds this quarter.","We can now move to our Other segment, which includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting, and MWI Animal Health. Businesses in Other primarily focus on value add, higher margin manufacturer services. In the March quarter, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 6%. Let me highlight that last year's results included the World Courier U.S. ground business that was subsequently sold in January 2017. So excluding the ground business, on a comparable basis, all three of our businesses had revenue growth rates in the high-single digit percentage range.","Our MWI business had another fantastic quarter with U.S. companion animal comparable revenue growth at about 9%, primarily from the sales of new innovative drugs, growth within the current customer base and also market share gains.","From an operating income standpoint, this segment had an excellent quarter with operating income of $106 million and a growth rate of 13%. All three businesses contributed meaningfully to the dollar growth this quarter. This completes our segment review.","Now, let's turn to our updated fiscal 2017 expectations. Revenues: we are revising our full year guidance to 5.5% to 6.5% revenue growth. This means we expect to end the fiscal year with revenues in the range of $155 billion. We are still forecasting stronger second half revenue growth, which includes sales to the new AllianceRx Prime Walgreens business. We will begin servicing this business late in our June quarter.","Our overall revenue guidance is lower than we previously expected. The drivers of the change are primarily, one, a continued headwind from the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues, and two, brand drug that have been holding onto market share post generic launch are now converting to the lower price generics at a higher rate than we previously forecasted, dampening our top line. Let me highlight importantly that the majority of our forecasted revenue change is from lower brand drug sales, which have a lower gross profit impact to ABC and the lower revenue forecast is not the result of any significant customer losses.","Moving to operating expenses, we are revising our guidance to a 2% to 3% increase in full year operating expenses. Our businesses have been successful in leveraging efficiencies and managing cost appropriately. I should note that we have been successful also in reducing the expected ramp of expenses as sales growth has slowed a bit and we decelerated the opening of several of the new distribution centers due to the updated timeline for the Walgreens acquisition of Rite Aid.","Next: operating income. We now expect operating income dollar growth to be flat to up 2% versus fiscal 2016. This is due to the change in our revenue and operating expense guidance ranges, as well as a change in our expected contribution from PharMEDium.","As I mentioned earlier, the business is investing in enhanced QC testing. As a result, we will experience a slight headwind primarily in our third quarter, because we won't be at full production levels, while optimizing the new quality procedures. This investment positions PharMEDium to be the trusted high quality partner for our customers and creates an even stronger competitive advantage.","Income taxes. We now expect that our full year tax rate will be approximately 32% due to our improving mix of US versus international income that benefit from the account rule change relating to stock compensation and the anticipated benefits we expect to receive from completing our R&D tax credit project.","Adjusted EPS. As I mentioned before, we are pleased with our solid second quarter results and we are now revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.77 to $5.92, which reflects growth of 3% to 5% versus last fiscal year.","As we think about the next two quarters and our adjusted EPS cadence, since we had a large tax benefit from stock compensation in Q2, this means we will most likely have a lower tax benefit in Q3 and Q4 versus how we originally guided. Additionally, the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth will also be a slight EPS headwind. Because of these two items, we expect adjusted EPS in our third quarter to be now relatively flat to last year and our fourth quarter to have solid growth compared to last year.","Let me point out that the rest of our previously communicated fiscal 2017 financial guidance for ABC consolidated is unchanged and reaffirmed at this time. As we have done in the past, we are also providing our working assumptions for the pharmaceutical drug pricing environment. I will cover generic drug pricing first.","We are still comfortable with our minus 7% to minus 9% generic deflation range for fiscal 2017 at this time. Through April 30, based on our specific generic drug portfolio and mix and our fiscal year, we remain at the high-end of our deflation range. This is a key assumption, so we will continue to closely monitor generic deflation and provide update each quarter.","Moving to brand drug pricing, we remain comfortable with our 7% to 9% brand inflation rate assumption based on the data through the seven months ended April 30. Compared to the same period last year, we have seen a shift to lower percentage price increases, especially to increases under 5%. Because of this and historical trends, we continue to anticipate that we'll have a modest level of brand price increases in the June-July time period. Given the unpredictability of brand pricing and generic pricing actions, we continue to have a somewhat wider adjusted EPS range at the halfway point of our fiscal year.","In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter performance. We continue to focus on consistent execution and our core objectives, taking care of our great customers by delivering everything they need every day, providing value-add solutions to enable our customers to run their businesses successfully, investing in the right areas of our business with a focus on efficiency, remaining disciplined with expenses, and driving long-term growth.","As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we look forward to updating you on our progress.","Thank you, and here's Keri to start our Q&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Can we have the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for all the detailed guidance today. I have a question with respect to revenue and maybe gross margin as well. If I look back to last quarter when we showed 4%, you still felt pretty confident about the high end of the range and it sounds like hep C was the major item that you called out. As I consider the other items, the conversion of products, how significant was that in the reduction of revenue? And then, how did these run through to your expectation of gross margin, at least qualitatively, relative to where we sat last quarter?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Hi, Eric. Good morning. It's Tim. Yeah, the revenue, we did call out last quarter. I think the difference this quarter, I would say, just market factors. I want to repeat that it's not related to customer losses, it's market factors. Hep C \u2013 in the script, in the beginning call, we called out that impacted us about 1.5%. That continues. I think we had a disproportionate share of the business. We benefited on the way up and now we're seeing the headwind on the way down.","But the other item that we called out that's meaningful also, probably a little bit less than the hep C from a percentage standpoint, is the branded generic conversions. We just had a number of brand drugs that hung onto share, and we saw the change in this quarter. And again, I'm talking about brand drugs like a NEXIUM, CRESTOR, GLEEVEC, and again, those converted. That's not in our control. We don't manage when they convert and when that decision is made to convert. That's a market factor.","And I would say, in terms of how they impact the margin, I would say that, in all cases, we don't keep that generic. In some cases, we keep the generic and, in other cases, we don't. We don't keep that sale. And then, because these are older generics also that have been on the market for a while, they're past the exclusivity period and we don't benefit from the higher margins. So, again, a generic is always good for us, but it doesn't mean it's at a high margin or that we even retain the generic revenue.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Operator, can we move on to the next call, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess around generic pricing, and I wanted to focus more on the sell side part of the equation, one of your competitors lowered their outlook recently, citing a still very challenging competitive pricing environment, particularly in the retail independent segment. So, I was curious if you could just maybe give us an update on what you're seeing in that channel currently and just if you think about the outlooks that have been significantly reduced over the last couple of quarters. Just wondering if you think we're kind of at an equilibrium within that customer cohort.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I'll start off, Bob. Thanks for the question. Again, our competitors \u2013 I think, in many ways, of course, we live in the same environment, but we have lots of differences in our businesses, including capital deployment and generic profile. We're not big, for example, on the spot market, telemarketing, tough (38:51) businesses. I think there also may be some differences in the way that we measure that index now as well, at least we heard on the call recently. So our forecasting method has remained constant.","Tim said we are at the top-end of the range and we most certainly are, and we'll have to see how \u2013 it's a very fluid market, the generic market, you know as well as I do. And the key determinants are the higher price, the drugs are \u2013 the higher priced generic drugs are subject to more competition. Currently, that's an area where I think manufacturers are seeing opportunity, and we could see some more pressure, but right now, we're holding onto that high-end of the 7% to 9% range.","Tim, you want to add...?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, and I would just say, to remind everybody, that our minus 7% to minus 9% is based on our acquisition cost and how we track it. It's specific to our generic mix, our customer mix, our fiscal year. I think that's important. But also, on the sell side, Bob, we haven't seen a meaningful change. It's always competitive, but we're certainly just focusing on what we can control, which is growing our share of wallet with our existing customers.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Bob. Brad, can we move on to the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Tim. So, just a quick question around the SG&A. I guess it's pretty impressive that you found ways to further tighten the operating expenses despite simultaneously spending to potentially ramp for, let's say, additional Rx volume, mainly Rite Aid, some time in your fiscal 2018.","I guess my question is, I'm just curious to hear more about what some of the sources are of the lower operating expense savings that you're incorporating into the remainder of fiscal 2017. Is it mainly personnel costs or are there other sources of savings that you've found within the overall company? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","It started last year when we go through our planning process. We start that around May every year with it being a September year-end, and recognizing that we weren't going to have the robust industry trends that we had experienced in the past couple of years. And Tim and I spoke to our business heads, and we really instituted some strict expense policies.","And ABC had had a pretty good couple of years and I think there were opportunities. We felt there were some opportunities to take some expenses down. Our team is fantastic. Our culture is very receptive to providing good returns to investors. So I think we were very cautious, and it's worked out probably even better than we expected. The expense control has been impressive. Hopefully \u2013 certainly to ourselves and, hopefully, to all of you as well.","Anything to add, Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I think we're focused on it and we're looking at \u2013 we're certainly not eliminating positions that are customer facing and\/or create significant value, but there are always opportunities to be more efficient, and that's what we're looking at. We're in a tough healthcare environment, challenging, and our businesses know they need to respond to that.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. It's also the first quarter we hadn't lapped. We didn't have any new acquisitions that we hadn't lapped. It's the first quarter where everything had been lapped, so. Thanks, next question, please.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I just kind of had one follow-up and one question for you, Steve. So, on the M&A priorities, can you just talk about what areas you see as an opportunity? I know that, historically, you always talk about increasing the touch points with manufacturers, but can you help us, kind of like frame it? Are you looking for assets that you can leverage on top of existing relationship of manufacturers or expand beyond kind of like that base capabilities that you have?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","It's actually, in a couple of months' time, I saw Mick Besse, and it's almost 20 years since we bought Besse Medical, and Lash Group was also 20 years ago. And so, we've had a history, and I think a lot of our management team comes from the specialty group. We've had a history of adding in businesses that expand our services, but are very tied to pharmaceutical care. We absolutely regard businesses like Lash and Xcenda as core businesses.","We've talked a lot on this call about our investments in Lash. It's our biggest people business and we detailed the number programs we're doing. So we do regard that as an area of strong capability and strong interest. Again, those markets, those businesses, are not as well developed outside the U.S. In the U.S., we have very high market share and very strong customer relationships and a lot of opportunities to deploy capital to be more efficient. So that's often how we think about it.","So areas of focus for us are international specialty, which is an emerging area. We look at a lot of companies. We start with \u2013 FCPA is critical to us and the type of partners. We've learned a lot from our pro forma experience, so I think that's very illustrative to us. And one thing we believe we've done very well there is choose our partners. We've done really well with the specialty JV. Innomar in Canada is another good example of success that we've had where we are leading the specialty market there. So those are the sort of characteristics of a market we like.","MWI is \u2013 certainly, one of the reasons they joined ABC, is for international development, and we've done some in the U.K. Jim and his team are very active. I think we'd be disappointed if, in the next few years, we didn't get something done there. We think there's opportunities and we have technology to deploy particularly on the lot feeding production side, where the customers seem to be very sticky and we think, as land becomes more scarce, there will be a trend towards lot feedings. So that's something.","Those are some of the key themes. Tim has one thing he wants to say, no?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I just \u2013 no, that was well said and I just \u2013 we've always been consistent, Steve, and we've always been pharmaceutical centric and that's the primary focus where we can add value to a provider or to a manufacturer. That's always going to be first and foremost how we view M&A.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Brad, can we have the next question in queue, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks very much. I might have two quick ones here. First off, on PharMEDium, frankly, I'm a little surprised that it would get this much attention on the call for some QA and QC investments, but is it a stretch to think that what's really happening here is maybe you're buying some equipment from a company like Charles River and you're implementing new systems in the facilities like a microbials testing machine? Is that what's going on here and it's just causing some disruptions as you get those implementations done?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","First of all, the business is ahead of what our acquisition model is. I would say we had an exceptional first year there. And I think this year, we're strengthening the team. We're happy with Jenn Adams, who's leading that business for us and was the Head of Sales and she's had a long history of the business, what she's doing. We called it out because we've had some reduction in the quantities that they are producing and it's because of some very, really, ahead of the market, ahead of legislation procedures that we've decided to adopt around testing.","But we're doing all that internally. It's certainly nothing \u2013 I haven't heard of a connection with Charles River or anything. It's just really making sure we stay ahead of the quality curve, making sure we stay ahead of regulators. We are several times the size of any other competitors in that space and, of course, the regulators look to us to set the standard. So that's absolutely what we're doing and we feel good about the quality and the competitive edge that AmerisourceBergen and PharMEDium have, and we think our customers have also been very, very supportive. So we like the business and we continue invest in it.","So, I think that covered all your questions. Tim?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I think, Steve, PharMEDium has been great. We think they're operating really well. We just felt it was really important to say that we're going to continue. We're going to continue to make an investment in the company and it's \u2013 certainly, our customers care about product quality and we care about product safety, and we're telling people that we had maybe a little bit of disruption, and we will in the second half, but this is going to make us even better going forward.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks so much, Eric. Brad, do we have the next question in queue, please?","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Garen Sarafian from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Mr. Serafian, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Steve and Tim. On generic deflation, it's a key metric, so to give us a better sense with half a year left in guidance, if you were to assume low-double digit deflation on generics, what would it do to your guidance?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, Garen, that's tough, right? Anytime you look at one key \u2013 it is a key assumption and we track it, but it's hard to look at anything in isolation. In any business you're going to have puts and takes, you're going to have things go in different ways. But we have a $0.15 range. We felt that was important in the second half of the year because of brand pricing and generic pricing. So I really \u2013 certainly, that would be a headwind, but we'd have to see how it fits in with other puts and takes.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, but it would change our \u2013 Garen, we certainly don't think \u2013 we feel good about the $5.77 and, again, that's the low-end of our range even if generic deflation changed a few percent. We are into May, so we feel good about our assumptions.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Brad, can we have the next caller in the queue, please?","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, Tim, somewhere in your guidance, I'm sure you gave cash flow guidance. Can you give us specifically what the expectation is for this year? And I know with the Walgreens deal you had some new working capital requirements associated with that. Are there any changes with the Express Scripts relationship? Have they changed your working capital terms at all?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, but I'll hit the second part of your question. With the new agreement, same terms, no change, no impact on working capital. And just to remind everybody, our full year free cash flow guidance was to be approximately adjusted net income or just slightly above. And again, there is some seasonality in the business, we see it because of the holidays; pretty kind of modest in Q3 and then up in Q4, which is kind of similar to what we saw last year.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks so much, Bob.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, we knew a cash flow question was coming, Bob.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Brad, can we the next caller in the queue, please?","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to dig back on Express. Seems like a nice timing for you in terms of getting that five-year renewal done. Can you just talk a little bit about, given all of what they have going on, kind of the scope, potentially, of expanding that partnership in places where you may be able to provide them incremental value, particularly on the sourcing side as they'll obviously, potentially, go through a pretty meaningful transition during the timing of the contracts? I just want to understand how many incremental things you can do more for them versus what you're currently doing today.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, we are very proud. You'll recall that when this contract was signed first time five years ago, we really came from well behind to become the combined Express Scripts and Medco distributor. That was \u2013 we were very proud of that at the time and we're proud to continue. I think we were disappointed that we didn't get called wickedly good again on the press release. We thought that was a really neat adjective. But I think that we had some other great descriptions, future derisked, or.... So we struggle to keep up with the eloquence of our CEO colleague, my CEO colleague at Express Scripts.","But the agreement is largely as it was before, no big changes on terms. We were very mindful, of course, of changes in mixes which you'd expect us to do and is a theme with all of our customers from big to small, how the mix would change and what sort of contemplation of newer therapies like biosimilars, maybe cell-based therapies, but this framework gives us an opportunity to partner in really any category, and that's what we're excited about and there's also lots of good business reasons for us to work with Express on, say, networks, et cetera. We continue to do that. And we're really proud that they selected us and also for a five-year term, which we think is very significant with a company that is so scaled in our industry.","So that's about all I'd say. Tim? No? Next question, please.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, thanks so much. Brad, we can move to the next caller in the queue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. Steve, I want to just go back to some of your earlier comments when you talked about the Good Neighbor Pharmacy partnership with the Community Pharmacists Association, and you made some comments about the increase in the Premier Jim team member growth.","I couldn't recall what you said, was it a 15% increase or 50% increase? And I guess the question is how does that then translate into the, I guess, the margin profile of those customers as they move into that upper level? And how does that affect Amerisource's business, particularly in generics? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","You know what? Thanks for the question. We talked a lot about how robust the generic sales were. In fact, we now have over 4,500 GNP and Elevate customers. And that's, I think, one of the key things that Tim and I judge our management team on is, we're making these investments, what's it doing in the marketplace? And we are really pleased with how Elevate and GNP Premier are progressing. Part of the CPA renewal was to bring all their members onto Premier level membership.","Our view is certainly one that may be it could be a little bit biased, but we believe it that GNP Premier members are more successful. We have data to show that. They're more integrated with us and we have peer-to-peer information that could show they're the most successful pharmacy. And we believe they're the most reliant customers. They're customers we don't have to worry about on compliance, et cetera.","So we had a very good quarter with independents and we expect it to continue. But growing within our customer base and increasing that market share, so we've had very nice pickup on compliance and part of that is tools and part of it is emphasis. In my experience, if you point sales people in the right way and tell them what you want to accomplish, and we've been very clear that we expect to get compliance out of the contracts that we have, that we've signed and we think are very fair to our customers. So probably that's all to say there. Next question, please?","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Hi, Lisa.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back and just follow-up on your thoughts on the overall competitive market on the independents side. It's just \u2013 Steve, it just really sticks with me right now that what you're saying just seems to be very different than what we've heard from some of the other competitors. So can you at least just help me to understand two things?","The first would be you've been talking about compliance rates. Do you feel that your contracts, perhaps, are different than some others in the market and you have higher compliance, so therefore, there's not as much spot market or other competitive factors that are driving that? And then, secondly, when you think about that independent market, do you think of, beyond compliance, is there something else that's making your customer that much more sticky?","I just want to understand, is what you're seeing only what's going on with Amerisource or are we starting to see stabilization and perhaps somebody like a Cardinal's catching up? I just want to understand that side of what's happening in the business right now.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I think two years ago, one buying group switched, and we've talked about that a lot. And again, the buying groups, it's tough for them to switch because it is a shared relationship and most of us have had those customers for a long time. So we've been talking about this for a long time. It's competitive. It's always been competitive.","I think we face competition amongst our peers. We also face competition with reimbursement rates and making sure that our customers can stay in networks. And I always talk about this that we have three key missions at AmerisourceBergen in terms of smaller customers, and that's community veterinarians, community oncologists and retail pharmacies, and our goal there is to help them be successful as independent businesses and looking at all the forces that they have to contend with.","So, think about a standalone business and how do we help them? So that's why we do GNP and Elevate, that's why we do business coaching, and we do these type of things, clinical programs, we do these type of things across all three businesses. And one of the things that brings me great interest and satisfaction is when we can look at combined programs that benefit each of those groups, and we're seeing that a lot. Obviously, there's enormous differences between, say, an oncologist and a veterinarian, but there's a lot of things that they have in common, and we work on that, and we have a lot of shared experience.","But I would also say we've got a lot of good mobile tools now, so those reps that go out on the field, they do have key data points that they can share with customers about how compliance benefits them. We've worked very hard with our buying group customers, the management of those buying group customers to say we've been transparent, we're giving you the great price, this is how compliance benefits both of us. This is what we expect to get. This is what best in class looks like, and I think that that's been very productive.","And then I go back to those suite of services and solutions, the customers are realizing value, and I think that that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. As they realize the value, they become more adherent and we do better through that.","So it's always been competitive. We haven't picked up any new buying group customers. Some of our buying groups are growing, but nothing exceptional. We are really pleased with the pickup in compliance rate, but we're not complacent. We think there's more. We want to see that compliance rate be in the 90%s, so that's our long term goal.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I think just to add one thing, Steve. Again, to give kudos to our drug company, they've really \u2013 we've talked a lot about Elevate and we've invested there, so we've really made key investments. I think it comes down to focus by the drug company and investment by the drug company on Elevate and we're just big believers that it's service, solutions and the price in the market is the price, but you compete and win on service and solutions.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Great point. Brad, I think we have time for one final question.","Operator","And that final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk a bit about the Prime contract? What led to the win there? When does it roll on to your platform? Can you sort of roughly size how much revenue that will add to your book? Is it mainly mail? And then, also I think Prime has a preferred retail relationship with Walgreens, I would think that you'd be picking up a lot of the retail volumes as well. Any more color there would be very helpful.","And then, also the $3 billion in specialty business that Prime recently won from CVS, when does that roll on? Thanks a lot.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. So, we'll start servicing Prime next month, so it's really more of a fourth quarter event. A lot of it is specialty. The Alliance JV, Prime Alliance JV is mainly specialty products, and we were expecting it. And I think the relationship we have with WBA is enormously successful, and we have incredibly close interaction with them, and we expect that business that comes into their orbit becomes ABC business, and that's why we did the 10-year agreement, we did WBAD, the warrants, et cetera.","All of these were planned out four years ago, and we're proud as to how it's working out in the real world, and it is over four years now into that relationship. And we've been proud to help WBA grow, and make sure that anybody they bring into their sphere significantly becomes an ABC customer as well. So that's really been the goal, and that's what we're seeing with Prime.","Tim, do you want to just \u2013 anything on the top line volume that we've come to expect (61:35)?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, we're not going to size it. Again, it starts in June, and we'll have it, like Steve said, for most of fourth quarter. And just Steve mentioned, it's primarily specialty, specialty brands, so it won't be a big impact on the year this year, but certainly will be a better benefit going forward in 2018.","Keri P. Mattox - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Brad, thank you so much. I think, at this point, we're through the call queue, and I'd like to turn it back over to Steve Collis to make some closing remarks for the call this morning.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, everybody. Thank you for the questions. Our prepared remarks are a bit long, so we appreciate your attention, but we're just very proud of the quarter. I think we are achieving so many of our goals, say, in generic compliance and the technology deployments, and we also are very proud on the softer side of the recognition we're getting in areas like diversity. Internally, the purpose, united in our responsibility to create healthier futures has been very well received, very uplifting, and again, AmerisourceBergen proves to be a great place to work, a great place to partner with and a great place to invest in.","So many thanks for your time today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10:30 today through June 4.

And as a reminder today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time I'll turn the conference over to our first speaker, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thank you, Nick. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end results. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen.

We have a lot of material to cover this morning, so we might be slightly longer than normal but we will leave ample time for questions.","Now here is Steve Collis.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the pharmaceutical distribution market.","It is true that customers and manufacturers are acquiring more value today than ever before, but that is to be expected in a healthcare landscape where both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing increasing cost pressures and constant demand to demonstrate the value of the products and services we provide.","Our manufacturing provider customers expect exceptional service levels and innovative solutions, and have the good fortune of being able to choose between three extremely competent and high-quality wholesalers. While we each differentiate ourselves in specific ways, we are all very tied to our core supply chain businesses, with our own unique mixes of services, segment orientations and key customers, all of which will invariably lead to some differences in growth rates in spite of our sharing a common macro environment.","While it is true that we have said we expect our revenue growth to exceed the overall market growth rate, that growth is driven by our outstanding mix of customers, many of who are expected to grow faster than the market, and by our footprint in specialty, which also grows faster than the overall market. These two elements provide the organic growth that is the primary driver of our business.","We take the selection and development of our customers very seriously, as we believe those relationships are the foundation upon which our business is raised (4:06). In addition, the collaborative relationships we have built and long-term contracts we have signed with our key provider customers give us real confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders for many years to come.","I do believe our relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is truly unique. No other wholesaler serves all the prescription needs and partners so comprehensively on supply chain as we do with WBA and WBAD. This year, our relationship continued to flourish, and we all believe there is more important meaningful and profitable work left to accomplish. We look forward to facing the future with WBA as a strong and aligned partner.","I think it is also important to clarify our view of the independent pharmacy market specifically. This has always been an important franchise for AmerisourceBergen. And we have spent a lot of time communicating in our past releases and investor conference discussions, the investments we are making in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, business coaching, PRxO Generics and our third-party network, Elevate.","Like all investments that we make, we expect that these investments should provide us a return. Specifically with independents we are striving for improved compliance and share of wallet for our contracted customer base. We have deliberately chosen to work more with our established and proven relationships than to go and win new relationships that are not profitable or strategically relevant to our offering.","An example of the deeper more enduring relationships we have with independent customers is the nine-year exclusive relationship we signed this fiscal year with CPA, our largest independent buying group. This important customer is an innovator in their own right and has partnered with us for the long-term because they share our vision for the future of community pharmacy.","It is also important to remember that we have now anniversaried the loss of the independent buying group customer we called out in September of 2015. Since that time, we have worked hard to keep or win back some of the stores that were part of that buying group by rolling out significant enhancements to our key programs and services for our independent customers. As we have said, it took longer for those activities to gain traction than we would have liked, but we are pleased with the progress we have made.","In addition to those activities, we have made a deliberate effort to protect our market share with existing customers and to increase our rates of penetration with those customers, primarily by reducing leakage, especially on generic products.","As the sheer number of generic products has increased over the last several years, the sourcing opportunities that customers have had to acquire generic products also increased. As a result, we have had to work very diligently, not only to grow our share of wallet with each of our customers, but also to protect that share against the lure of short-term opportunities.","Some of those opportunities invariably arise outside of a formal RFP process, or from nontraditional competitors like telemarketing companies. Our philosophy has always been to protect and enhance the prime vendor relationships we have with our customers, which is the unique cornerstone of the U.S. distribution industry, especially when compared to other international models.","Our customers have responded favorably to these initiatives because they see the value inherent in sourcing all their products from ABC at a fair price. I commend our leadership and our Drug company associates for the challenging work that they have done in these areas. Specifically, I feel ABC has been very transparent, with not only our customers, but our suppliers and our investors about the need to look at different pricing strategies for specialty products in the retail, outpatient and alternate care markets serviced by our core drug wholesale business.","As we have said before, due to the cadence of different sell side contract expiration, these changes do not happen overnight. This philosophy is reflected in all the significant new long-term contracts we signed this fiscal year.","Moving on to our results, I am pleased to now discuss, as I had originally planned to do at the outset of this call, the successful conclusion to our fiscal year 2016. Today we are reporting solid performance in our September quarter. We met the goals and objectives we laid out for our business in early May. Revenues were up 6% and adjusted EPS was up 12%. We have made significant progress in addressing the challenging environment our core business faces and certain other areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group has also continued its strong performance through the September quarter.","In fiscal year 2016, we grew our revenues 8% to nearly $147 billion, grew our adjusted diluted EPS 14% to $5.62 and generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Over the course of the year, we improved our balance sheet, repurchased over $700 million of stock under our regular program and successfully mitigated the dilutive impact of the exercise of the two tranches of warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our strategic long-term relationship.","Our solid operational performance and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2016 have provided us with significant financial flexibility heading into fiscal 2017. Over the course of my five years as CEO, I'm very proud that the company grew revenues at a compounded annual rate of 13%, which drove an EPS CAGR of 16% over the same period. We've grown the business in a variety of different ways, including through making internal investments, through driving innovative partnerships with leading \u2013 market leading customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and by making thoughtful acquisitions to add to the capabilities and services we provide to help ensure we can continue to grow well into the future.","While we are looking ahead to a year that we expect will deliver growth somewhat below our historical rate of performance, I believe we have positioned ourselves well to work through the near-term headwinds and take advantage of longer term growth opportunities. The investments we have made and the foundation we have built will serve us well as we navigate the complex and continuously evolving healthcare landscape. While the precise ways in which we generate earnings will change over time, I'm very confident that we will continue to drive growth, because we provide an essential service to the global healthcare system and ultimately and most importantly, to patients and we do so in an incredibly efficient and effective manner.","Let's turn now to the performance in our business units in the quarter. Our Drug company had solid revenue growth of 5%, and had good performance in all of its customer segments. While our community pharmacy customers certainly face challenges in the rapidly changing environment, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. Patients are benefiting from the accessibility of pharmacy care and the expansion of healthcare offerings that are now being provided in community pharmacies. Tens of thousands of patients still turn to independent community pharmacies for all of their healthcare needs, and we are working to continue to expand upon that cornerstone of trusted healthcare. I believe the programs we are offering at GNP and Elevate, among others, will continue to add value to this important segment and allow our customers to maintain their presence with their patients and the plans they service.","This level of care demands a seamless integration of technology and personalized service and our latest offerings in these areas continue to grain traction. We want to make meaningful improvements to or First to Shelf programs for new generic drug launches and service levels in our PRxO Generics program have never been higher.","Having the enhanced ability to fulfill prescriptions for new generics immediately and to reliably meet patient demands for existing products are two of the most essential services community pharmacies provide. Even small improvements in these areas can help ensure that our customers are leaders in their local market and provide meaningful value to the patients they serve.","During the September quarter, we made additional progress in our efforts to evolve our customer contract strategies, providing brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. We are pleased that our customers are receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower-margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products and are open to finding workable solutions.","While we will always have some contract renewals in any given year, most of the heavy lifting on large market related adjustments required in our customer base is behind us and we can now concentrate on the deeper and more robust, collaborative work that comes from a shared partnership and a desire to create respectful, balanced relationships. During our fiscal year 2017, we anticipate and would hope to renew our contract relationship with Express Scripts. There are no other disclosable contracts we will be discussing.","Partnering with key customers and developing lasting sustainable relationships has been a primary strategic objective of AmerisourceBergen for the last several years. We knew the world would be changing quickly, and while we could not foresee every conceivable outcome, we believed that if we would partner with the right customers for the long-term, we would be much better able to face the market challenges together. Being able to take the long-view drives innovative thinking and is often the catalyst that unlocks the value that is obscured by uncertainty.","In addition to having the right customers, we need to make any right investments. A great example of this is PharMEDium, which had another strong quarter. We have almost reached the one year anniversary of the acquisition and we could not be more pleased. The integration of PharMEDium has been seamless and their performance has exceeded our expectations.","Our health systems customers understand the value of the products and services that PharMEDium provides, but it is the quality of their compounded sterile IV preparations that enables them to earn new business. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, hitting on all the important criteria we target for successful acquisitions; culturally, strategically, and financially. And we are very excited about the future potential of this business.","AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group once again had a strong quarter, with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and have long championed patient access to specialty products.","The economics of specialty products can vary depending on a few key factors, the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit, and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturers and the provider.","The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us attractive partner in nearly every aspect of bringing specialty products to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the markets for both innovative new therapies and for biosimilars.","Our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma, vaccine and physician office distribution businesses, or our third-party logistics business. Together the group is the undisputed leader in enabling specialty product success and is an essential partner for manufacturers for providers and ultimately for the patients they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as the focus on value and cost efficiency increases.","Just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians. Our network of oncology practices are very well positioned for quality initiatives, like Oncology Medical Home, which improve overall value. Additionally, we continue to invest in our market-leading franchise of dispensing practices that are leveraging clinical integration and real-time care coordination within and beyond the practice, to improve patient adherence and reduce side effects and waste.","As I said last quarter, the cost to administer products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risks associated with disruptions in care can be life threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates, and mechanisms on Part B drugs, and we'll do so in a way that is always patient minded.","While being focused on some key technology deployments, our customer \u2013 our patient services and consulting businesses also had a solid September quarter. The expertise we have in developing patient access and adherence programs, and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC.","Over the last couple of years, we have worked to expand the global reach of these businesses to further enhance our value proposition to manufacturers. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will enable new possibilities for growth by driving innovation and expanding our capability to provide custom tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers.","Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC, and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well, and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.","Turning now to MWI, they had solid results in the quarter and a very good year. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business where organic growth, new innovative product introductions, and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates of existing customers are improving.","MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It performs exceptionally well from an operational and financial perspective, and its management has made significant and ongoing contributions to the whole of ABC. Among the many reasons we are so enthused about the business is the operational synergies ABC has brought to MWI, such as their recently implemented WMS system and some of our technologies which enhance patient intimacy in community settings. Likewise, MWI has brought ABC opportunities for more comprehensive discussions with suppliers in an area where we are truly competitively differentiated. We expect to continue to invest in the animal health business, as it is an area which we have only just begun to realize the full slate of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.","Tim will provide the details, but I wanted to comment on our key expectations heading into next year. In fiscal 2017 we expect to grow revenues in the range of 6.5% to 8% and to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range that is flat to up 5% over the prior year. Our growth expectations have come down somewhat due to the increased uncertainty around brand drug inflation and the rate of generic deflation. We do expect, however, to return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of our fiscal year as we anniversary the customer contract renewal headwinds and we begin to lap some of the impact of decreases in drug pricing.","It is also worth noting that assuming that Walgreens and Rite Aid receive FTC clearance, we anticipate that we will begin to service Rite Aid towards the end of the fiscal year, and we have been making investments to ensure we are well positioned to continue to drive the quality, scale and efficiency that this incremental volume will require of us.","In summary, I have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. Despite unexpected headwinds in the year, the fact is we now just reported a 40% EPS increase year, falling on the heels back-to-back 20%-plus growth years. While I'm personally disappointed that our projected growth rate for fiscal 2017 is not as strong as our past three years' performance, I believe strongly that the strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated services is, and always will remain, a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provider customers.","Our management team shares my passion and drive for producing strong and sustainable growth results, while also delivering outstanding customer service. In the years ahead, we will continue to serve our industry with the same high level of discipline that we have demonstrated throughout the 15-year history of ABC and our legacy formative companies. We provide a vital service in the global healthcare system, and we do so with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients while delivering balanced, long-term value to all of our stakeholders.","Now I'll turn it over to Tim.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results.","As Steve mentioned, it was a challenging year in our industry and for ABC with the changing pharmaceutical pricing dynamics that we continue to work through. Overall, we did not finish exactly where we thought we would at the beginning of the year, but we successfully navigated a tough environment. There's a lot to like about our fiscal 2016.","Let me spend a minute and cover a few key highlights. Most noteworthy would be the Drug company's successful acquisition and integration of PharMEDium. We are very pleased with the results the business has delivered and we are also pleased with the new talent and skill sets the PharMEDium employees bring to ABC.","The second item, our ABSG specialty business had a very impressive year with revenues passing $28 billion and they achieved record operating income. And finally, we exit the fiscal year with an improved balance sheet, and importantly, we successfully mitigated all of the potential dilution from the shares issued to Walgreens as a result of the warrant exercises. It's great to have the warrants officially behind us. This will simplify our reporting going forward.","This morning I will cover three topics. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full-year performance, and I will wrap up covering our fiscal 2017 expectations.","Let's begin our Q4 review. Our revenues increased roughly $2 billion to $37.6 billion, up 6%. Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $464 million, up $7 million or 2%. We certainly benefited from our operating expenses being down by 3%. We've made a concerted effort through various cost initiatives to reduce expenses throughout ABC. This offset our gross profit being down in both dollars and percentage.","Moving below the operating income line, income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.4% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. I should highlight that our quarterly tax expense included a slight year-to-date adjustment to bring our full-year tax rate to 32.5%. This rate is just below the tax rate we had previously guided to as a result of slightly higher international income and favorable discrete tax adjustments we made closing out our fiscal year.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.30. Let me highlight, we finished fiscal year 2016 with 220 million outstanding common shares. Please remember that the 220 million outstanding shares is before the dilutive impact from share-based compensation. When combined, this number is used to calculate our diluted earnings per share going forward.","Next, let me cover our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $36 billion, up 6%. Our Drug company had solid revenue growth of 5%. I should highlight that we continue to lap very strong hepatitis C revenues from the prior year, and this created a headwind in the current quarter of roughly 1.5%.","ABSG, which is our specialty business, had revenue growth of just over 15%. The business has now anniversaried the addition of a 3PL customer that had been enhancing revenue growth over the last year. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see especially strong revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs growing in the high teens as a percentage. Lastly, I should highlight that this quarter was another record revenue quarter for our ABSG business.","Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $785 million, down just about 1%. We saw solid gross profit dollar growth in our Specialty business due to higher revenues. Our Drug company's gross profit was down versus last year, even with the addition of PharMEDium. We had the impact from two contract renewals with anchor customers, Kaiser, which took effect on July 1, and also CPA, our largest independent buying group customer.","There is strategic importance in signing these large, fast-growing customers to longer-term contracts. However, in the 12 months following the resigning, the change in economics to bring the contract to the appropriate market price can be a meaningful headwind. Also, during the current quarter, we had a lower contribution from drug price inflation. These were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit dollars in our Drug company business.","Segment operating expenses were $391 million, and were down versus the prior year by 3% or about $14 million. Both the Drug company and ABSG continue to closely manage their cost structures to ensure they are spending in the right areas. On a comparable basis to last year, so excluding the impact from PharMEDium, the segment's OpEx would have been down nearly 7%. Adjusted segment operating income was $394 million, which is up 1%. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug company.","We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, our patient services consulting business, and World Courier. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 5%. Both our consulting and World Courier businesses had solid revenue growth in the quarter. Our MWI business was a little lower in terms of revenue growth this quarter due to a combination of two things; an impact from foreign currency from their UK business, and an impact also from some expected seasonality in their U.S. business.","Let me point out we continue to be very pleased with the U.S. companion animal side of the business, which had growth of nearly 6%. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $70 million, up 4%. The growth is after year-end compensation incentive true-ups in all three businesses. Additionally, our consulting business is deep into their new ERP system implementation. Certain expenses that can't be capitalized negatively impacted the segment. These two items essentially reduced the growth rate by slightly more than half this quarter. This completes our review of the September quarter.","I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal year 2016 financial metrics. Revenue, our full-year growth was a very good 8%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our specialty business, finished the year at $28.5 billion, with revenue growth of 17%. Just an outstanding year for this business. Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to just over $2 billion. EPS, our full-year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.62, up 14%, due primarily to our operating income growth mostly from our ABSG business and also having MWI for a full fiscal year.","Our Drug company had a challenging year, with the negative impacts from contract renewals and industry drug pricing headwinds, but the benefit from PharMEDium helped to offset these items. Free cash flow, we had a terrific finish to our fiscal year. We ended at $2.7 billion in free cash flow. Our fourth quarter was much better than previously anticipated due to higher revenues and certain one-time working capital benefits at ABSG, as well as a greater than expected positive impact from ending our year on a Friday, which is our best cash receipts day.","Now, let's turn to fiscal 2017 expectations. Before I start working through specific guidance items, I will make some overarching comments. Importantly, we have not included any impact to our P&L and cash flow from our largest customer, Walgreens, successfully completing their acquisition of Rite Aid. In light of the current pharmaceutical market dynamics, I want to comment on three key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand drug pricing. During fiscal 2016, our brand inflation rate finished right at 10%. We did see some further moderation from the 10% during September and it has continued through October.","So as we think about fiscal 2017, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to a range of 7% to 9%. Lowering this range translates to a gross profit headwind to our fiscal 2017 growth targets. The next period where we traditionally see a high level of announcement activity will be during the month of January. Consequently, we have a period of time before we know how we are tracking against this assumption.","Next, generic drug pricing. We continue to expect a contribution from a modest level of price increases, but overall, our generic drug basket is expected to deflate in the 7% to 9% range during fiscal 2017. This rate is consistent with what we experienced the second half of fiscal 2016, and importantly, recent trends in the market indicate that the generic deflation rate has not improved, unfortunately. In fiscal 2017, the generic deflation rate will be a gross profit headwind for the entire fiscal year, as opposed to just a partial year in fiscal 2016. And finally, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-to-year.","We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal 2017. Revenues, we expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the range of 6.5% to 8%. While the decrease in the rate of brand drug inflation will weigh on our Drug company's revenue growth, we expect our ABSG specialty business to grow slightly above 10%. In the Other segment, we expect revenues to grow between 7% and 8%.","Consolidated gross profit, we don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our Drug company business will have a significant gross profit headwind from two key customer contract renewals, CPA through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, and Kaiser through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.","Consolidated operating expenses, we expect a growth rate in this area of roughly 6% to 7% in fiscal 2017. On past calls, we have noted that we are incurring incremental operating expenses related to strategic systems and technology we are implementing across the organization. Since these systems are all fairly significant in size and scope, most will be implemented while running parallel with existing systems.","Let me also point out that our Drug company is underway with a large capital project that will both upgrade and also expand capacity in their distribution center network, due in part to our expectation that eventually we will serve the Rite Aid stores on behalf of Walgreens.","We are currently building seven new distribution centers. Two of these are incremental to the network, while the remaining five are relocations to larger, more modern facilities. As a reference point, the five relocations, so the DCs that are being replaced, averaged 32 years in service life. Most of the associated dollars spent will be capitalized; however, this is also the same situation where we expect to incur duplicate expenses as we operate both the new and old distribution centers for a period of time. These IT systems and infrastructure investments support our growth, improve the customer experience, and ultimately increase our operating efficiency. However, there is a negative impact to our fiscal 2017 operating expense growth rate of a couple of percentage points.","Consolidated adjusted operating income, we expect ABC operating income dollars to be in the range of down slightly to up 4%. This is driven by our Drug company having EBIT that is flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We do expect good organic growth in our ABSG business, but not enough to offset the lower growth in the Drug company from the gross profit headwinds I called out previously. We expect the Other segment to grow EBIT in the high single-digit percentage range.","Switching to operating margin, we expect consolidated margin to be down 5 basis points to 10 basis points, due primarily to mix of business, so large customers growing faster, and the impact from our large contract renewals.","Tax rate, our guidance assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate in the range of 33%. Share repurchases, our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, enough to offset the dilutive impact from equity incentives. We are pleased that we are able to announce this morning in our earnings release our new $1 billion share authorization. We now have capacity of about $1.1 billion. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.","Adjusted EPS, over the last few months, unpredictability around pharmaceutical pricing has increased; therefore, we are lowering our expected fiscal 2017 EPS growth rate, and also widening the range until such time that we have more clarity on these pharmaceutical pricing dynamics, both brand inflation and the rate of generic drug deflation. Consequently, we expect our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.63 to $5.88. The growth rate range is now flat to up 5% over our fiscal year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.62.","Also, please note that we have not included any financial impact from the implementation of Medicare Part B demonstration project in our adjusted EPS guidance. It's quite possible the Part B demo project will be delayed, altered, or even litigated.","Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression, given the two large headwinds I called out previously, the two key contract renewals, and moderating brand drug price inflation. We expect that our Q1 2017 adjusted EPS will be several cents below our actual results from Q1 2016. We also expect Q2 to be relatively flat to last year's results. We expect to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycle through these headwinds and have easier comparables.","Switching to cash flow. First, CapEx is expected to be slightly higher in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. It's likely we will reach $500 million due to the heavy capital investment underway funding both the new IT systems and distribution centers.","Debt repayments, we do have a $600 million note that will mature in May 2017. The proceeds from this note were used to partially fund the repurchases of shares under our special share program. Now that the warrants are completed, it's our intent to repay this note at maturity.","Free cash flow, we now expect our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to be at or slightly above our adjusted net income. The expected year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to the following discrete items; one, the cash-timing benefit we received from ending the year on a Friday. This benefit won't repeat. We estimate this impact to be roughly $500 million. Two, the continued investment in working capital with Walgreens, and three, certain one-time working capital improvements at our ABSG business that won't repeat in fiscal 2017.","As I wrap up, I know that both Steve and my comments were especially long this morning, due to covering several important topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention. I would like to personally thank the ABC team for all the efforts made this year, delivering solid results in a challenging time for the industry. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, but the challenging times are still with us. With our outstanding customer portfolio, our ability to execute and our financial resources, we are confident we will be able to continually adapt to working in a dynamic environment, and most importantly, delivering compelling, long-term shareholder value.","We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here is Barbara to start our Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Tim. We'll now open the call to questions. This morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Nick, would you please go ahead with the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question today will come from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Do you anticipate any changes in the scope of the Express Scripts contract? Or will that simply be business as usual? And then, quickly, how \u2013 if the Rite Aid deal were to close today, how quickly could you layer on those revenues?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Bob, for the question. Yeah, firstly on Express Scripts, we don't \u2013 we're subject to negotiation. We've always tried to do more. We haven't really been successful. There's a new CEO there who we actually worked with when he was at Accredo. So we are always optimistic, but there's not going to be a big headwind from the renewal of this contract because at the moment, it's primarily brand, and we have been very successful in improving the overall scope of relationships in almost all of our contract renewals so one would hope that this would be the same.","And then the second part of the question?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Rite Aid, I mean...","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Oh, the Rite Aid. Go ahead.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I would just say, I mean, I think our Drug company is excellent at execution. They're very good and onboarding customers. Certainly, that's a little premature, I mean, they \u2013 certainly, Walgreens has to get through FTC, but again, I think we would work hard and diligently to onboard as quickly as possible if they were successful.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah. I just would add that \u2013 thanks, Tim \u2013 that WBA needs to honor its existing contract agreements, but it's not like we're not aware of what could occur again. We have been very planful. So thanks for the question, Bob.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Next question please.","Operator","That will come from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. Steve, I appreciate your comments on how there are differences between the three wholesalers' mix of customers, but I think many of us have operated under the assumption that the market's very efficient, just given the consolidated nature of the wholesale channel. So just trying to get a little bit more comfort around how more severe pricing commentary from your peers \u2013 seemingly more severe pricing commentary from your peers, wouldn't eventually be a reality for everyone in the industry?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I mean, we've got a lot of, we think, heavy lifting on our contracts behind us. We talk about \u2013 six months ago, I think we discussed this and we reflected in guidance, which we took very seriously. Of course, since then, the inflation rate in brands and deflation rate in generics has changed, but let me talk about it this way. I mean, my comments on \u2013 are I think very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen. I can't talk about the others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way.","The environment is probably more challenging, and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You've got a lot going on the M&A side with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone is facing cost and efficiency challenges. And I would say our customers are more consolidated, more informed and have always been very sophisticated and quite adept at demanding value from us. And I think our industry has been responsive, and maybe we just haven't had as many tailwinds as we usually have, but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years. And we pointed in my script towards working within our customer base. So, I think that's a key point for us, and getting more compliance from those relationships. Tim, you want to add anything?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I would just say, Bob, that we feel like we've been very disciplined, responsible. We've met expectations of our customers, the anchor customers, CPA. But I think the important thing is, when we do meet a market price we get a long-term contract, and we think that is critical. And typically, the new contracts that we're signing have a specialty drug component or flexibility. So that's the exchange, securing the customers to a long-term contract, where there's mutual advantages to both ABC and the customer.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks. Nick, could we go to the next question, please.","Operator","Certainly, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Tim. So, there has been some mixed views on how much the earning sensitivity may be for drug distributors related to brand inflation. So, I guess just with your change in your view from what was 10% to 12% previously to 7% and 9%, is there maybe just any way to give a little more color on how much of a role that plays within your shift in the EPS growth from \u2013 Looks like about 4% to 6%, to 0% to 4% for fiscal 2017? Without getting too granular, just wondering is that a big part or a small part? Just any more color would be helpful. Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I'll let Tim comment, but I just would say, most of the growth has come from the specialty drugs, most of the unit growth, but they tend to be very expensive products, of course, not that many units. And then, there has been a relatively high rate, at least in 2015 of brand price appreciation, which was in the mid-teens. But, we saw it ramp down very significantly and current trends would indicate even a further step down.","We do think that an overall industry growth rate is very helpful to growing our top line and our bottom line. But we're confident we can grow in this 6% to 9% range that we expect. We said 7% to 9%, but I'm just saying within 1% or 2%. If it comes a lot below that, we think that that will create some challenges that we will address, but we don't think that that's possible in the next 12 months. Tim, would you agree to that, anything to add?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, Steve. Thanks. No, I'd just add something very quickly. I would say \u2013 Steve, good morning, and I would say that most of the change in our guidance is related to that brand pricing change, but there's also a small part related to generic. The deflation rate, we guided to 7% to 9% deflation rate, we're probably on \u2013 a little bit over that 9% right now. So, as we enter fiscal year 2017, we're starting on the high side, not quite 10%. But, so that's really the two things. Primarily brand and to a lesser extent the generic side.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks. Nick, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. That would come from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Steve and Tim. I wanted to get back to the competitive landscape that's been such a big part of the conversation lately. First, just to be clear, are you maintaining the same pricing structure and strategy for your independents on a like-for-like basis? And secondly, you provided some commentary in the beginning, Steve, but you guys have always prided yourselves on having solid pricing data analytic capabilities. So any insights from the analytic work that you have done to sort of help us reconcile on what the various distributors are saying? Thank you.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I would say that the consolidation, although they don't acquire them, our independents are largely characterized \u2013 almost all of our independents now belong to buying groups. I came into the Drug company in 2009 and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in specialty, the wholesalers usually owned or were very involved in at least in oncology with our buying groups, and the same is true of say, Besse Medical. So, this is a function of the market, and for the most part we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups. That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example.","So, as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high-teens generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last, because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing, and how that's going to change over, say, a nine-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that, you have to be thoughtful of that, because ABC is always thinking about the long-term and what does that nine year contract look like. And just because in the last nine years contracts have invariably improved, it doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same ways. And that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies, and that's a lot how we're thinking about things.","I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics, and then it's an important question. So, I'll let Tim also comment. But, as the groups consolidate, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts. But to the independent practice, we would say that 2,000 are very important, very critical, and that they're very aware of the pricing.","I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or, in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well. So those are the sort of discussions that we think are important. But they're not new. They've been going on for a long time. Any comments?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, Steve, I think that's well said. We gather intel, we do a lot of data analytics. And we just \u2013 we always want to make sure we have the appropriate price to our customer. And we really can't comment on trying to reconcile our situation to the other wholesalers. I think Steve mentioned, we've gone through the heavy lifting of contract renewals and we feel like we're getting past that. So, I think that is probably our comment on that question, Garen.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Garen. Next question, please?","Operator","Okay, that will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Hi, Ricky.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the comments. I have a quick follow-up here. So, first of all, just to confirm, does guidance assume any new share gains from independent groups beyond what you already have gained year-to-date? That's first.","And then my second question is if you can just give us a little bit more color on the branded inflation. I know in past quarter, I think, you mentioned that I think, now only 10% of your contracts with manufacturers are tied to or contingent on inflation. Can you maybe give us some more color on what percent of EBIT is tied to these agreements? Thank you.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Our growth rate in independents \u2013 when we talked about it, I mean, we're talking about really growing by 1% or 2%, which is really just making sure we get our fair share of wallet with our contracted customers. We feel that we have mutual respect with the customers and we've given them we think fair pricing contracts and in return we should get all their generic compliance. And there has been some, you can call it interlopers in the market, where they come and maybe even slice off some brand products and that makes the generic compliance look better.","We're saying to our independent customers, we want all your business. We're contracting with you. And that's where we've been focused. And those, I think, are very legitimate and bilateral discussions that we should have. And I think that's where we've made progress.","As far as what the amount of brand contracts that are covered by fee-for-service, essentially all of our contracts are covered by fee-for-service. There are some where there's an outcome that could vary depending on the rate of inflation that they experience in their own portfolio. We are moving quickly to close that, as the market changes.","So, we are in those discussions. We don't think that that reflects the current market, or the sort of bilateral mutually respectful agreements that we should have with our large branded manufacturers. So, those discussions are ongoing right now. Peyton Howell and her team are on it, and I think we're making progress there. But still more work to be done there for sure. Tim, anything to add?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, we'll be consistent with what we said in the past. Typically, we've said that about 10% of our gross profit dollars are under those contracts that are \u2013 Steve talked about kind of the non-traditional, the type that are \u2013 have an element of price appreciation, and Steve mentioned we're working hard to reduce that number. So I think...","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Okay. All right. Thanks, Ricky.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Ricky.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Ricky. Next question.","Operator","The line of Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I think I'll follow the same line, but maybe a few items that were implicit, let's make explicit. So one item you mentioned that you look to gain share back with the lost buying group from 2015, was that effort limited in scale to APCI (55:31)? And at this point, has that been successful? I guess the broader question from that is you said better to maximize compliance than go after incremental share. Were there any other areas where you became incrementally more aggressive? And then third, your comment on telemarketers and other competition, do you see the competition in the marketplace where it has increased from the other large-scale distributors, or do you think there are more interlopers playing a larger role?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, I'll make a quick comment on each of those three. We did lose a buying group customer. It was a customer where a lot of the members were GNP members and a lot of them chose to stay with us. But I don't want to get too much into specifics. It's not that overall material. I think it's always interesting, lose a relationship with a \u2013 and I think it's a shared relationship, between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why that having long-term contracts is extremely important, so that we can work together on what \u2013 the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script.","So I think actually that last year is a pretty good example of that and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC, but not \u2013 it's one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything, or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independents is very \u2013 I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we've signed. And we did work to try \u2013 keep some of those former buying group customers that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market, because again, people talk to each other. It's an efficient market, so we want to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced.","And then the telemarketers, I would say are struggling a bit, because I think ourselves and our peer companies are looking at that compliance factor and have better tools to manage that. And there's not the growth that you had from so many new product launches. And I talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, no need for you to order from a telemarketer. We're going to get that product to you first. And that's one of the examples, Eric, of an enhancement we've made to our business. I think, Tim, I've covered everything. So we'll probably move on to the next question.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks. Next question please, Nick.","Operator","That's from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to go back, Steve, to your comment where you talked about different pricing strategy for specialty, and you have new long-term contracts now in place with a number of your customers. My understanding is that historically, it was a branded bucket, that specialty was included in a generic bucket, and now trying to break out specialty. Can you talk about what the new pricing strategy looks like? And am I correct in thinking that when it was in the branded budget, you were discounting that, similar to branded where maybe it's WAC minus 3%? And what could the new economics look like in the new separation of specialty?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, Lisa, I mean, I'd say essentially you're accurate on my commenting on the WAC minus 3%, but you're essentially accurate. I mean, we had such a good surge in generic compliance and generic rates that maybe our industry was not as thoughtful about this as we should. And then we had that really fall off and specialty products increase so much, which are very expensive. And there is an argument with the manufacturer, there's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market-based fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult time, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers.","So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend and we're working hard, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important weighting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that there's a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service. So it should be a differentiated brand markdown, to respond directly to your question.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Lisa. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. That comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much, and a whole lot of mine have been covered, but I was hoping we could just get a data point that I think a lot of people have recently scrambled for, which is could Amerisource provide an update on the number of independent pharmacies that you work with, and maybe where that is today versus the past? And perhaps provide some definition around how you would include an independent GPO in that count. Just trying to get a sense on where independents are as a percent of your total revenue, or number of stores, or some additional metrics. Thank you.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We have a very tiered system. We haven't picked up a lot of new customers. It's essentially flat. Sometimes \u2013 we can't speak for what our buying group customers go to get new members. And they sometimes fold in smaller groups, but we're essentially flat. We think our market share might be \u2013 it depends on the different data points you use, but it's maybe stable to up 50 basis points. So we're not seeing anything really significant, except \u2013 the only big thing that happened to us in independents is that we were fairly successful in retaining some of the members of the buying group that we lost last year, and most importantly, we signed a long-term contract with CPA that is our largest buying group customer, and that we think is a leader in innovation and service. So, Tim, anything else?","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, I just go back to what we've said in the past, that our first focus is to \u2013 we're just big believers in prime vendor. That's the foundation. We want to do more with existing customers. That's our focus, to make sure there's no leakage and we get more of that wallet. That's the first focus, get closer and have a win-win for existing customers.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Yeah, one thing I would talk about is the tier within GNP. We're trying to get a lot of our members into the highest tier, where they have a lot of the compliance tools, the integration tools, the tracking tools that we would expect, so that we can have that sort of really comprehensive relationship that we would want with them. So that's really our focus is to make those relationships tighter. But thanks for the question, Eric.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Thanks, Eric. Next question please.","Operator","And it comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. Steve, at the beginning, I apologize \u2013 I kind of missed a little bit \u2013 my phone was cutting in and out. But you were talking about these buying groups, and then \u2013 is it that you were saying that you were \u2013 you anniversaried sort of the new pricing that you're seeing in some of these long-term contracts, or was there still some more as you work with the actual members that that still has to filter through? Just to clarify.","And then in terms of what you were just talking about in terms of your wallet share as a prime vendor, can you talk about how much that's changed over the last year or so, like kind of what kind of share of the wallet are you getting currently? And how much more room do you think there is for improvement? Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Well, I go back to our fiscal year 2016 planning process, and we looked at a small erosion that we'd experienced in the last few years in our GNP share of wallet. And we just \u2013 we said, okay \u2013 I mean, Tim and I sort of challenged Bob Mausch and our team. We said, listen, we're investing in Elevate, we're investing in business coaching, we're investing in First to Shelf. We've got our highest full (1:04:00) rates in PRxO Gen. We don't believe that people \u2013 that our customers should look elsewhere within AmerisourceBergen. And that's really what that has been about. So, CPA, by the way, is very compliant. We have two quarters that we have lapped now on the new contract, so we have another two quarters where we'll be anniversarying that contract. We don't have a lot of big buying group renewals. Most of our buying group customers are under long-term contract that we believe are at market rates. So, we don't have a lot of renewals coming up. And, Tim, I see you want to make a comment here, so...","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No. I think, Steve, you said it well.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Okay.","Tim G. Guttman - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","I think we can go to the next question. Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. So, I think all the pharma questions have been answered. Maybe a little bit on PharMEDium and some of the performance there. You said you'd been thrilled with the integration. Can you just talk a little bit about how you can use that as a potential leading source to drive incremental revenue, incremental customer bases. Has that introduced you to any other new customers that you didn't already know?","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","We can do better there. And in fact I was talking to one of our health systems VPs just this week. I feel we can do better there. It's about a year, and we've had some leadership changes there. I think we're very comfortable with the team. The focus at PharMEDium has really been on making sure that we maintain the high regulatory standards that FDA and others expect of us, and we're working very hard. And I think you'll see ABC and PharMEDium management team having the right orientation there. That's going to be very, very important to continue to lift the standards. So that's been a lot of the focus, and we've been through a lot of the integration.","They have had some benefits from some new product launches. Their pricing there is definitely a different environment than the rest of the generic environment that we see. Their market share is very, very good. They work with 2,000 systems. And their biggest opportunity is really to just do more \u2013 a bigger share of wallet with their customers, but, their pricing is so differentiated than our overall health system GPO customers that we haven't really looked at integrated offerings. And probably shouldn't really, because it's not \u2013 you're sort of mixing apples and oranges. But we are always mindful of, absent the whole Wells Fargo mess, we're always mindful of cross-selling and looking for those synergies with customers. So, appreciate the question on PharMEDium. Thanks.","Barbara A. Brungess - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","Nick, it looks like we have one more person in the queue, so let's take that last question, please.","Operator","Great, we'll go to Greg Bolan with Avondale partners.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Sorry. Hopefully I didn't miss this \u2013 a little late to the call. But, so, it sounds to me that the strategy towards the community pharmacy, independent pharmacy market really hasn't changed a whole lot. Sounds like \u2013 we know that obviously you guys have been trying to kind of steady your position there, reclaim market share over the past several years. And so I just wanted to kind of clarify that. And that's actually all I have. Thanks.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","No, no, well said. I think we've given pretty exhaustive comment on it. I don't ever remember working so carefully on a script just to make sure that you get exactly that message, that ABC is being very thoughtful, very responsive or very planful reacting to an environment that's more challenging. And that's really our message for today. So we appreciate the question. Just \u2013 Barbara, I think I'll make my closing comments now. That was the last question.","Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.","So, thank you for your attention today. I know it's a really busy day. I'm shocked at the calendar. I'm just seeing all the other peer companies that are reporting today, so, I know it's been a very long session. But we wanted to share with you how strongly we feel about the responsibility we have as a leading participant in this segment and how strongly we feel that we're making the right decisions for all the stakeholders, including our investors and including our \u2013 the patients that we ultimately serve, the customers, the manufacturers we supply. And I'm confident that ABC is going to do very well. We're going to find the right areas to capitalize on the incredible capabilities that we have.

Please go ahead.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our second quarter of fiscal 2014. I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President, Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Senior Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2013, as well as our quarterly filings for fiscal 2014. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and cannot -- and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments","Steven H. Collis","Thank you, Barbara, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I am very pleased to report strong performance in our second quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting excellent progress in what is an important transition year for our company, as well as continued execution against our strategic long-term objectives.","AmerisourceBergen associates have driven outstanding operational performance and have carefully managed through challenging working capital dynamics in the first half of our fiscal year. I feel several positive themes came together for us this quarter as we really started to recognize some of the benefits of our strategic imperatives during the quarter.","Specifically, we continue to make excellent progress around our groundbreaking, long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots. We continue to see the scaled enhancements we expected from effectively doubling the number of lines we will service in our core drug wholesale business. This benefits our entire book of business.","Lastly, we are pleased with the progress the Swiss JV has made in negotiations with generic partners. As we have indicated before, contributions from the JV will be an important driver of our future growth goals.","This momentum is driving a lot of creativity and energy at AmerisourceBergen, and is positioning us exceptionally well to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Also notably, our portfolio approach to our business is clearly working as all of our business groups achieved or exceeded the operating plans this quarter.","As the imperatives of health care reform become a reality to payers, patients and stakeholders, we are fortunate to be an integral part of a vibrant and growing industry that is a vital link between the manufacturers of life-saving products and health care practitioners who provide patient care. So the strategic position we occupy is allowing us to capitalize on some important health care fundamentals as the pharmaceutical industry evolves and specialty and generic medicines play an ever-expanding role in pharmaceutical care.","Our diverse book of business, unique insights into manufacturer requirements and how to work in a dynamic regulatory environment, combined with the investments we've made and the partnerships we have developed, position us well to continue to thrive by preserving and extending our influential place in this attractive industry. Moreover, our reputation, partnership philosophy and expanding knowledge of global pharmaceutical markets is settling -- is setting us apart as a preferred partner to assist in developing specialty and manufacturer programs in emerging pharma markets.","In the March quarter, our total revenues were up 39% to $28.5 billion, driven in large part by the substantial new business with Walgreens, as well as strong performance across the rest of our business. Our adjusted earnings per share were $1.06, up a strong 19% over the prior year. In addition, we had tremendous free cash flow in the quarter of $1 billion. We purchased $230 million of our shares in the March quarter and announced a definitive agreement to make $100 million minority investment in Profarma in Brazil. This performance demonstrates both disciplined execution of our financial and operational goals, as well as significant steps towards meeting our strategic objective of expanding our businesses internationally. I am very pleased with the progress we have made on both fronts.","As we continue to expand our global sourcing and distribution services capabilities, I believe that our partnership philosophy sets us apart as we strive for collaborative long-term solutions to pharmaceutical care's biggest challenges. As we have said in the past, when you look at where manufacturer R&D dollars are being focused and you look at the well demonstrated capabilities AmerisourceBergen has, our specialty knowledge and experience makes us an extremely attractive partner to help our stakeholders enhance the efficiency and coverages with which patients access pharmaceutical care throughout the product life cycle. Our tremendous reach across all sites of care and our experience improving patient access to pharmaceuticals gives us a unique advantage as we intentionally focus on expanding our breadth and depth in our chosen market segments.","As we continue to increase our global reach through product sourcing, specialty and niche distribution and other manufacturer services, we will open up new opportunities for AmerisourceBergen, as well as for our customers and manufacturer partners. Our new relationship with Profarma is a great example of this strategy. With its long-term macroeconomic growth outlook, favorable demographics and increasing access to healthcare services and specialty pharmaceuticals, the Brazilian market provides an exciting opportunity to expand our international offerings. Profarma is one of the top 3 wholesalers in Brazil, serving the core distribution and specialty markets and chain and independent retail. Their experience, combined with our expertise in Specialty Distribution and manufacturer services, provides a compelling opportunity to shape the delivery of health care in a new market for ABC. A publicly traded company, Profarma has a solid track record of operational execution and financial growth, and we expect that our minority investment, along with our interest in the specialty JV, will yield important benefits for both companies for many years to come. We look forward to working in partnership with Profarma and expect the transaction to close in our June quarter.","Turning now to the performance of our business segments in the quarter. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment had particularly strong performance. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation revenues were up 46%, driven primarily by the continued onboarding of the new business from Walgreens and strong sales of certain new branded specialty products, largely distributed to specialty pharmacies. Excluding the new Walgreens business, Drug Company revenues were up 7%. In addition to serving Walgreens pharmacies with all of the brand pharmaceuticals they dispense, we have begun to service them with generic drugs as well. The rollout of the distribution of generics to Walgreens is progressing well and on schedule. We expect to complete the process by the end of our fiscal year, assuming we complete our new distribution facility in Orlando late this summer.","In addition, the Walgreens and Alliance Boots JV has made progress in negotiating with generic suppliers, and late in the March quarter, we did begin to recognize some benefit from the joint venture as a result of progress they've made. There's still much work to be done on both the physical distribution of generic products and with the joint venture, but we are pleased with the progress we have made with this important long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens and Alliance Boots.","Importantly, our hospital, health system, and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter, and generic sales were strong in all segments. We don't often discuss our hospital business, but it has been growing above market and is an increasingly important part of our portfolio. Two key drivers in our business with health systems include our expanding ProGenerics sales to hospital customers and also our hospital unit dose program, which runs through American Health Packaging. In addition, our oncology service line is gaining traction as sites of cancer care shift.","Sales to independent drugstores increased over the prior year, and we continue to make progress on new enhancements to our Good Neighbor Pharmacy program, as well as other services for independents. Price inflation on brand products continues to be quite strong and while we expect that a handful of generic products will experience significant price increases, as previously discussed, this usually only impacts a few dozen items a year out of a large catalog of products. We also now forecast that 2 key generic launches we had previously planned for in our fiscal 2014 will be delayed. Overall, like specialty branded products, our generic portfolio contributes significantly to our growth and to the value proposition we bring to the market.","The growth we've experienced across our Drug Company has driven the need for expanded capital investments in our infrastructure. I'm pleased to report that many of the smaller projects are complete and the 2 largest projects, the new distribution center in Orlando and the new national distribution center in Columbus, are both progressing on schedule and on budget.","AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group also had a good quarter, with revenues up 10%, driven by strong performance in ASD and Besse, which offset flat performance in our community oncology business. The community practice we serve continue to face the challenge of inadequate reimbursement for the care they provide. While we continue to support oncologists' efforts to achieve better reimbursement, there's no short-term relief on the horizon. While our community oncology business did meet expectations for the quarter, and overall, is responding well to the challenging environment, we have continued to see some shift in the site of care, which is driving significant growth in the hospital outpatient sales of oncology products. Our differentiated expertise in specialty products and our understanding of manufacturer and patient requirements for these products will continue to help strengthen AmerisourceBergen's overall oncology offering, whether it is in our specialty business specifically, ABCS, or in our core drug business. Our unique expertise and our collaborative approach have helped us deliver tremendous value to providers across the health care spectrum, from independents to the premier drug chain stores to some of the most prestigious hospitals and health systems in the U.S. Overall, our specialty business is what sets ABC apart, and will continue to be a key part of our future value equation.","Turning now to our manufacturer services businesses. Both World Courier and our Consulting business had strong performance in the quarter. World Courier has achieved growth in its existing markets and we continue to be very excited about the opportunities to utilize this platform to further expand both our specialty and manufacturer services offerings into other markets. An added benefit of World Courier has been that it has really enhanced our global capabilities as we essentially learn to operate in 52 new countries. This has added experience and knowledge, not only into our business operations but importantly, into our corporate capabilities. For example, in areas such as treasury, tax, HR and legal\/regulatory. As we evaluate Profarma and other international expansion opportunities, these capabilities will set us apart as we look to create an expanded global presence. So as we come up to almost 2 years that we have owned World Courier, we are so pleased to have added this highly skilled company and its associates to our portfolio.","Our Consulting businesses continue to perform well and to win new business. The unique combination of these service offerings continues to be an important value driver for AmerisourceBergen and continue to be a key driver of our future growth.","As we look ahead to the second half of our fiscal 2014, we are well positioned to meet our objectives for the full year. We now expect our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to be in the range of $3.64 to $3.74, an increase of 13% to 17% over last fiscal year and driven primarily by strong growth in income. Tim will further detail our financial results and expectations, and before I hand it over to him, I just want to highlight a few key items.","While I'm very pleased with the progress we've made thus far, there's much yet work to be done in our fiscal 2014. We will continue onboarding all of the Walgreens distribution business and to partner with the Swiss JV on global generic sourcing. We will also work collaboratively with Walgreens and Alliance Boots to find innovative ways to leverage our existing platforms to the benefit of our current and future suppliers and customers. Our work in developing the next generation of services for independent retail pharmacies is well underway, and we remain driven to help all of our customers realize the benefits of participating in specialty products and services.","As we begin to work with a new partner in Brazil, we will look to expand our specialty third-party logistics and other manufacturer services businesses by further penetrating existing markets and by exploring other opportunities in international markets. Of course, we will be continuing to invest in our core business, which is necessary to improve our ability to operate more efficiently, and also to provide manufacturer customers with a streamlined and differentiated ways to conduct business with us on a global scale. We will help shape health care delivery by leading in customer care through exceptional service and through meeting customer needs amidst the rapidly changing regulatory and operating environments.","As our cash flow normalizes over the remainder of the year, we will deploy capital wisely and with a view to both growing our business and returning funds to shareholders. Our interest in potential acquisitions and other investments, particularly in the specialty and manufacturer services area, continues and extends to opportunities on the international front as well.","Looking further ahead, growing operating margin will be a top priority. While we expect to be able to accomplish that, business mix will continue to be a factor that weighs on our margins. Maximizing the value of our Walgreens and Alliance Boots strategic relationship will also be a high priority. There are many moving parts, including the timing of generic launches in future years, the normal course of business customer renewals, including some of our larger customers and the extent to which health care reform efforts translate into pharmaceutical sales and volume growth.","While it is too early to give specific guidance for fiscal 2015, Tim will provide some color on potential headwinds and tailwinds, and we will provide detailed guidance for fiscal 2015 at our year-end earnings call in the fall.","In conclusion, I am very pleased with the performance we delivered in the first half of our fiscal year and the progress we have made against our priorities for fiscal 2014. Our associates have performed admirably so far this year, and I have great confidence that they will continue to meet the challenges of the marketplace, help us meet our objectives, and thus, ensure a successful future for AmerisourceBergen and all of our stakeholders.","Now here is Tim.","Tim G. Guttman","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we have discussed with investors in the past, we have many moving parts this fiscal year, such as onboarding our new significant partnership account, Walgreens; participating in the Swiss procurement JV; and importantly, managing through a challenging working capital period. We are now at the halfway point of our fiscal year, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress in these 3 key areas.","My remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results from continuing operations. In our press release, we included a reconciling table between GAAP and adjusted results, and we highlight the specific items that we excluded. I will cover 2 of the excluded items: warrants and LIFO, after I recap our adjusted results.","We can begin our Q2 review, starting with the top line. Revenues were $28.5 billion, up about 39% compared to last year. Of the 39% growth, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for virtually all of the overall revenue increase. As Steve mentioned, this was our second full quarter of distributing brand drugs under our Walgreens contract, and this quarter, we also started to distribute generic drugs direct to their stores. Excluding Walgreens, our consolidated revenues would have grown as a percentage in the high single digits.","The December quarter's adjusted gross profit was $832 million, up nearly 17% compared to last year. About 90% of the dollar increase was due to the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, primarily driven by significantly higher unit volumes and associated revenues.","Operating expenses. This quarter, total adjusted operating expenses were $415 million, up about $58 million or about 16%. Consistent with last quarter, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and corporate IT accounted for the majority of the overall dollar expense increase, due in large part to the continued onboarding of the Walgreens business.","Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $416 million, up 17%, and significantly better than the growth we had back in our first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.46%, down 27 basis points compared to last year. We continue to experience high brand drug revenue growth, including the relatively new launch of a branch drug for a chronic disease. These lower margin drugs continue to put some downward pressure on our operating margin, but overall, we are pleased with our margin progression being slightly better than we expected at this point in our fiscal year.","Moving below the operating income line, other income. We did have income related to the sale of a small minority interest in a B2B technology company that we've held for several years. The gain was about $3 million.","Interest expense was slightly higher compared to last year, due to borrowings on our credit facilities, primarily to support the significant Walgreens working capital build we had in late Q4 of last year and early Q1 this year. We are very pleased with -- that we've cycled through the heavy use of our credit facilities in the current March quarter.","Income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 38.2% for the current quarter. We expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be fairly consistent with our current Q2 tax rate. Our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the current March quarter was $1.06, an increase of 19%, driven primarily by the increase in our operating income.","Our adjusted diluted share count was relatively flat to last year's quarter. We have been very effective at offsetting the dilutive impact from employee stock option exercises. Our share repurchases were slightly greater than the 4.5 million of share exercises we've had during the last 4 quarters. And in terms of outstanding shares, we had 227.5 million shares outstanding at March 31.","Let's spend a few minutes discussing our segment results for the current March quarter, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were about $28 billion, up nearly 40% versus last year. As mentioned earlier by Steve, Drug Company led the way with revenues up 46%, due, again to the rollout of the Walgreens contract. However, we also had considerable growth in our alternate site customer segment, up by about 8%. And we saw very good growth in our ProGeneric revenues as a percentage in the mid-teens on a comparable basis. As a reminder, the Walgreens generic business does not run through our Pro business line. Our Pro growth was across all customer segments.","Our Specialty Business Group had a revenue increase of about 10% in the current quarter. Consistent with the last several quarters, we benefited by having a portfolio of companies within our Specialty Group. ASD and Besse Medical led the way in terms of revenue growth. Certain drugs they distribute continue to gain market share, and they've had the benefit of new drugs that have launched. Our Oncology Supply business, which is now about 30% of total specialty revenue, was essentially flat versus last year. The sales growth percentages for the Drug Company and Specialty are before interest segment eliminations, consistent with how we reported these growth rates in the past.","Moving to gross profit. This segment's gross profit was $695 million, up $108 million or 18%. Drug Company was the driver of the majority of the segment gross profit increase, as a result of the positive revenue impacts, especially generics, that I called out previously. And late in the March quarter, we did start to recognize some benefit in gross profit from the procurement joint venture as a result of contracting progress they've made. The Specialty Group had solid gross profit growth, due primarily to their 10% revenue increase. Additionally, Specialty benefited from brand price appreciation in the quarter, some of which was expected in the second half of the year. Also good news, Oncology Supply's gross profit was flat for the quarter as performance stabilized post the sequestration impact. This business continued to benefit from 2 generic oncology drugs introduced in the last year.","Segment operating expenses were $322 million and up 21% from last year. Similar to last quarter, the expense increase is primarily due to supporting the segment's significant volume growth. These infrastructure costs are primarily related to added headcount, delivery costs and depreciation expense at our distribution centers. I think it's important to note that our distribution centers' service levels are benefiting from this greater scale and infrastructure investment. In fact, we ended March at a record level of customer order fulfillment.","Adjusted segment operating income was about $373 million and up 16% versus last year. Again, a large part of the dollar increase was from the Drug Company. Our Specialty Group, even with Oncology Supplies flat, had a strong quarter with operating income growth as a percentage in the low-teens.","Moving to our Other segment. As a reminder, Other is comprised of Consulting Services and World Courier. In the current quarter, segment revenues increased 11% to $573 million. Our World Courier business exceeded our revenue expectations, primarily from expanded relationships with existing customers. This incremental business helped offset seasonality that World Courier has historically experienced in the March quarter. We also continue to see a very good growth rate in our traditional Consulting business, as a percentage in the high single digits, excluding the positive impact from TheraCom, the distribution business within Consulting. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had growth of about $8.7 million or 25% led by World Courier. We continue to leverage the World Courier business platform and this translates to very meaningful margin growth.","That's all I have for our segment review. Let me switch gears and cover our 2 large GAAP items: warrants and LIFO. Warrants. The fair value of the warrants decreased about 20% to approximately $700 million, driven primarily by the decrease in our share price from December 31, compared to the closing price on March 31. Because of this change in fair value, the related inception to date expense is adjusted. This resulted in a very low pretax expense for the current March quarter of just under $6 million.","LIFO. This quarter, we have now revised our LIFO model based on a key assumption. Because of this, we now expect a higher full year LIFO expense as compared to our prior fiscal year. Consequently, we recognized a noncash GAAP expense of approximately $103 million in the current March quarter. We now expect that our overall generic deflation will be less as we will have fewer meaningful generics that are losing their exclusivity this year.","Let's move to our balance sheet and cash flows. We are very pleased with the progress we made in the working capital area and the positive impact on cash. Our March 31 cash balance was about $700 million, much improved from December 31. Our free cash flow was about $1 billion during the quarter, and for the 6 months, we are now essentially flat. Our strong cash flow is primarily the result of 3 items, and all are about equal weighting in terms of impact: one, the March quarter ended on a Monday, which is a very high cash collection day; two, we sold through incremental brand inventory, which is typical to this March quarter after our seasonal build in the December quarter; and three, we benefited by onboarding a significant level of generic inventory as we ramp the Walgreens distribution, combined with increased generic revenues.","As we've communicated in the past, generics have better working capital metrics. Because cash was better than expected, coupled with some volatility in the stock market in the March quarter, we repurchased about $232 million of our shares. We ended the quarter with approximately $840 million available on our share repurchase authorizations.","Now let's turn to fiscal '14 guidance. Since we are at the halfway point of our fiscal year, let me provide some commentary on 2 key guidance metrics. The first metric. As Steve mentioned, we are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to $3.64 to $3.74. We are optimistic about our second half while considering 2 headwinds and a tailwind. The headwinds: one, brand inflation that positively impacted our specialty business will most likely not repeat in the second half, and as mentioned, we pulled some of this forward to the first half; and two, based on new information, the launch of generic Diovan will shift out a quarter, meaning, it's now expected to launch in our September quarter. Additionally, generic Nexium, a significant generic launch, will shift to early fiscal '15. The tailwind, or the positive item we have. We will realize earlier than expected benefits from the procurement JV in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we previously guided that these benefits would start and ramp beginning in our September quarter. To summarize, the revised incremental JV benefit is not enough to offset the 2 headwinds that I called out.","The second guidance metric is free cash flow. We don't expect to realize the same level of increase in our free cash flow in the second half of the year as we did specifically in our March quarter. We are still guiding to free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million for the full year.","Let me provide a quick comment on fiscal '15. It's too early to provide explicit guidance at this point, as we don't have all the information we need, but we thought it would be helpful to frame out fiscal '15. I can start with a few key tailwinds. Our core drug business will realize full year benefits from our Walgreens partnership, which means we expect to be fully ramped for the full 12 months in terms of generic drug distribution. We will also have benefits from the procurement joint venture for the entire year. Fiscal '15 looks to be a good generic launch year, especially now with generic Nexium shifting. And we expect that organic revenue growth will be good as the economy continues to improve and health care reform ramps.","Let me switch and cover a few headwinds. In the ordinary course of business, we have contract renewals each year. In fiscal '15, we have a few key contracts up for renewal, one of which is the Department of Defense. This contract expires at the end of March 2015, and at this point -- and at that point, the contract will be 10 years old. If we are successful with the renewal, we would expect the pricing to be at a significantly lower market-based rate. We also expect that compliance with the new track-and-trace legislation will continue to ramp and negatively impact expenses. And finally, community oncology may continue to be under pressure as practices and patients migrate to the hospital setting due to continued reimbursement pressures. And this may limit the business' ability to offset revenue and margin decline on maturing generic oncology drugs.","As Steve mentioned, we will provide fiscal '15 guidance on our year-end conference call. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects as we look out to fiscal '15 and beyond. That's all I have for prepared comments. In summary, we are very pleased with our progress at the halfway point of our fiscal year, but we recognize we still have plenty of work ahead of us to finish the year. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC.","Now here's Barbara, for Q&A.","Barbara A. Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Tony, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a few follow-up questions. One, on the benefit that you've seen from the JV. Obviously, you were seeing it early on. Can you help maybe quantify for us kind of like what the magnitude that you're -- that you are seeing and whether that you expect the benefit in the second half of the year to be of similar magnitude? Or should we see an increase as you are more kind of like aligning your generic volumes with those of the JV?","Tim G. Guttman","Ricky, this is Tim, and I'll start and Steve can certainly jump in. I mean, we've been very careful about giving that number and we'll continue to do so. It's sensitive information. I think the point that we were trying to make on our call and in our scripts is really to show that we're making progress, the JV continues -- is making progress. That's the important thing here. But we're not at the point where we're going to size that. Again, it's competitively sensitive information.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But should we see a sequential improvement in the second half of the year from the benefit from the JV?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, again, Ricky, I -- we don't want to give any color. We've always said in the past that over time, that the benefit will ramp. So that's -- I think that's -- we'll stay consistent with what we've said in the past.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and one other follow-up, you mentioned 2 things. One, Steve, in your prepared remarks, you talked about generic inflation and you mentioned that you did see a benefit on some select products. Can you just give us the context of how that compares to the trends that you saw last year? And then on the DoD contract, if you can give us any sense of what it is in terms of contribution to the top line.","Steven H. Collis","Yes. So firstly, on the generic price trends, we had a very strong second half of last year on generic price increases. And I think we've guided that this was somewhat exceptional because it was so disproportionate to a few items where -- these weren't increases of 20% to 30%, they were a couple of 100% in some items. And those were really driven, again, by typically manufacturing problems or consolidations or unique circumstances, sometimes the price of these products simply gets too low. And we also -- not only about low costs for our customers and passing those benefits on, as well as achieving portfolio benefits from our generic offering, we're also about quality of supply and consistency and assuredness of supply. So a lot of our customers clearly regard that as a key priority for us and we saw the distortions of injectable shortages for the last few years which, thankfully, have been leveling off. But it still remains an issue. So those are the circumstances where we see big price increases. We also saw big price increases in controlled substances, where there's substantial regulatory burden for monitoring those. So -- and as you step back and don't comment on one particular price increase, the trend makes sense to us, I'd say. Tim, do you have anything to add?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I would just say that, Ricky, generic price appreciation was in line with what we had last year. It wasn't a driver of our Q2 outperformance. And in fact, it was probably down sequentially from Q1. Again, I mean, we gave guidance early in the year that it would moderate and that's kind of where we stand through Q2. So our outperformance this quarter is really driven by good solid top line revenues, generic -- generics pro, pro revenue, good performance across all of our businesses, especially World Courier, good expense management. So I just wanted to make sure I added that. It wasn't the result of brand price appreciation or generic price appreciation -- brand on the oral solids. And then your comment, you had a second question about DoD. I mean, we did say that as of next year, that contract will be 10 years old, we felt that was important to highlight. And in terms of revenue, it's probably in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion for ABC Drug.","Operator","From Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, can you maybe just give us an update, I know you're in the process of onboarding the generic drugs distribution to Walgreens. How quickly do think you can complete that? I don't know if you mentioned that on your prepared remarks. I apologize if I missed that.","Steven H. Collis","So we initially had said that we'd finish it in this calendar year, we've now moved it up a bit to talk about it being done in all probability in our fiscal year. As that would be very helpful, I think, for comp purposes and other reasons. But we don't -- again, we don't have this platform-ish burning, platform-ish because we're doing this very collaboratively with Walgreens. It wasn't like the brand drugs where we had -- the Y2K type, September 1, we had to really move that significant amount of volume over to ABC. So again, as we take these generics over, Walgreens is shutting down some internal distribution capabilities. So we're working in concert and we're very -- we're reasonably confident or highly confident that we'll finish this year. And we've got 3 quarters to do that and it's pretty much tracking to a sequential mathematical type of change, as you would expect.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, maybe, if I could just follow up on Ricky's question regarding the purchasing JV, I think what we're trying to assess with respect to the margins is it kind of seems like as we look out over the next, let's call it, 2 quarters, it seems like we're going to get an incremental contribution from the generics and it sounds like the benefits from the JV seem somewhat gradual in terms of the way they're sort of ramping on. And so taking out the seasonality that we saw in this traditionally strong quarter, should we think about the gross margins, again, excluding that seasonality, sort of ramping over the next couple of quarters?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I guess, Glen, let me answer it this way, I mean, you are right. I mean, there is seasonality in our business this Q2 because of January and brand price appreciation, this is typically our strongest quarter. We see really good margins. What we've communicated in the past is that we do expect margins to improve in Q3 and Q4, really off of Q1. So they'll drop a bit off at Q2 and increase in Q2 -- in 3 and 4, just driven by continued onboarding of that generic business and those are -- that's really the driver.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Steve, maybe if I can squeeze one last one in. You made comments clearly that the margin benefited from some of the brand inflation on the specialty side, but you seem to suggest that, that was going to moderate in the back half of the year. And I'm kind of curious as to why that would be? And related to that, are your purchasing contracts on the specialty side? Are they different from the fee-for-service agreements that you have on the traditional oral solid side? And so is this something that we should think about over the next couple of years as specialty becomes a bigger piece of the total, that brand inflation can really be a sustainable tailwind to the margin? And I'll stop there.","Steven H. Collis","Brand inflation is certainly in the range of our expectations. Specialty, again, they -- in a typical drug distribution center we'll handle 30,000 to 40,000 SKUs, in specialty, it's much narrower and really have disproportionate impact from certain products. So we had one manufacturer in particular that had price increases on their products, that's a semi-exclusive relationship we have in our ASD business unit. So it was a very identifiable benefit which we had expected to be in the second half of the year, which we -- already came early. So that's what's going on there. A little bit, if I can give some internal credit here, with really looking at the business globally under Peyton Howell's leadership on the supply chain agreements, we really are doing global in specialty and drug fee-for-service agreements. And that's been a positive development. So we're looking at that as one ABC and I think that, that's been very helpful. So there's a lot of commonality in agreements while recognizing that sometimes the requirements are different. So our relationships with the manufacturers are very complex, increasingly complex, because of the M&A work that's going on and we really like how complex that -- those relationships are and we are able to benefit from those.","Operator","From the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tim, I wanted to go back to some of the comments you made around '15 in the end of your prepared remarks, thinking about a number of the headwinds and tailwinds that you laid out, and obviously appreciate you letting those out gives us something to work on. But I guess, just at a high level, as you look out today, understanding these things can shift between now and the end of the fiscal year, do you, in fact, see more headwinds than tailwinds or do you see more tailwinds than headwinds on a year-over-year basis, as it stands today as you look out to '15?","Tim G. Guttman","Bob, I mean, we wanted to -- it's a fair question. But I mean, we felt like we needed to frame up '15 and talk about certain ones that face us. I mean, I think, sometimes, investors tend to focus on the incremental positive items. I mean, our purpose today was really to level set and talk about things that happen every day in the ordinary course of business, renewals and to make sure that there's just a better balance, right, between the headwinds and the tailwinds. We called out some of the bigger ones, it's still too early to get really specific. And again, we wrapped up -- I wrapped up my comments saying we're still really optimistic about the growth in '15. But we want to level set everybody that there are some pluses to go along, there are a couple of minuses that go along with the pluses. But again, overall, we expect '15 to be a good solid growth year.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then Steve, just on the hospital setting, I know ProGen program sounded like it grew at the hospital level. So obviously, that sounds like a positive trend. But you also mentioned, again, seeing the shift of oncology therapies from the community sites to the hospital setting. On the shift there, I was wondering if maybe you could touch on just how different the profitability profile is to the company comparing those 2 channels? And then, it feels like this is more of a secular shift at this point? I was wondering if maybe you could share with us your thoughts on where we are today versus where you think this shift between those 2 sites of care ultimately ends up.","Steven H. Collis","Yes, and we've seen all sorts of different models. I mean, sometimes a practice of ours gets acquired by a health system. They really just change their name and it's really a billing-type issue, the practice personnel are all still there. We've also seen practices really get totally integrated into a larger health system. So I wouldn't say all the models are different, a lot [ph] are the same, but what's encouraging in AmerisourceBergen is almost all the large health systems and hospital GPOs we've met with said, \"You've got a lot of expertise in this area, we are bringing more oncologists into our health systems, we want you to carry on giving them the same level of services.\" Then our manufacturer partners have said, \"We recognize this trend, we want to carry on getting some of the services that we're receiving from organizations within AmerisourceBergen, like ION and Lash, so how can you help us?\" So there's a very robust discussion that takes place and I think if you even see some of the pharma areas of consolidation that were announced this week, oncology is just a key focus. So this expertise we have is extraordinarily important, and I think that we are looking at all the channels. The other important channel is specialty pharmacy for all our oncologies and -- or our oncology products. Some of our key partners, like Walgreens, are really focused on this area. So how can we do more specialty care at the retail level? How do we look at MTM benefits? So again, a very robust area and a good illustration of how our innovation and knowledge of the market is driving value for us and our customers.","Operator","From Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, earlier, you commented that, excluding Walgreens, the Drug Company grew, I think you said 7%. That's clearly ahead of what we're seeing in the overall market. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in your book of business? Are you taking market share? Do you have a specific customer segment that's growing particularly faster than the market today?","Steven H. Collis","It was very wide, but again, AmerisourceBergen has a really strong presence in those alternate site markets, which is a very big segment. We have, I think, 16 different subcategories within that segment. And it includes specialty pharmacy and we have very strong -- including -- even excluding our PBM relationship with many fast-growing customers there. And I think that specialty expertise, we talk about it really permeating and creating value throughout all of our businesses and this is clearly a trend. In fact, when our sales team in the Drug Company is out, so many times, they're taking specialty executives in with them, because that acknowledges a true differentiator. And we have just a lot of market share in that alternate site segment, which is very much being driven by specialty sales, branded sales, new therapies. Some of the new therapies we've always pointed to as a potential indicator of growth, and we've seen some very clinically differentiated products that are having an impact on top line growth as well. Tim, anything to add?","Tim G. Guttman","I think, I mean, it's a benefit having a diverse customer base, and some of our larger customers are growing faster. And we called out some of these -- a new launch in particular helped us. So just a combination of things are really driving that above-market performance.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you would say, at this point, you're not really seeing any benefit at all from the Affordable Care Act in that number?","Steven H. Collis","No, not yet at all. No.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then, I guess my second question just would be, Tim, you gave some color around the updated 2014 guidance and some incremental color around headwinds and tailwinds. If I look at this first quarter versus the Street expectations, clearly, you beat the first quarter, but when I look at the individual metrics, you're keeping them pretty much the same. So should the assumption be that the new raised guidance is around the fact that you bought stock in the first quarter and that some of these headwinds and tailwinds aren't going to play out as we go through the next couple of quarters?","Tim G. Guttman","Lisa, I think -- we feel good about where we're at the second half. I mean, clearly, we're a little disappointed on the generics. I called out generic Diovan and Nexium, 2 big ones, important meaningful ones for ABC and -- but again, I guess my point on the -- on -- even though we've been ahead in the first 2 quarters, we still have a long way to go, lots of moving parts. And at this point, we felt like it was prudent to move it up some, the guidance, and we'll just monitor as we move along during the year.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I'm just trying to connect those 2 dots though, because you moved the EPS up, but didn't really change the other metrics, so that was what I was just trying to figure out what was different. Is it...","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. No, I think it's maybe a little bit better performance on revenue, again, kind of within. I'd say, on the revenue, we didn't change our revenue metric, our guidance, but we will probably be on that high end and that's going to benefit us and maybe a little bit on the share repurchase just coming earlier.","Operator","From Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Forgive me if you addressed this on Tim's portion of the prepared remarks, we somehow got dropped off. But on the contracts that you guys are renegotiating now, there was some talk that some of them have been renegotiated. But I'm just trying to figure out, how far along are you guys, just at least directionally, I don't know if you want to take a baseball analogy with what inning you're in or whatever else, and how much of that matters if there could be retroactive pricing? So does it matter if it's September versus June, for example, if it's retroactive to an earlier time period?","Steven H. Collis","We assume you're talking about the generic contract increases, the generic from the Swiss JV? Is that what you're referring to [ph]?","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Exactly, exactly.","Steven H. Collis","Okay.","Tim G. Guttman","Yes, I'd say, Garen, you got cut off, but again, we're going to be consistent. I mean, we wanted to demonstrate that the procurement joint venture is making progress. They are. But we're really -- we're not going to get into any specifics about dollars, retro, when they take effect, how many -- we're again, we view that as competitively sensitive information.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is that at least a -- I mean, is that a linear progression or is that too much to ask?","Tim G. Guttman","Yes. No, we're just not going to -- we're not going to answer that, and again, I'm not trying to be difficult, but again, we've always said that over time, these ramp.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, got it. Okay, and then, the other question is just a little bit more tactical. For this quarter, weather has been an issue on some of the -- some other companies where it's impacted utilization, but obviously, you guys are -- it was above expectation. So I'm just wondering, could you comment a bit as to what you're seeing in same-store utilization trends? And did you guys even see an impact? And what the underlying metric was if you strip that out?","Steven H. Collis","I gave the $28.5 billion in revenue and so we really -- when we do our planning, we really look at growth per customer, we don't really look at scrip trends, but the economy is definitely healthier. I think general acknowledgment that pharmaceutical care is a very efficient form of health care treatment and still only mid-teen level of overall health care spending. But also, just some incredibly impactful new brand drugs that really impacted us late in the quarter, but are significant. So -- and a fairly stable price increase environment, which is a good driver, and the more we go across the world, it's not a driver in other countries. It's again, one of the themes why the U.S. market is such a productive market for our industry.","Operator","From Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, depending on what you read, there seems to be some question as to who will be running the combined Walgreens, Alliance Boots, where it will based and sort of balance sheet and income statement dynamics. Yet your conviction in the joint venture is just unwavering. I mean, what -- where is the confidence coming from?","Steven H. Collis","So Bob, I thought you were going to compliment us on the cash flow, I thought that was the least I was going to get from you, but -- because we were really pleased with how that came out, but...","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It was respectable, yes.","Steven H. Collis","It was respectable, okay. Okay, I'll take it as a big compliment. So I'm not quite sure what to say to your question on who's running it. No, I have great confidence. I speak substantively to Greg, he's a very busy guy, and Wade is -- and Tim, we speak a lot and at all levels, recently, just this week, for example, we had our first big human resource exchange and they bonded well. And then Stefano and Ornella came, they were guests at our management meeting. Peyton interacts regularly with Jeff Berkowitz and John Donovan in Bern who are just so important to our future as they negotiate those generic contracts. So I do remain confident that we have the best partners.

I am Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations, and joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen's President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2014 and other filings. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the company.","As always, those connected by phone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.","Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments.","Steve Collis","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen associates once again delivered strong performance in our third fiscal quarter of 2015. As we reported this morning in our press release our revenues increased 13% to $34.2 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share were up over 19% to $1.2 billion -- a $1.26 and we generated an exceptional $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our results were driven by solid performance across all of our core businesses and include a full quarter impact of MWI Veterinary Supply which is performing better than expected. ","The progress we've made in strengthening our existing platforms and investing in new ones demonstrate our commitments to provide our customers and suppliers with market dealing solutions that enable to collaboratively address the challenges of the fast changing landscape.","We constantly seek to expand our knowledge, reach and partnerships in an effort to drive innovation in both human and animal healthcare services. The quality of our offerings our seamless execution and our disciplined capital management gives us a flexibility to grow our business in ways that help ensure we will generate long-term value from manufacturers at healthcare provider customers, our stakeholders and our other stakeholders for many years to come. ","Our excellent performance through the first nine months of this fiscal 2015 pace us up very well to meet our objectives for the four year. As expected we have began to take some headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2015 and we are beginning to anniversary many of the significant benefit of our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreen Boots Alliance. However organic growth rate remains strong. Literally is growing fast in our overall markets and I feel our excellent portfolio of leading pharmaceutical services companies positions us extremely well to continue to take advantage of opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical supply channel. Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the June quarter.","Holding on the exceptional momentum we had in the first half of the year our performance in the third quarter was very solid. Strong revenue and gross profit growth drove excellent adjusted earnings per share growth and continuing improvement in working capital terms lead to very strong cash flow. Tim will provide further details but I want to call out some highlights from our business units.","AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a good quarter with revenues up [indiscernible] even as we continue to anniversary the on boarding of the Walgreens business. Solid organic growth and strong brand drug pricing contributed to ABDC's revenue growth; while generic drug inflation is slightly increased. Generic sales are strong across all of ABDC's customer segments.","We are very pleased that our good neighbor pharmacies chain, health systems and alternate site customers all performed well in the quarter. Next week we'll be hosting our annual trade show for our independent pharmacy customers in Las Vegas and we're looking forward to presenting our health offerings and new programs to this important customer segment. ","I have never been more excited about the opportunities that exist for ABC's partner with pharmacies to impact the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. We have invested in several new initiatives that will enable us to offer independent pharmacies a set of enhanced capabilities that will support their efforts to improve patient care and to receive fair and accurate payments from payers with a new level of transparency. ","We're proud to be the advocate for community pharmacies that increasingly provide some of the most important cache points to ensure patients have access to medications and to other aspects of care. And you'll be hearing more about how we'll further empower the efforts and evolve our GNP network over the next few weeks. ","We're also very active with regulators and legislators both independently and through our trade associations to expertly advise and inform those important constituents on pertinent issues for our industry and our customers. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made in our long-term strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This unique industry tracking relationship has been both strategically and operationally important to ABC.","Significantly as a customer, we continue to enjoy a wide market growth on WBA this quarter. While we've almost for the anniversary the onboarding of the distribution business we are not finished growing the relationship and we are both focused on exploring additional way to create new value points through WBAD and other share opportunities.","As our retail business is growing substantially over the last two years we both had strong performance in our health systems and all [indiscernible] segments. During the quarter we were very pleased to receive acute distributor of the year in the Mark McKenna Supplier of the Year Award from Novation which is been a valued partner for many years. I believe this recognition from Novation in a year of tremendous change for AmerisourceBergen highlights the tireless efforts our associates make every day to ensure that all of our customers are well served.","AmerisourceBergen specialty group had impressive results in the quarter with a number of different factors driving strong sales. Setting aside the impact of some previously reported manufacturing post changes on certain oncology products which moved some revenues from Drug Company into specialty. ABSG revenues were up 13%. Apposition distribution business ASD and our community oncology businesses all performed very well in the quarter. While reimbursement issues with ASP drugs persist the market leadership and credibility the specialty company and their leaders enjoy is a continual source of pride and differentiation from AmerisourceBergen. ","I worked with many of these leaders and associates. Where in some cases [indiscernible] decades and they are always passionate, constantly innovative and importantly remain very customer centered. Their performance this year has been especially strong and positions us well to continue to drive and be the leader in the specialty arena. ","The decades we have spent broadly developing our portfolio of specialty offerings and bolting up the capabilities and expertise in the industry to handle complex product and services have enabled us to play a leading role in dealing with products for special needs. ","Our capabilities excel, extend well beyond sophisticated logistics and into the distinct requirements for the specific disease states and unique classes of products. The combination of services and expertise we offer helps those manufacturers and healthcare providers manage the opportunities and challenges of this most dynamic segment of the market. Whether we are dealing with a new branded chemical or biologic product, a generic version or a mature therapy or a product in growth areas such as biosimilars, AmerisourceBergen has the expertise required to help ensure product success across the entire lifecycle of the drug. As health reform and other economic realities bring even more focus on the specialty products segments.","AmerisourceBergen is best positioned to help our partners maximize the benefits of advanced specialty products. Regarding biosimilars specifically, we continue to believe that their introduction to US market will give us a tremendous opportunity to further develop us demonstrate our strength in these areas. But we are not certain on the timing of specific product launches. While we remain excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to this new type of products majority of the benefits from biosimilars are so likely a way forward. ","Of course our collaborative efforts are no longer confined to the US. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made as we have expanded our international presence while improving the services we offer our manufacturer and provider customers of our Bluepoint private label program and ABC swift are progressing well and are demonstrators of the innovative services and solutions we will continue to develop in the years ahead.","In addition we are pleased with the progress we have made with our specialty joint venture in Brazil. In the US we continue to add new manufacturers to our programs running through our national distribution center in Columbus. Wholesalers have never been more important to the pharmaceutical supply channel, as we move through a wave of customer and supplier consolidation and the healthcare landscape continues to evolve with the rapid pace there is great opportunity for our industry and for AmerisourceBergen in particular to demonstrate the full value we can provide.","Let's turn now to the other segments. As I mentioned earlier, this was the first time we had a full quarter of MWI in our results and we are very pleased with their performance. We\u2019ve made excellent progress on the integration and on the identification of synergies I am very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance and will make important contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we expand our efforts into animal health. We continue to believe we acquired a first rate company and organization with MWI.","[Indiscernible] are the acknowledged leaders in this field and are enthusiastic about the way they can further enhance the offering with the expanded opportunity under the ABC umbrella. Their willingness to embrace and implement new ideas and their commitment to both outstanding execution and customer service bodes well for the future of their business and the role that they will play as part of ABC. Our manufacture services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas is a differentiator today.","Our increasingly global reach our manufacture services businesses further expand our value proposition to manufacturers as we look to expand our ability to also fully cadence global clinical and consulting solutions or virtually any specialty products launched in the developed world. These are great times to the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. Organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market are being driven by better economic conditions, health reform initiatives, exceptional launch of the new brand products and population demographics. Advances in veterinary medicine have improved the quality of life in of companion animals and given pet owners far more choices in maintaining their health. In addition increasing global demand for proteins drives the production side of the market and creates opportunities to extend the expertise MWI has gone in the US into developing global markets.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2015, we again expect the strong trends in overall market growth to continue while trends in certain specific areas will moderate. Tim will provide more detail but given these trends and our performance in the June quarter we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year to 492 to 497 which represent outstanding growth of 24% to 25% over last year. As we look further ahead to fiscal 2016 it is too early to give detailed guidance but we can see a path to earnings per share growth in the low teens. We are still working through our in depth planning process but there are few headwinds and tailwinds that we think you should bear in mind as you think about our growth rate for fiscal 2016.","First the tailwinds, continued solid organic revenue growth and brand growth inflation; secondly, better generic launches and five incremental management benefits from MWI acquisition. The headwinds are; significant impact from DoD contract repricing in the first half of the year. As a customer we also anticipate in fiscal 2016 includes [indiscernible] late in the fiscal year and declining contribution from generic inflation. There are few additional functions to concentrate as you think about fiscal 2016. We assume no valuation for [indiscernible] exercises because we have the 2016 warrants 100% hedged. We expect to repurchase $300 million in shares under our normal program. No contribution from M&A is planned in 2016 and no meaningful contribution from biosimilars in 2016. We remain hopeful that biosimilars are a great opportunity for ABC particularly for the physician administered products. But it\u2019s too difficult to predict the timing of any launches at this time. However, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong I want to reiterate that these are preliminary thoughts and that we will give our detailed guidance when we report our fourth quarter in the fall. ","Before I turn it over to Tim I want to commend our ADC associates for delivering stellar performance through nine months of fiscal 2015. Over the last few years we've challenged our people to develop our talent in new leadership areas, both with our existing associates and by recruiting high quality individuals externally in order to ensure that we can grow our business by remaining the partner of choice in the pharmaceutical supply channel. The value creation we generate is the result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas.","Our associates share my conviction as we make vital contributions to the health and well being of humans and animals. And by extending in that growth we can continue to provide excellent returns to our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now here is Tim. ","Tim Guttman","Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Consistent with past quarters my remarks will focus primarily on our adjusted results. Let me point out that all financial comparisons are for our third fiscal quarter ended June 30th 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. I have three topics to cover this morning. First I'll recap consolidated and segment P&L performance. I'll also cover few consolidated cash flow highlights. Second topic; I'll briefly recap our large hedging progress to date and my third topic I'll wrap up with comments about guidance for fiscal year '15 and also provide some preliminary thoughts in fiscal '16. ","So with that we can begin our Q3 review. Revenues increased $3.9 billion to $34.2 billion, up 13%. On an overall basis sales to Walgreen stores accounted for roughly 50% up our revenue dollar increase, as a reminder this is now our third quarter of having this key customers business in all their brand and generic volumes for the entire quarter consequently a majority of their growth continues to be related to year-over-year business ramping.","Additionally, MWI contributed roughly 20% of our overall revenue dollar growth. The quarters adjusted gross profit increased $184 million or 22%, to just over $1 billion. About 70% of the dollar growth came from our other segment. Primarily as result of adding a full quarter of MWI's results. The remaining dollar growth was from our pharmaceutical distribution segments driven primarily by revenue growth.","Operating expenses, our total adjusted operating expense increased about $122 million or 28%, to approximately $551 million consistent with a change in gross profit dollars and I've just covered the other segment drove about 70% of the dollar growth again primarily due to MWI.","Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $455 million, up about $52 million for a very strong 16% growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, up three basis points, due to adding MWI as they have a higher margin profile than our core drug businesses. Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $28 million and roughly half of the quarterly expense was related to the MWI acquisition financing. ","Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 35.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize the decrease in our cash rates due to income growth in our international businesses. Additionally this quarter, we realized about a 40 basis points improvement in our tax rates related to the filing of our 2014 tax return and recognizing a favorable cash provision to return adjustment. ","For the full year we now expect our cash rate to be between 36% and 36.5%. For the quarter our adjusted diluted EPS increased 19% to $1.20, driven by organic operating income growth, the addition of MWI and the benefit of a lower consolidate cash rates. Our adjusted diluted share count at 231.3 million shares was essentially flat to last year's quarter. ","Let's move forward and discuss our segment result starting with pharmaceutical distributions. Total segment revenues were about $32.8 billion up 10%, as mentioned earlier by key Drug Company head growth in revenues of 9% driven by two items. The first item; market growth continues to be good, driven by volume and strong pricing especially in the brand drug side. I should note that sales of hepatitis C drugs did not contribute meaningfully to the overall revenue growth in our Drug Company. And the second item; we have an anniversary of full implementation of the Walgreens contract yet, so we continue to realize a revenue benefits here also. ","In terms of mix, Drug Company totaled generic revenues increased year-over-year, just over 20% in dollars. Most of it increased is the result of service in Walgreens fully this quarter while last year in the June '14 quarter we're servicing about 70% of their locations of brands and generics. ","Our specialty business group had overall revenue increased to 22%, similar to the past few quarters, adjusting for the shift in certain oncology revenues from our drug company to our specialty business, our specialty business grew an impressive 13% from higher volumes, a good pricing environment and new brand drug introductions. Specialty growth came primarily from sales of oncology and ophthalmology drugs from our large businesses, ASD oncology supply and specialty medical. This is the fourth quarter in a row with solid revenue growth in oncology supply our business that focuses on serving community oncology. These sales growth percentages for drug company and specialty that I just provided are before intra-segment elimination consistent with how we have reported these growth rates in past quarter.","Moving to gross profit, the segment\u2019s gross profit was $746 million up about 8% we saw a very good gross profit growth in our specialty business due to higher revenue growth. Our drug company had solid gross profit growth from higher revenues but as discussed in the past these contributions were negatively impacted by two items, one that started the Department of Defense contract that we renewed at a margin in line with markets and two we had fewer generic drug price increases in the quarter and our total dollar contribution for the generic inflation was down somewhat sequentially for the March quarter and meaningfully compared to last year\u2019s quarter.","Segment operating expenses were $368 million and were up about 11% this increase is primarily related to payroll, delivery cost, depreciation and IT cost to support the segment\u2019s large volume growth and operational complexity. Additionally we continue to ramp our national distribution center in Ohio and our Switzerland business both are performing well but are not yet fully optimized. Finally operating expense also include the additional incentive compensation accruals related to the strong year-to-date performance of the two business groups in this segment. Segment operating income was $378 million and up about 5%, our specialty business group had good growth this quarter offset by lower growth in our core drug business, due to the items I just highlighted.","We can now move to our other segments, which include consulting services, world courier and MWI. In the quarter total segment revenues were $1.5 billion up significantly due to the addition of MWI on a comparable basis excluding MWI the revenue growth would have been as a percentage in the mid teens with a majority of the revenue growth coming from our fair comp distribution business and the remainder from our core consulting business including Canada. MWI had a very good revenue quarter as a result of strong companion animal revenues. On a comparable basis the last year the consolidated revenues increased in the high single digits as a percentage as a result of increased volumes, new product introductions and a solid pricing environment.","From an operating income standpoint, we had significant increase of $44 million to total operating income of $77 million. The segment benefited from having MWI included in the quarterly results. In terms of MWI we are pleased with our overall operating margin as a result of higher companion animal revenues and we are tracking right on schedule in terms of integrating the business and capturing synergies. Finally we\u2019re also very pleased with both consulting and world courier we had solid income growth in the June growth as a result of better than expected revenues.","This completes our segment review so let me switch and cover our two large GAAP items warrants and LIFO. Warrants, the fair value of warrants decreased to $2.4 billion as of June 30th, this decrease in value was due primarily to the 6% decrease in the ABC share price from March 31st to June 30th. This decrease in the ABC share price also drove a GAAP P&L credit of $15 million for the quarter. LIFO this quarter we recorded an expense of $159 million our full year LIFO estimate is now revised at $602 million, this represents an increase of $254 million versus the prior year. The increase is due primarily to an expected higher annualized brand inflation rate now estimated to be in the mid teens and also a slightly higher inventory balance through the overall business growth.","This wraps up our P&L review. Let me switch and cover cash and capital deployments. This quarter we had excellent free cash flow of nearly $1.1 billion, a record quarter for ABC, as I highlighted earlier a significant increase in generic revenues for last two quarters and the benefits of scale help to drive our improved working capital metrics. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.6 billion which is very good considering we paid down $250 million on our term loan we also repurchased about $112 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program bringing our year-to-date total under this program to $260 million. We also continued to make steady progress under our special share repurchase program. As you remember this program is designed to cover our hedging. This quarter we purchased 1.2 million shares for about $133 million. We also exercised half of the call options that we executed back in March 2015 meaning we purchased 3 million shares for $287 million. This quarter we included a table in this morning's earnings release that covers a large hedging progress and as said you refer to the table to the details on our coverage. We are pleased that we are now 100% hedged against our 2016 warrant, meaning to our investors that we'll avoid adjusted EPS dilutions upon the first warrant exercise.","As we go forward we expect to deploy the appropriate capital to remain 100% hedged. Offsetting the remaining potential warrant solution on the 2017 warrant remains a top priority as we thoughtfully consider our capital deployment.","Let's move to our third and final topic this morning, our guidance. And first one; we'll provide updated guidance for fiscal '15 and few key areas. Adjusted EPS we expect our fiscal '15 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $4.97 which reflects growth in 24% to 25% last year's adjusted EPS. ","Share repurchases, our guidance for regular share repurchases increases to $300 million for the full year and wrapping up with free cash flow, we now expect to be into the $3 billion range for the full year driven primarily by a much improved generic revenue mix.","Let me switch and provide a few additional details followed by key commentary on fiscal '16. One based on trends including activity in July to date. We continue to see the slowdown in generic drug price inflation as a result of fewer drugs having price increases in addition to generic price increases being more modest in comparison to recent history. Consequently we have changed our view this area and we are now expecting that the associated income contribution in fiscal '16 will be lower. ","Two, our working assumption is that operating income and adjusted EPS growth will be higher in the second half of fiscal '16 given that we still have significant Department of Defense contract headwind at first two quarters of fiscal '16. Also these first two quarters we'll have tougher comparable related to generic price depreciation. And three, our free cash flow is benefiting in fiscal '15 due to the one time ramping of the Walgreen's generic business which also gives us significant scale. We expect to see some moderation in cash flow area in fiscal '16.","As I wrap-up my prepared comments, I want to thank you for your time and your attention this morning, we are in the home stretch of fiscal '15 and we're very pleased with the progress we made to date. We'll provide specific fiscal '16 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in late October. Thank you for your interest in ABC and now here's Barbara to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Barbara Brungess","Thank you, Tim. We'll now open the call to question. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many callers as possible. Please go ahead [Tom].","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question's from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks and good morning. Tim, I appreciate all the guidance that you just gave on the cash flow. My first question was really around you know your free cash flow guidance now is 2.8 billion to 3.2 billion and just kind of looking at last quarter's press release it was only 2 billion to 2.3 billion. So, could give us a sense or maybe what changed in the last 90 days and maybe you know when you think about your new cash flow expectations. Could you give us a sense or maybe how much might be a one time working capital benefit so we can think about more and more normalized will help us model more normalized cash flow in fiscal '16?","Steve Collis","Yes Glen. Yeah, we've been -- cash flow has been super this year. It's gone up, I would say that we've been pleasantly surprised by just a mix and higher generic again last quarter and in to this quarter. There's always a little bit of a lag on cash flow with the way we pay invoices, I think the other, we've done very well managing inventory level through the summer that\u2019s certainly has helped us. So it's been a good story for ABC in terms of next year we'll have a moderation. We did have a onetime benefit this year, earlier in the year and reducing inventory. But I think at this point still lot of moving parts and we're seeing for '16 we'll see a moderation but I don\u2019t think we really want to quantify yet, still trying to finish up our planning process.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. That\u2019s fine. Maybe I just ask one follow-up on your initial fiscal '16 commentary. It seems like you only included the $300 million of capital deployment. I'm guessing that from the share repo to offset some anticipated dilution. At this point, if you don\u2019t buy anything or buyback more of your stock you will be net cash flow positive and I don\u2019t you going to do that. So just really a question of you not sure how you are going to deploy the capital but I'm assuming that\u2019s going be a reasonable part of the growth over the next 12 to 18 months.","Tim Guttman","Yes, I\u2019ll start Glen and Steve can certainly jump in but we have tremendous financial flexibility we\u2019re in good position here. We started off in our guidance with a number of -- it\u2019s closer this year and I think our investors know that we\u2019re a very prudent and thoughtful if we have opportunities to deploy capital and buyback shares at a good price. We will assuming we don\u2019t have other value creation ideas out there like M&A, so certainly smart M&A comes first but given the opportunity we\u2019ll look at share repurchases.","Steve Collis","We don\u2019t have anything that we sample as I said in my prepared comments but we\u2019re very active and certainly if we can find you know another MWI health business or World Courier or a TheraCom which are the three acquisitions we made in the last couple of years that are great strategic and operational benefits to our company and with the very strong culture if you look back I just reflecting on this in my remarks when I prepared my remarks you know oncology supplies almost 20 years ago since we reported and that was $7 million and it\u2019s pretty remarkable and then two years after that with eye on [indiscernible] safety we started ASD, RTS and we acquired [indiscernible] it is not only the contributions from those businesses it\u2019s a contribution from the people that we brought in.","So and now we see that\u2019s with some of the people we brought in from World Courier and MWI as well which is a larger organization. So bringing in the right mix of culture, people there are can associate with the core business that\u2019s really a key that differentiates AmerisourceBergen we have great home with people who want to stay with the organization and grow their business. So I think that\u2019s one of the things that we're very thoughtful of along with the attributes of the business but as an act of common M&A and we certainly participating in things [indiscernible].","Tim Guttman","And I guess Glen, just to remind everyone we\u2019re still planning to balance right between we still have hedging, we still have about two years to go maybe on the second warrant most likely to March of 17th we have to balance purchasing shares to offset that potentially and also the regular share program. So, so far walked a while and be opportunistic in both areas. ","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Glen. Next question please.","Operator","Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby","Can you give us a sense on MWI maybe what portion of the growth that you\u2019re pointing to was more from the industry and what may have been share gains? And can you also mention pricing, is that across the board strategy by you to raise pricing or is that just simply passing on to manufactured bumps in the latest period?","Tim Guttman","Bob, this is Tim. No it's certainly the latter, it's a good pricing for manufacturers that we\u2019re able to pass through and there is a benefit [indiscernible] on the drug side. And we\u2019re particularly strong in the companion animal segment and we think a lot of that is demographics there is a couple of new products some of the things that we talked about for ADC are definitely true for MWI, their private label programs are strong, their generic growth is very strong. We\u2019ve had a little bit below expected on the production side but we have a very strong offering there and there is some changes in the market, we still have some integration work going on our acquisitions of MWI completed which will drive some SG&A benefit. So we could not be more thrilled with how things are going and the group has just fitted in tremendously to ABC and is a great illustration of what I said about how important the culture is and acquisitions we make particularly like one for MWI.","Robert Willoughby","So just to be clear on the companion side, you are then really just kind of growing with the industry or are you pulling share from anybody there?","Tim Guttman","I think it might just be one or two percent I think the market is just growing, I mean we did the acquisition, we modeled global growth around 8% and the data is not quite as good as we have on the human side, but it\u2019s good enough and certainly I don\u2019t think we picked up after market share I think there is a very healthy growing market.","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Bob. Next question please.","Operator","Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","So, just kind of slightly couple of questions here, so first of all on generic inflation can you just give us a little bit more color, if you kind of like look at the type of drugs and how they behave, drugs that went up in price last year did they go up in price again or did they just make some and increases that you saw this quarter did they represent kind of increases from new drugs that you haven\u2019t seen pricing action on before? So that was question one. And then the second part of my question is around just kind of like organic top line growth that you\u2019re seeing on the distribution segment I know that you said it like about half of the growth is coming from Walgreens. But I mean there is also kind of [indiscernible] so how should we kind of like there're lot of moving parts. So how should we think about kind of that just the top line kind of like growth if we can think about it, go for the run rate. ","Steve Collis","Yes. We give a range of earnings for the year because generic price increases have been particularly, quarterly sensitive and even may vary between us and our competitors. One thing we point on that we haven't see major increases in any one product, you know very large increases, but definitely moderate to the last quarter of order between second and third quarter and we seen that also for the fourth quarter. So our outlook has moderated a bit, hey Tim you want to just add any.","Tim Guttman","Yes. I would say, Ricky on the revenue question we did call out the drug had a 9% revenue growth and clearly -- maybe a small part but half of that is Walgreen's -- but again there are, to your point there are moving parts, maybe probably lots of percent or so on and for America as a headwind and we also had [indiscernible] which is a very large brand drug that converted during the quarter as a a little bit of a headwind. So those moving part, we thought so far 4% plus. It's still pretty good concerning a couple of the headwinds out there.","RickyGoldwasser","Okay. And when we think about kind of like the EBIT growth on any distribution EBIT growth worth about kind of 5%. So is this kind of reflection of the WBA business representing half of the book and once you kind of anniversary that we should see kind of like EBIT growth nearing the top line?","Steve Collis","Well in pharmaceutical distribution add a mix to specialty business and growth. You know just it's really tracks very well, our larger customers are probably growing faster than overall market so. You got lots of different mix issues, but overall as you point out a solid operating income growth of about 5% in pharmaceutical distribution.","Tim Guttman","Again a little bit lower because of some of the headwinds that we called out, the generic price depreciation being lower the Department of Defense. The drug company also postponed a couple of contracts and [indiscernible] for the '16 and the '15. I guess that book of business to cure itself. We still feel pretty good about the growth rate and net income in that segment going into '16. ","RickyGoldwasser","Okay Thank you.","Operator","Question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones ","Thanks for the questions. Actually I just want to ask on guidance for fiscal '16 and the potential swing factors, special relative to the last two years. You guys have beat your initial guidance for last couple of years by -- an average about 10%, obviously a large part because as Walgreens and related benefits. I'm just curious as you think about fiscal '16? Are there big swing factors that you see out there? That could drive that potential kind of upside that we seen you guys put forth the last two fiscal years relative to initial guidance.","Steve Collis","I guess, well thanks for the question. I guess that we had in our extra quality out there and maybe it's the new traditional growth but from what we understand about how they would be accessed in market base. As it doesn\u2019t look like they'll sort out right away in a multi-million dollar drugs if it is in at-risk biosimilar launch in physician administered products. Certainly first five [indiscernible] that we expect to come to market is not a big enough product to really cause a couple of [indiscernible]. We've got a lot of stuff with a lower hanging fruits out of our businesses like say World Courier in particular we after the first year we had some opportunities to really restructure the business and add some opportunity. ","We continue to work on WBAD opportunities and I think one of the things we do just into -- if you think of it as a static model, we meet constantly with our counterparts at WBAD and we have the group in Berlin, they exchange a lot of ideas and so I think that is definitely an opportunity. And we continue to be very optimistic about our global growth prospects. We had a little bit of a rough start in Brazil particularly on the currency side but the specialty JV's doing well. Our thesis that we can add value to a company that has some presence in specialty distribution in Brazil was the market that we choose to really invest behind -- it is definitely we think bearing fruit and we helping the JV get more access to manufacturers products which is frankly more of a product problem than you've realized. We take for granted here, that ASD and a bit oncology supply that have access to all the manufactures so far in [indiscernible] segments. That is not being the case there so we worked hard and we being successful at that and getting the people right is different and also we learning a lot and those will be opportunities for us. But I think the revenue growth beyond what we expect early renewals on some customers as rates may be better than we expected but nothing beyond that I can think of -- I'm really -portraying to anything I think of. Tim.","Tim Guttman","I would just echo what Steve said and again we've been very fortunate we worked hard we've beaten the initial numbers we put out but we also had a unique and extraordinary business relationship with Walgreen. Lots of variables you know moving parts, timing so that added complexity and that all worked out, it worked out really well better than we ever expected. And of course generic price appreciation externally was a big factor on helping us too. So you create your own kind of destiny here we\u2019re working hard and I think some of the others that Steve mentioned that we\u2019re optimistic that sales will come to fruition and help us out.","Robert Jones ","And I guess Tim just if I could get one clarification question on the comment you made on generic inflation. I am just trying to get a sense of are you still assuming an inflationary environment in fiscal \u201916 and if so just any order of magnitude relative to what we\u2019ve experienced in this past year would be helpful.","Tim Guttman","Good question I mean definitely we definitely are assuming an inflationary environment, we still expect to have a contribution from generic price increases we\u2019re just saying it\u2019s going to moderate and just in pure dollars it\u2019d be less so be a little bit of a headwind for us in '16. ","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Bob. Next question please.","Operator","Garen Sarafian, Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian","So just to clarify some of the other responses that you\u2019ve made, so the commentary of low double digit growth rate for fiscal \u201916 does not include biosimilar, meaningful contribution from biosimilars and also it does include a meaningful slowdown in generic inflation, correct?","Steve Collis","That would be true, but meaningful again we haven\u2019t really thought of it yet, we just thought of doing corporate reviews of plan and we\u2019re doing the business units in the next few weeks. And we\u2019ll get a better read on how we feel about generic price increases after we see what some of the trends in the fourth quarter are, which help us understand what Q1 and Q2 could look like. So, Steve just tried to jump in I mean we did say and I guess we should be very clear because I said no meaningful contribution from biosimilar and just declining contribution from generic inflation.","Garen Sarafian","And then just switching gears little bit, I think you\u2019re having your good neighbor pharmacy trade show again in the couple of weeks. So as you compete against your peers independent could you talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re improving your programs to gain more independence and maybe the key messages that you\u2019re trying to get out to the independent so that you can stay ahead?","Steve Collis","It\u2019s a great question, and this is an area I think our industry as a whole has been at the best friend that community pharmacy has and some of the programs and services that we offer really do enable us to complete in a more challenging industry so also with opportunities there a 82% of the scripts being generics with some of the specialty products like the new [indiscernible] and traditional growth being in community so there are going to be opportunities for them to access patients. We\u2019re also working very hard on the regulatory front. But we\u2019ve done a lot of work and we have Bob Marsh as leader of our drug company who really comes from an analytics and self consultative background. And we\u2019re doing a lot of work to understand exactly what our customers value and what they want to help with this is reimbursements, making sure that they get everything that they\u2019re entitled to, the mergers out in front.","Our family works for the Good Neighbor Pharmacy here in area in Philadelphia we live and I was actually there yesterday because we did some transformation there. And I tell you, I was taking to a patient there Medicare patient and he was just saying, he was saying this is the guy who brought the people in, he's the guy who brought the people in to help make this store look like a [indiscernible] she just about gave me a hug and said thank you, I mean it\u2019s just real fantastic and the pharmacies taking in already know how to take care of my patients on how to run backend of the store and lot of merchandise, I don\u2019t do the front end of the store that well and you guys have helped make it look very professional, very bright, organized it. For example they never had a power station before. So we have the whole American Greenhornets coming in they've got a whole station there and you can really like and they have it. We never had a [indiscernible] before with anniversary, like a birth date so all that is there now and we did that all for the pharmacy so just a very fragmented illustration of the sort of the things that we do and our industry does it and it\u2019s very-very value creating and hopefully engenders a lot of a loyalty from our customers.","And then we have the tools we also recently for example the inside tenant we\u2019ve shown what that has meant to his practice as he is able to track our scripts or manage from a 30 days or 90 days script to pick, very-very interesting and last we had in D.C. and one of the things that we do is and I've said that to you before on these calls the reason that is thank us for being a good advocate for our customers is helping share their issues. No other companies large companies come here and talk about the customers as much as you do. So I think we tried very hard I think our customers appreciate it, our tenant next week will be up 15% so we\u2019re looking forward to actually some, it will be a very significant increase in the level of services and offerings that we have with Dave Hugh taking fulltime over the Good Neighbor Pharmacy position. I think you're going to see a whole lot of innovation and new ideas and new services, what we called a next level of Good Neighbor Pharmacy Services, so thanks for the question. We're excited as you can tell, I probably took too long to answer that question but I'm very excited about what we're going to be doing in this area.","GarenSarafian","Got it. Great thank you.","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Garen. Next question please.","Operator","Lisa Gill, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill ","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Steven in your prepared comments you talked about consolidation and the impact on the industry. Can you maybe just give more color as to how you're thinking about it or you talking about specifically generic manufactures that are potentially consolidating and what that will mean for the industry or were you talking about the managed care consolidation and the impact on the industry?","Steve Collis","Yeah. Thanks Lisa. That\u2019s a great question. You know and our board asked this question a lot and in last month Barbara and Tim and I were in London we got a lot of these questions because we were [indiscernible] the timing, of course to manage the consolidation so I think first of all consolidation awaited us simplified number of parties to talk to you and work on programs. There is no doubt that we are in the midst post -- the Affordable Care Act implementation of significant change in our industry and it's important for large companies like AmerisourceBergen to participate and give voice to the smaller customers and we think about oncologists, we think about independent long term care providers, we think about community pharmacists, and w think about also working with trade association in a more larger customers like our PDM customer, and our large chain customers to make sure that their issues get voiced. But in short I think the scale and efficiency that we continue to provide will always be [indiscernible] not a surprised that\u2019s what we've done for [indiscernible]. The services that we provide need to be more thoughtful and provide new efficiencies to the customers, that\u2019s why comments about the talent that we have in knowledge of the market and the role of the wholesalers that we made I think are all very permanent. You know what, just one thing that I think is worth mentioning, a lot of workers on [indiscernible] and contracting on pharmacy items. It is post our belief and so it happens on the back end side, often negotiations between PDMs and manufactures directly, they don\u2019t impact our economics directly but I'd say that we all in a same ecosystem and that ultimately does have an impact on description and pharmaceutical supplies. ","Just last comment in maybe -- it is a big question. You know on the generic side we've been through these massive merges, you look at all the work in elegance done and others how sales have grown over the years. We're confident that the value that we provide to generic manufactures will sustain through any combinations and that's also was true for brand manufactures and harboring models as well.","Lisa Gill ","I'm sorry. I was going to actually ask you a follow-up around that. When you think about inflation. How much visibility do you have [indiscernible] thinking about '16 right now. Are you just looking at the trends, here's what we're seeing now and this is what we know best in the market, so we're going to conservatively say on '16 we expect that trend to continue or do you have any kind of visibility based on your relationships with the manufactures that you have an idea of what potentially price inflation could be six or nine months from now which would actually impact '16?","Steve Collis","Lisa. Interesting question. I mean, yes it's clearly the fact that we're looking at trends. Trends over the last 90 to 120 days, our [indiscernible] group track the drugs and changes, but we do not have any visibility into the forward thinking of manufactures and we're like everybody else, we're kind of notified early before. So again our thinking is based on what we're seeing and projecting that out.","Lisa Gill ","Okay that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Barbara Brungess","Thanks Lisa. Given that we're approaching the top of the hour. We'll take one more question.","Operator","Well go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Thank you. So this is the second quarter that you've called out brand inflation and the number of the life service quite a bit higher than I expected. It's been hard to flush out what's going on with brand inflation given the Hep C elements. How long do you believe that we've seen our expansion of brand inflation? And are you seeing it both in the specialty book as well as the traditional products?","Tim Guttman","Steve, I'll start and certainly you can jump in. Brand inflation is -- I called out that our LIFO is just pretty significant and again that's true though that brand inflation, we just carry so much brand inflation and in brand inventory. But it's -- I called out Eric that\u2019s in the mid teens and that\u2019s up over the last few years, we used be kind of 10% to 12%. At least for the inventory that we carry for our customers on our mix it may be different for others but at least for our inventory we're kind of in the mid teens and I really can't comment on how long that will last or kind of go forward, I just know what we've experienced and in our LIFO is based off our drug company and their inventory. Our specialty business is an addon LIFO so they don\u2019t factor into that. But they have also as an aside they have also seen some price increases on the brand side in that business as well.","Steve Collis","As far as ASP drugs they tends to be smaller and maybe more frequent that increases there but it's hard in an ASP environment to take a double digit increase and be good. Your customers would be under water but that\u2019s also just you know here are therapies coming in and comparable therapies that have been in the market for a while looking at their price opportunity so I think really that difference and maybe a little bit stronger than we had expected. So definitely looking at the GAAP numbers Eric, so\u2026","Eric Percher","I appreciate that, so one last one before the next train, on generic inflation so I understand the elements that you\u2019ve walked us through. We've seen tremendous growth and the Progen [ph] book 20% this quarter 50% last we\u2019ve seen Walgreens come in and buying a lot of but you\u2019re now distributing a lot of generics. So I\u2019d expect that even on lower inflation you\u2019ve got now that a larger book to see benefits on. Is that not the case?","Tim Guttman","So we did our monthly business review for the drug company and we look at you know, we don\u2019t just look at the revenues we look at units and we very focused on this our key area of how we value customers is around compliance with contracts. So and honestly some of the customers that are most interesting to us post Walgreens world are the ones where we have big generic opportunity. So, we are very focused on it. So Steve do you have any additional comments?","Steve Collis","I would say remember that we do carry a fair amount of generic inventory but as we\u2019ve talked about in the past generic price increases are on a relatively lower percentage of that inventory and you just never know how that\u2019s going to impact your inventory, which items are going to increase. It\u2019s not across the entire portfolio where brand it tends to be at some point during the year tends to be across the portfolio.","Tim Guttman","I think in oncology we\u2019re very bullish about the value that we provide and again it\u2019s a very innovative model and [indiscernible] and her team are focused on driving a everyday value and creating value for the suppliers long term. I think it\u2019s not all about profits, it's also about quality of supply and some of the recent generic launches we\u2019ve been able to give our customers supply which has been very much appreciated by them. So, I think that wraps up Eric, the last question.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Steve Collis","So I\u2019d just end by saying that we are proud of the nine months that we reported for fiscal year \u201915 and these are definitely stellar numbers that our associates have produced use. So let me just wrap by saying that passion, innovation and partnership drive everything we do in AmerisourceBergen, our work is centered on being strategically relevant, economically competitive and easy to do business with. We believe our relationships with our customers and suppliers are excellent and we do not take it for granted rather our goal is to tirelessly look for continuous improvements in our offerings to our customers to enhance, medicine access and adherence. We appreciate your time this morning and hope that you found this information useful. Thanks very much.","Barbara Brungess","Thank you, Steve. And before we go I\u2019d like to highlight that we will be attending the Robert W. Baird Healthcare Conference in New York on September 10th and also the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference in New York on September 16th.
