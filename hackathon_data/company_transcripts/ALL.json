At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After a speaker\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek","Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and discuss the strengths and leading competitive position of Allstate's homeowners insurance business.","As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Allstate plans to announce catastrophe losses every month, removing the current $150 million reporting threshold. The enhancements to our catastrophe announcement process increases transparency for analysts and shareholders.","As many of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team. As I've transitioned to a new role in our P&C finance area. I'm leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of Mark Nogal, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward.","I'll now turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2 with Allstate's strategy. So our strategy has two components increase personal property liability market share, and then expand into other protection businesses. Starting with the upper oval that the personal property liability market provides consumers, protection we insure their autos, their homes, motorcycles, boats, personal liability.","We use differentiated products, sophisticated pricing, claims expertise, and a building in integrated digital enterprise to lower costs, which I'm sure will come up later. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding our protection offerings, and that's highlighted in the bottom oval.","Allstate offers customers a circle of protection. It's a wide range of products from Allstate life, workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection.","These growth platforms have extremely broad distribution, including major retailers, insurance brokers, work sites, auto dealers and manufacturers, telcos, and directly to consumers. They now comprise about 75% of our policies in force, although a much smaller percentage of our overall premiums.","We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities, to drive growth in these businesses. Some of these businesses also support the property liability businesses. This strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures that we have both sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.","We move to Slide 3. Allstate strategy is delivering growth and attractive returns. Revenues exceeded $11 billion in the third quarter of 2019; Property Liability earned premium, which grew 5.6%. Strong operating capabilities enabled us to generate net income of $889 million in the quarter. Adjusted net income was $946 million or $2.84 per diluted share, as you can see in the bottom of the slide. Returns were also attracted with an adjusted net income return on equity of 14.2%.","We turn to Slide 4. We also did really well on all of our 2019 operating priorities. And we have five of those, as you know they focus on both near term performance and long-term value creation.","The first three priorities, better serve customers, grow the customer base, and achieve target returns on capital, are all intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served, as an - Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved. Property liability policies increased by 664,000 from the prior year quarter to 33.6 million, as the Allstate and Esurance brands grew 1.9% and 5.9% respectively.","Allstate protection plans which of course was formerly SquareTrade were at 89.8 million. Total policies in force now exceed 136 million, an increase of 40.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Returns remained excellent with most individual businesses performing well. The $89 billion investment portfolio had excellent total returns and generated $880 million net investment income in the quarter.","Shareholder value is also being created by building long-term growth platforms. We increased telematics usage in the property liability businesses, and that's supported by having industry leading insurance solutions from Arity.","Allstate protection plan is achieving the acquisition goals we established two years ago. And sales in Europe are growing. Allstate identity protection, which we acquired about a year ago is integrating its products into our customer value propositions.","Mario will now discuss our results by segment in more detail.","Mario Rizzo","Thanks, Tom. Moving to Slide 5, you can see that property liability results continue to reflect strong operating capabilities. Net written premium increased 5.8% in the third quarter, or $1.5 billion for the first nine months. This reflects policy growth in the Allstate and |Esurance brands and higher average premium for auto and homeowners insurance across all three underwritten brands.","As you can see in the middle of the left table, total policies in force, increased 2% to $33.6 million. Underwriting income of $737 million was substantially better than the prior year quarter, due to lower catastrophe losses.","Moving to the bottom of the table, the property liability recorded combined ratio of 91.6 was 2.3 points better than the prior year quarter, reflecting a planned improvement in the expense ratio, offsetting an increase in the non-catastrophe loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates was 85.0 through the first nine months of 2019.","Moving to the right hand table, Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance net written premium increased 4.5% and 6.7% respectively, compared to the prior year quarter, due to increase policies in force and a higher average premium.","Esurance, auto insurance policy growth was 5.5%, which combined with average premium increases resulted in total net written premium growth of 8.3%. Encompass written premium increased 2.6% as higher average premium more than offset a small decline in policies in force.","On the bottom of the table, you can see that underlying combined ratios remain strong across our brands. Esurance reflects primarily auto insurance, which has a higher combined ratio than homeowners when catastrophes are excluded, Encompass on the other hand, reflects a 60:40 mix of auto and homeowners insurance premiums.","Let's go to Slide 6, which highlights investment performance which benefited from overall market returns and proactive risk and return management. The portfolio generated a strong 7.8% return over the last 12 months, of which 1.9% was in the third quarter.","Approximately half of this total return came from interest income on the fixed income investment portfolio and returns on the performance based portfolio. The remainder was due to portfolio appreciation, reflecting lower market yields and higher equity values. The chart at the bottom shows net investment income for the third quarter of $880 million, $36 million higher than the third quarter of 2018.","Market based investment income shown in blue, increased to $727 million from $683 million a year ago, reflecting investment at market yields above the portfolio yield. Performance based income, shown in grey, was $202 million in the third quarter. $12 million lower than the prior year quarter,","Slide 7 highlights results for Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $44 million in the third quarter, $31 million lower than the prior year quarter. This is largely due to the write-down of deferred acquisition costs, driven by lower interest rates and model refinements in connection with the annual actuarial assumption review.","Excluding the impact of the non-cash unlock charge in both periods, adjusted net income was $86 million in the third quarter, an increase of $6 million, or 7.5% compared to the prior year quarter.","Allstate benefits adjusted net income was slightly lower than the prior year quarter, as higher premiums were more than offset by increased DAC amortization, driven by lower projected investment returns related to our annual actuarial review of assumptions. Excluding the impact of the noncash unlock charge in both periods adjusted net income was $32 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million or 3.2% ","Unlock charge in both periods adjusted net income was $32 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million, or 3.2%, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher premiums. All state annuities on the right generated adjusted net income of $16 million in the quarter, which was $4 million lower than the third quarter of 2018, due to higher contract benefits and reduced investment income. Adjusted net income of $43 million for the first nine months was substantially below the prior year, reflecting lower performance based investment income in the first quarter of this year.","Let's turn to Slide 8. Service businesses continue to grow the number of consumers protected with policies in force increasing 67.7% to $95.9 million. This is largely due to Allstate protection plans. Revenues increased 27.1% to $418 million, as you can see from the lower left table, due to growth in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services, as well as the acquisition of Allstate identity protection last year.","Revenues to the first nine months now exceed $1.2 billion. Adjusted net income was $8 million in the quarter shown in the lower right, a $7 million improvement over the prior year quarter, largely due to improved loss experience in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services.","Slide 9, highlights the continued strength of our capital position and financial flexibility. In the third quarter, we issued $1.15 billion of 5.1% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem $1.13 billion of fixed rate perpetual preferred stock with an average dividend yield of 6.54%. These actions will lower annual dividend costs by about $16 million.","We continue to deliver excellent returns to shareholders. In the third quarter of 2019, we returned $775 million to common shareholders through a combination of $166 million in common stock dividends and $609 million of share repurchases. We have repurchased 6.7% of common shares outstanding over the last 12 months. Book value per share is up over $9 over the last 12 months.","Now, I'll turn it over to Glenn, who will discuss our special topic of Allstate brand homeowners insurance and how we are positioned to generate industry leading returns while growing market share.","Glenn Shapiro","Thanks, Mario. Homeowner's insurance is a great business for Allstate, as you can see on Slide 10. Allstate is the second largest homeowners insurance in the United States with 6.6 million policies in force. We have written premium, $7.6 billion in the Allstate brand over $400 million in Encompass. And Esurance is also expanding into homeowners insurance, using Allstate's capabilities, and now it's over 100,000 policies in force.","A significant portion of our customers bundle home in auto, which improves retention, and overall economics of both product lines the key message on homeowners insurance as it generate substantial underwriting income and attractive returns on capital. To achieve these results, we target an underlying combined ratio in the low 60s to handle volatility that comes with catastrophe losses.","Since 2012, we've generated over $1 billion of underwriting income on average annually, including catastrophe losses. As a result, returns on economic capital are in the mid to high teens. This profitability also provides diversification to auto insurance profitability.","The graph at the bottom of the page shows homeowners insurance combined ratios for Allstate and the industry since 2012. As you can see, Allstate has consistently outperformed the industry. The results is that we've earned over half of the industry-wide underwriting income in that period.","Turning to Slide 11. Allstate optimizes returns through sophisticated portfolio management. We've improved returns and decreased homeowners insurance volatility through advanced catastrophe modeling, geographic diversification of business and strategic use of reinsurance. Our spread of the business across the country works to our advantage by providing a significant diversification benefit as timing, type and magnitude of weather events differ based on geography.","As you could see on the U.S. map, we have a top three market share in 20 states which are shown in green, but much lower shares in states like California and Florida prone to catastrophes like wildfire, earthquakes and hurricanes.","We take a proactive approach to managing our exposure to different types of risks. We substantially reduced our exposure in California to earthquakes by helping establish the California Earthquake Authority in 1996. And we've decreased our underwritten policies in force there in the last decade.","In Florida, we reduced our market share from about 10% in 2003, to less than 2% today. We also helped shape the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund, which provides reinsurance. And we use a separately capitalized company there, Castle Key and process external reinsurance. The overall objective is to meet customer protection needs while optimizing shareholder risk and return.","We underwrite risk directly where we can achieve target returns. We also broke a nearly $1.4 billion of other insurance property policies. This allows us to meet our customer protection needs, leverage our distribution strength with more customers, bundle additional Allstate products, but not directly right risks outside of our underwriting appetite.","In total, we manage our portfolio of states to target a combined ratio that generates attractive returns. For new competitors in homeowners insurance, the state level \u2013 profit dynamic makes it difficult to them to achieve the same level of overall profitability or have the resources to expand.","We shift an extensive amount of catastrophe risk to reinsurance markets which reduces our capital requirements, and protects annual returns. The reinsurance program covers individual large events, utilizing traditional reinsurance and alternative capital. The current nationwide reinsurance program provides over $4.3 billion of limits above a $500 million retention for any single event.","We also use an aggregate cover in case there are multiple events below $500 million. This provides additional protection in case the accumulation of those events throughout the year exceeds $3.5 billion.","Moving to Slide 12. We're not standing still and we're constantly innovating in this space. We're focused on customer value and ease of doing business to accelerate growth. We streamline the homeowner quoting process by using both proprietary and third-party data sources to increase efficiency and accuracy.","Using this information, we've reduced the number of questions asked in the quoting process from over 40 to just three when bundling homeowners and auto insurance together. In many cases, after our quote is complete and we bind coverage, there's an inspection of the home.","Technology, such as aerial imagery and predictive modeling has enhanced the speed and efficiency of those inspections and lowered our expenses. We continue to enhance the design of our homeowner\u2019s product while increasing our pricing sophistication.","Our homeowner\u2019s product house and home is better able to address severe weather risks and unique customer needs. For example, the product includes a graduated roof coverage schedule, though it still provides the ability for customers to \u2013 purchase full replacement if they choose.","House and home now represents 90% of our new business and about 45% of our total policies in force. The pricing of house and home is more sophisticated than traditional homeowner\u2019s insurance products with more occupant and residents characteristics.","We've also improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our claims handling through technology and innovation. We leverage our scale, data, and analytics, to rapidly deploying more than 700 full time catastrophe resources to quickly help customers when they need it most, while mitigating damage and managing costs.","We use aerial imagery to improve our efficiency and customer experience. We've expanded virtual claim handling capabilities, including the use of drones, airplanes and satellites, so that now nearly 70% of all wind and hail claims have some aspect of the claim handled virtually compared to less than 10% in 2017.","The bottom line is Allstate has a significant competitive advantage in homeowners insurance. We'll continue to leverage our scale, pricing sophistication risk management, distribution system and claims capabilities to deliver industry leading returns and market share gains.","We'll now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please?","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, I wanted to spend some time on the expense ratio and property liability. It's been low now for a couple of quarters and I know last quarter, you guys had pointed to a combination of improvement in processes, automation, as well as incentive comp is driving down the second quarter expense ratio.","You could just give us a sense if it's kind of the similar components that drove down the ratio in the third quarter, and just how we should think about modeling through that expense level going forward?","Glenn Shapiro","Yes thanks Elyse, it\u2019s Glenn, We're definitely focused on improving expenses. We've been faster this and going after it hard. I mentioned a few of the examples last quarter where, we've been able to reduce customer inquiry calls, which is a win-win, because it's better customer experience, because we've eliminated the need for those calls on the front end, but it also is more efficient on the back end.","I mentioned in special topic there some of the aerial imagery and data analytics we're using in both claims and to reduce inspection. So we've gone after some real tangible ways we can manage expense. As with any quarter there is a mix of things in there. So similar to last quarter, there is some components to compensation, some components of marketing, some components of sustainable improvements in the baseline of that.","But, we've made some real tangible improvements that we will sustain and we're going after expenses in a real way, because we think it's a path towards growth where we can, maintain margins.","Elyse Greenspan","Can you breakdown give a little bit of color on what might be in a sustainable bucket versus maybe, what was kind of one-time in nature in this quarter and the expense level?","Glenn Shapiro","I don't know that there was a lot of one-time in this. So we've got, where it is sustainable. It says operational improvements, which is, a meaningful chunk of the change that we've got. When you look at some of the compensation components, we've managed, both are, employee compensation and agency compensation over time and you reset every year with a new program.","So there's a little bit of benefit in there from that, that we were short to our growth aspirations in the year but otherwise we've got sustainable, expensive prudence in here.","Tom Wilson","Elyse one place this time, one place, we would like, this quarter was marketing, which we will dial up as we talked about last quarter, we're dialing out there, there's some select markets where we know that we can generate economic growth. That said, that won't change the overall trend line of expensive should be coming down over time. But you know, every quarter is new quarter so.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question on, we've seen some of your peers that have seen higher bodily injury severity trends within their auto book of business, or just could you just give us an update on what you're seeing on the BI severity side and just - if you've seen any pockets where trend is pick up in the U.S.?","Tom Wilson","Let me give you, first we can't comment on everybody else's numbers because, as in bodily injury, those are long data claims it takes three, four years to really get them paid out depending, the little ones get closed early, the big ones get closed late. So you always have some bounce of mix in the paid BI that you have to get underneath. That said, we feel good about where overall bodily injury reserves are set and our trends Glenn can talk about the pay trend.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, so we feel good about where we are in bodily injuries we put in the Q, you know we\u2019re running around medical inflation. As Tom mentioned on the reserving, it's all in the numbers I think would be a headline there because in our reserving actuaries so talented folks, they work very closely with our claims team, our underwriters, our product organization, they all work together to ensure that we have, the right reserves on the book.","And if you look at the trends over time, we've had, a lot more favorable development and unfavorable development through the years, which is, good, bellwether for you to look at in terms of our overall trends.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.","Greg Peters","My first question, I'd like to revisit of how your guidance is going to look for 2020. John I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that they're going to start disclosing monthly cat loss numbers. I also remember from a previous presentation that you said you were going to shift from an underlying combine ratio target to a target return sort of guidance. And just wondering if this is a trailing ROE target, do you plan to adjust it for changes in interest rates, et cetera just looking for some color there?","John Griek","Well Greg thanks for the question. We love the fact that you are paying attention to what we say makes real good. The monthly cat numbers it's just a clean up what people are like, is it above 150 what if it's 149 we felt like it was confusing stuff. So we're just put out monthly you can do what you people, everyone is got different things they use it for. So just to make your lives easier and that\u2019s more transparent.","As it relates to the return on equity as we're replacing the annual underwriting - underlying combined ratio guidance with longer term ROE goals. ROE is a better measure of the overall business results because it includes first includes our businesses and includes investment incomes and ties directly to reported results which includes catastrophes.","The underlying combined ratio of course, only reflects their property liability businesses, and it excludes catastrophes which bounce around a lot from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But on a long-term basis as a management team we're accountable for making sure that we get a good return on homeowners with catastrophes included it because that's the risk our shareholders take.","So, what we're going to do when we report full year 2019 results is give you what we think a long-term ranges on return on equity and debt management should be held accountable to.","Greg Peters","What do you define as long range and is this adjusted earnings that it's on?","John Griek","Yes, it will be on adjusted earnings just because the accounting - as we move to fair value accounting the book value and reported income bounces around a lot with equity investment. So we feel like adjusted net income return on equity is a better measure of what we want to do. Long-term would be sort of what do you expect to do over two to three years but the goal really is to get people focused and our shareholders focus on what's the overall return we're generating and the capital you have and focus on the overall side of the business, as opposed to just one component.","And while auto insurance and homeowners insurance are extremely important to our business, so we are not the only thing we got going, and that the only thing we should be held accountable to. So ROE is just a much better measure under which you can judge how well you think we're doing as a team.","Greg Peters","Great, thank you for that answer. My second question is, I just a follow-up on the expense. I noted from the Page 9 of your supplement that your agency count was up, year-over-year and sequentially, and your license sales professional account was up, year-over-year and sequentially. And I'm trying to reconcile this with the fact that you're not reporting any restructuring charges, which is unusual, considering the improvement you've realized","And then secondly, on previous call Glenn has mentioned something along the lines of an integrated services platform, and so the numbers are kind of moving contrary to what I think that would be. So maybe you can provide some additional color there?","Tom Wilson","Well let me deal with some components, Glenn can talk about what we're doing with our agency platform to make it more effective and efficient, including things like integrated service and what we're doing in compensation to drive that growth. As it relates to restructuring, we do end up with some little minor restructuring charges that go through there in the Q someplace, but they're not big numbers.","As we move forward, as we move through integrate digital enterprise we just record what we think we have to record under the rules. If it means, we have, headcount go down because we're using integrated digital enterprise and we have to record a charge that we do it. But we don't feel like there is one big bucket that's needed at this point, that we then carve it out and don't come back and hold ourselves accountable for because it's some other charts in place.","Glenn Shapiro","So yes, thanks for the question Greg and as Tom said you\u2019re definitely paying attention to the details in there. So if you look at the agent council start with that, some of that it\u2019s a reflection of, the investment folks are willing to make in the business based on the opportunity, and there's good opportunity with Allstate. And we are, we're growing items and we're profitable and been successful.","So, agents are putting their nickel down, these are small business owners who are opening up a shop and going out and selling product and serving the needs of consumers. In terms of the license sales professional that's reflective of their hiring, they're doing mostly on the sales side of that.","Now that said, I'll mention as Tom said, a compensation component leading into next year, as well as the integrated service that you brought up. From a compensation standpoint, we're leaning more of the compensation towards new business production. We're interested in growing so as we increase marketing, we've improved our expense we'd be more effective and cost effective for customers and we ","-- be more effective and cost-effective for customers. And we lean more into new business production in terms of the compensation as we shift that in that direction. We think that's a good system wide approach to go drive growth.","In terms of integrated service, we have talked about it before. It's in the early stages. It's a big system. We have 40,000 people in that agency system, when you take the agents and all of their employees, licensed and unlicensed, sales and service.","So today we do that service in a decentralized way. A lot of the service is done in individual offices, which you're not scaling, is not ultimately going to be as cost effective as you can do it in a more scaled way.","So we built an integrated service model. We're doing that with - we're getting into hundreds of agents, not thousands of agents, at this point. So, from a scale perspective, you wouldn't see it showing up in the numbers that you looked at there at this point.","Tom Wilson","And Greg, just the change in agency compensation, we don't expect to raise overall compensation as a percentage of premiums.","Glenn Shapiro","Correct. Yes, it was a shift.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?","Yaron Kinar","Can you talk about the increase in property damage frequency and Allstate brand auto this quarter? And are you guys sort of just little surprised to see that given the more recent trends?","Glenn Shapiro","So first of all, I always like to go back to the overall profitability of auto, and we're doing very well. They're 92 combined ratio, some of that is the expenses and I'll come back to sort of some of the intentionality there.","Frequency, first of all, it's hard to predict. You can't predict what is going to happen in the next year, next quarter, but you can understand the trends and where things are moving. So miles driven, we're up. We saw some change in what had been a declining trend to frequency.","That said, it was a little bit mixed. So I'll point you to a few different numbers. Gross frequency was up two points, as you pointed out. But paid frequency, which on a short-term tail line tends to be pretty accurate, was flat. And BI frequency was slightly down.","So I look at the overall frequency picture and say: It's kind of a mixed story in there and something that we're keeping a close eye on.","Now you go a level below that, and at a local level, every state manager is out there looking at their competitiveness, their trends, their frequency, their severity in every state. And we're managing that profitability at that local level. So that's what rolls up into a really favorable return, as we've delivered.","And then lastly on expenses, I want to keep going back to that because part of the reason or the main reason you go after expenses the way we are is actually allows you to let the loss ratio float up and deliver the same return. And that's what it looks like in our ratios when you're giving back more value to the customers.","Yaron Kinar","And then the second question going to homeowners, also saw an increase in severity there. I guess just given the amount of pricing that the companies has pushed through over the last year, I was still surprised to see the deterioration, actually your loss ratio from a pretty weak prior year quarter to begin with, even when that increase in severity.","So can you maybe talk about that dynamic of maybe where the severity has come from and why the price increases we've seen to date have not been sufficient to offset it?","Tom Wilson","Homeowners is one of those businesses where it's really difficult to look at it by quarter, what happens with severity. Because it's obviously impacted by weather, sometimes its cats, sometimes it's not a cat.","And so you have to really look it on kind of a rolling 12-month basis. And when you look at our business, it's got great returns. We feel really good about it. If you look at the average premium, it's way up. And when you go underneath that, and as Glen said, we'd like to segment this down, then we segment it by state, we segment it by coverage.","And in homeowners, depending what kind of loss you have, it changes your paid severity a lot. And again, those tend to be relatively short tail line. But so a fire loss has a much different severity if the house burns, then obviously if somebody runs into the garage door, or hail damage can tend to be much more expensive because it could take out a whole roof than some leaky pipes.","So it really depends. The mix drives a lot of it. Theft is not as big as water damage. So, what I would say is Glenn's comments on this special topic, we feel really good by homeowners. Like, it's a really good business, making really good money, much better.","And I want to just underline what I said. With a 9% share of the market, we've captured half of the overall profits generated in homeowners in the industry. So we feel like that's indicative of good operating expertise and capabilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question please.","Jay Gelb","My first question was on commercial auto and the ride sharing agreement with the major providers there. One other competitor in that market has had some issues negatively. So just wanted to understand how Allstate is going to position that business?","Steve Shebik","So let me start off and say, that we call it a shared economy business, so it's not just lunch share and car sharing. We look more broadly. And so obviously you've focused on the largest customer we have, but we have a handful of others that we're building an entire team to have knowledge all around that.","Obviously, we are well aware of other competitors in the industry. And the particular competitor you talked about, strengthened their reserves in the 2016 and 2017 year when the industry was kind of early in development.","We started last year, and if you remember, I think in prior calls I've talked about how we triangulated our loss reserves on the basis of the prior history that was provided by the transition network company that we used our own internal, both personal lines and commercial auto experience.","And we've also looked at industry experience and our telematics type of information that we get \u2013 we're just at state level. Because remember, we have 15 States we're insuring, not the entire country.","So we're comfortable with where we're sitting. We're still recording essentially at the priced amount for the reserves, primarily because the vast majority of the coverage is the long tail coverages. So it's still early, 19-months since that first month. I think long tail coverages historically take longer than [indiscernible]. It's still coming along through us.","We look at it every quarter. As you may remember, independently, our reserves are reviewed and set by a team that works in claim reserve, looking for Mario and not for me.","So we had different eyes on it from our actual department, from our financial department, obviously in the business too so. [indiscernible]. Does that answer your question?","Jay Gelb","It does, it does. And then on a separate topic, thinking about the underlying combined ratio in the protection business - the underlying loss ratio, excuse me. Having that show an increase year-over-year, my sense is some investors are a little concerned about what's going on in terms of price competition in auto and then also the potential for claims inflation to increase.","So can you just remind us how Allstate is managing that issue to restrain underlying loss ratio deterioration?","Mario Rizzo","Yes, Jay, let me provide some overall context and Glenn can jump in on the relationship between expenses and loss ratio. So, first, as you know, our auto insurance has largest product line.","It comprises about 65% of our total premiums and it's obviously an important lead line as well because it helps us expand into the homeowner's insurance business, which is also highly profitable.","So it's a really important question: Are you going to maintain your profitability on auto insurance so you can keep growing it? But before we go into the specifics on expenses and loss ratios, let me just talk about principles for a minute and a little bit of our history.","So we have some guiding principles on our growth. First, we only want to grow when we get a good return for our shareholders. I mean, it seems simple, but it's not everybody follows that path. And as you know the auto business generates really attractive returns, it's in the low-90s when you add that and homeowner's insurance to the equation that's a big driver of our return on equity, which was 14.2% for last 12-months. But when you adjust out annuities, it's over 17.","So we're getting a really good return on that business. So what we've put in place has been, it's been working. Secondly, we do segment the business by in terms of growth and profitability by business, geography, customer group, and risk, so that we get attractive margins in each segment. And that gives us that solid base from which we can be sustainable in terms of growth.","So if auto margins drop in one state or I want coverage, we had the benefit of good margins than auto insurance in another state or on another coverage or in the homeowners business.","Our third principle is we create shareholder focus, or create shareholder value by focusing on profit and growth at the same time, but we default to profit if necessary. And so, we employ that philosophy across everything we do. So for example, let's go to insurance and you know, when we first bought insurance, it was running a combined ratio well over 100. And we invested heavily in that.","We believe and know now, that their growth created shareholder value because the return on the business we were writing was higher than our cost of capital. The accounting however, required us to write up all the advertising expenses up front, which resulted in an underwriting loss. So after the first year of course, then that advertising expense goes away you capture all the underwriting profit and it's very profitable.","And so, it took a while before that profitable business can offset the negative of first year business think over when you spend $200 million a year on advertising. So as a result that growth reduced underwriting and even though it's positive for shareholder value. So we try to think about are we creating shareholder value. Our first principle we\u2019re creating shareholder value when we're doing this.","We can do it and we chose to do it on insurance because we had strong profitability coming from the Allstate brand, auto and homeowners business. And so the concept of portfolio growth, Glenn talked about how it applies at the auto insurance level, it implies for homeowners. It also applies across the whole company. And so now, insurance is two and a half times the size when we bought it.","A similar situation exists for Allstate protection plans. So we acquired square trade, which has been renamed also a protection plans a couple of years ago for 1.4 billion, which is equivalent to about four bucks a share the Allstate share. As you know now their business is over twice its size we got 89 million policies enforce its got great distribution, its growing the European cell phone business and now it has reported profits albeit small, reported profits.","And so valuing that business on an earnings basis, clearly understate shareholder value. So our challenge has been to make sure we give you the information to see value creation, but not get everybody so focused on the 65% of the business, that that's the only thing that matters in terms of creating shareholder value. So it's a really important question, how are you growing that two-thirds of the business to make sure you make money.","But I also wanted to just take this opportunity to say like, don't forget about everything else, because there's a third of the rest of the business that drives shareholder value that when we get so focused on just auto insurance margins, it takes people's eye off the other stuff, which is why we moved to ROE. But obviously, we're very focused on auto insurance profit. We feel really good about it. And we need to make sure we keep doing that.","So Glenn will talk about what Mario mentioned is our intentional strategy to grow the business, offer really good value to our customers by reducing our expenses. And then having the loss ratio drift up, which enables us to maintain margins, and still keep clocking that high teens return on equity from that business.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, so thanks, Tom, you know as you way out the principles there, clearly we're in an environment in auto that meets those growth principles and so, we want to go after that. But that said, its environment we've chosen to grow in, but it's a competitive environment, we got significant increases in advertising out there. We have an extremely low CPI. So we acknowledge all that in terms of the competition and we're doing things smart as to how we grow as opposed to chasing it.","I think you could call our combined ratio now a little bit of a restructured combined ratio because as you point out Jay, the loss ratio was up, the expense ratio was down. I would argue that it's a lot better than the other way around. That if you think about sustainability, if we were here having this conversation and we were like a point or two up on expenses but we had a huge tailwind because frequency to drop through the floor in the quarter. I think we\u2019re - having a different conversation.","So I look at this as a as a positive, sustainable way for us to go after growth and show that we can do it in a way that's going to continue to provide that, mid high teens return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Mike Zaremski","I guess I'm staying on the expense ratio improvement which is enabling you to grow more. There was a media reporter to about shifting certain customer service responsibilities out of the agencies and into call centers which can service customers, potentially more cost effectively. I'm kind of curious if that's part of the reason agent compass is falling and why maybe a permanent decline or just you can correct me if I'm totally off on that?","Tom Wilson","First I may go up for a minute, Mike and say we want to use technology and our people to do a really great job for our customers. And with what you can do in technology today, you can make your people a lot more productive, and make them give a great service and spend less money. So, we've talked multiple times by a quick photo claim with a productivity of a claim adjuster is multiple to what it used to be because they're not driving around from body shop to body shop.","They're sitting in front of a computer, looking at pictures, deciding what should be done with their customers. So that's ripping through our business. We have lots of ways, we're working on doing that and that's what gives us the confidence that we can do a better job for our customers with less expenses. Glenn talked about integrated service, which is the thing you're referring to, and you don't see it in the numbers.","It would be what I would say today. It's not you know, we started with 50 agents this year we're getting the processes down. We're not going to turn this loose on 22 million customers, until such policies until such time as we make sure it works really well. Because the system we have works really well. Our net promoter score was up again this quarter. We like what our agents are doing that said, we think we can do better by leaning into innovation, rather than go.","So you're not seeing anything on integrated service that\u2019s the media I think you're referring to. I mean there is so much media out there these days. I don't know whether it's fake news or not, but like \u2013 the reality is, as we are doing everything possible to give our customers great service, support our agencies, but do it in a cheaper way. And we're all in on that.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, great that's helpful. And lastly, Glenn, in your prepared remarks, you could I might be a little off. You talked about the state level profit dynamics, making it difficult for competitors to achieve all states homeowner\u2019s profitability. Maybe you can elaborate on that. And also, I'm curious if there's any parallels to auto insurance as well? Thanks.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes so, thanks for the question on it. I think the basic premise there is, you know, we have a lot of scale and we've got, breath across states in our blend in our mix across the state is not only a 50 state view and so we've got it everywhere. But we've also been thoughtful and made choices about where we're larger and smaller, given the types of risks we face, which really challenging for the smaller or newer carrier going into it.","It\u2019s getting that type of breath across a system where you can offset your highs and lows. It's similar to, what you do with an investment portfolio. You're mixing your investment portfolio in different ways so that when one thing is up another one is down, and you're getting an overall good return, that's really challenging if you're starting out and you're only allowed to buy four stocks.","Tom Wilson","Let me also add to that, so let's just compare homeowners to auto insurance. So homeowner\u2019s is more volatile on an individual location basis than auto insurance. So you should put up more capital for homeowners insurance than you should for auto insurance. In addition, with homeowners insurance, you get very little investment income visits are relatively short tail way as opposed to auto insurance you get a decent amount of investment income off it.","So as a result of that you have to run a combined ratio in homeowners insurance that's below that would you run in auto insurance. So your combined ratio and homeowner should always be below your combine that's not true for everybody but so in total, you got to get there. The problem is it like if there is hail in Dallas one year, and then not for two more years. There is hail in Oklahoma, because it got dumped in Oklahoma before it got to Dallas the next year.","And so, if you're only in Dallas and you got to earn that low combined ratio, and the hail happens to get you in that year, it's pretty hard to then have the money to expand into Oklahoma. So that's what Glenn is talking about. But the businesses, when you look at the homeowners business, and as more people get into it, I think it's worthwhile focusing on what is their actual return on capital in that business, as opposed to just growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question please.","Crystal Lu","This is Crystal Lu and for Ryan Tunis. Our first question again on the expense ratio. It seems like the expense ratio has improved a lot, but it doesn't seem to be translating into auto policy growth acceleration yet. And it seems like some of that expense improvement came from advertising, which tends to grow to drive growth. So I'm wondering what actions are being taken right now, where you're investing in growth and going to see that policy growth acceleration in the future?","Tom Wilson","Well, first, if you look at our auto insurance growth, it's about two points, which we think is more than the number of cars and have grown in United States. So we think we're picking up market share, albeit a small amount of market share and we'd like to have more.","So we are investing more in marketing, but that doesn't change the overall trend that Glenn talked about. I mean, we're going to - our overall trend is reduce expenses, be competitive at price, maintain margins at levels that are attractive.","Is it going to be the same level each quarter? It bounces around a lot depending on what frequency happens, but we liked the returns. We're good at getting returns in auto insurance and we have proven that we can grow it and we're going to work on keep producing expenses so we can continue to be competitive.","Crystal Lu","And on the auto rate increases that you guys have been getting this year, it doesn't seem to have slowed very much in the first nine months, despite efforts to pass along more savings to customers and grow the business. So can you kind of describe the auto pricing environment right now and how you're thinking about auto pricing in terms of growing?","Tom Wilson","Yes, thank you Crystal. First of all, we manage all of our pricing and state-by-state basis. And I would say, in terms of the slowing, I would look at it relative to the lost cost trends. And so I would say it's slowed. We've taken over trailing 12 months, 2.2 auto rate that's translated into an average gross premium of 3%. But if you look at the severity trends running five this quarter, in the trailing 12 months, higher than that, we've not had rate that keeps up with that. And as we talked about earlier, we've offset it with lower expenses and that's where you give more value to the customer is not taking rate that has to keep all the way up with those types of inflationary factors.","But, as Tom has said several times, we managed this for profitable growth and we're committed to a strong return. And when we look state-by-state at that, we're looking at our competitiveness, what our price looks like relative to our competitors by different customer cohorts in each market, but also, what our return on all of his cohorts are in each market. And so I think our pricing has trailed the lost trend, which is part of what we're offsetting with the expenses.","Glenn Shapiro","It's hard Crystal to, and I'm not trying to - it's really the level of sophistication of pricing today in auto insurance is so high that, while the numbers overall are important to maintaining looking at the trend in the margins and definitely look at those.","In terms of growth, a lot of it depends what sales you're growing in, what your new business discount is. There's a lot of things we do, and our competitors do to make sure we capture business, which is generates long-term economic growth.","So it's, but - it's a pretty, it's not a robust, we're not seeing people take a bunch of rates right now, you know, state farm's taken some decreases but given where they are in overall price, we think they probably need to take some price decreases because they're pretty high priced. We feel competitive like price right now.","Crystal Lu","That makes sense. And then one more quick one on the auto bodily injury reserve releases this quarter. Could you just give a little bit more detail on what accident years are those are coming from and whether that reflects the level of severity being in line with medical inflation. Is that running at a lower level than you were expecting in those years? Thanks.","Mario Rizzo","So Crystal, this is Mario. I guess the first thing I'd say is just reiterate what Glenn said in terms of - we establish reserves and look at reserves every quarter. We have some pretty robust processes that we follow. We take all relevant facts and circumstances both internal and external trends into account. And then we also take into account any changes in claim handling practice.","So we have a really thorough reserve setting process and we tend to be conservative in how we set those reserves. What you saw this quarter in terms of the releases, we're predominantly in all state brand, auto injury coverages, and we continue to feel good, not only about the severity trends that we're seeing in the current year, but we're seeing favorable development in the prior years that is better than what we expected when we established the reserves. So it's really coming across a number, a number of accident years but we continue to feel really good about our reserve position, and our injury severity trends.","Tom Wilson","And the amount from each prior year wouldn\u2019t really help you. So it's because it's what we picked as opposed to what the trends - the absolute trends are, but when we do the cadence there's obviously the triangles are in there and so.","Operator","Our final question then for today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. I was looking at the policy count numbers in auto and it seems like there's a slowdown, but I'm wondering if we can sort of break it down to gross policy ads versus a gross policy declines. Are Allstate customers sticking with you and the new customers have slowed. How should we parse that out?","Tom Wilson","That's a pretty detailed level of question, Josh. So first overall retention was flat this quarter basically for statistical reasons, I mean it's kind of down slightly, but it's basically flat. So that means we're keeping in total as many or as a percentage of our customers, as you're correct in assuming that a new business doesn't have its higher retention as people have been with you 10 years. By the time somebody has been with you, actually, people don't wait two, three, four years. They pretty much tend to stay with you really high retention levels.","So growth will drive your retention down despite the fact that we were growing over last couple of years. Our retention has gone up because we're doing a better job on customer service with our net promoter score up. So I don't - I think in terms of our overall growth, you should expect to see more of it come from new business in the future than further increases in retention, if that's helpful.","Josh Shanker","And when I look at the decline ad spend and I guess compensation to agents or maybe right thing that incorrectly, or is that directly tie-able to the amount of new business coming in?","Tom Wilson","You sound like you're looking at a specific number. Maybe what we can do is Glenn can answer for you what the new comp. So we're going to - we'd said we could spend more money in advertising. We're working on that and we expect to still bring our overall expenses down as we do that over time. May not be every quarter, but we're headed down in that direction. And then - but Glenn can talk about what we're doing on compensation.","Glenn Shapiro","And a quick add I'll make to the marketing because this has come up a couple of times. It's during a year-over-year basis the marketing was lower? On a sequential quarter basis, it was up. We're comparing to a quarter last year where there was a new brand launch and you know, so, but we're ramping up and we'll continue to do that with marketing.","From a compensation standpoint, as we talked about earlier, it really is about shifting towards new business production. You ultimately, you compensate agents for the service they provide to customers and for going out and punting and getting new business, and we're within the confines of that amount of money, that compensation system, we're shifting money towards new business production to incentivize that more in the compensation plan going into next year.","Tom Wilson","So, what we're trying to do is, go on a great customer value proposition. We want a good price. We want good service. We're lowering expenses. You should expect to see us continue to lower expenses as we go forward from here and then as loss ratio goes up, that just means you\u2019re offering greater value. They're paying less for expenses and more for fixing stuff that got broke.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for the answers and good luck with that.","Tom Wilson","Okay. First, thank you for being on the call. Let me thank John for being both a transparent and direct source to you for a little over three years. He's done a fabulous job. We are excited to see him move on in his career and I know Mark will do a great job. He's worked with John, so it'll be seamless for you and us.","As it relates to Allstate, yes, we made really good progress this year on our strategy, our operating priorities remain focused on profitable growth, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Griek","Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Mario Rizzo; and me, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement, and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement.","In the fourth quarter, the company adopted new reporting segments, expanding from four to seven. The new structure provides enhanced transparency and allows for an evaluation of our businesses grouped by like attributes. Also in the fourth quarter, we discontinued the use of the term operating income and have replaced the label with adjusted net income.","We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate\u2019s operating results. At the beginning of the year, we made several leadership changes in anticipation of Matt Winter\u2019s retirement later this month. Matt has been instrumental in our proactive operating approach and helped maintain our deep bench talent. Matt and the rest of the senior leadership team are here with us today, which includes Glenn Shapiro, who\u2019s assumed leadership of the Allstate brand Property-Liability business. Glenn joined us about two years ago. He has 28 years of insurance experience. He successfully lead our claims operation as part of Matt\u2019s team, and they did a number of very innovative things like improving our process is to control costs and introduced new technologies, such as QuickFoto Claim app.","Steve Shebik is our Vice Chair, and he\u2019s taken on responsibility for Esurance, Encompass, Allstate Life, Annuities and Benefits, Business Transformation and D3, our analytics operation. You all know Steve, he\u2019s been with us for 23 years and most recently with our Chief Financial Officer. Mario Rizzo is now our Chief Financial Officer, replacing Steve, so you\u2019re going to see a lot of him. He most recently was the CFO of Allstate Protection and he\u2019s been with us for 28 years.","Also here with us today are Don Civgin, who is President of Allstate Service Businesses; John Dugenske, who is our Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, who leads our three Allstate Financial businesses, the Life, Retirement and Benefit businesses; Eric Ferren, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","So let\u2019s start on Slide 2. We delivered strong results in 2017 and are positioned for profitable growth. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.2 billion or $3.35 per share, but that did include a onetime $506 million increase to net income as a result of the recently passed tax legislation.","Adjusted net income per share was $762 million or $2.09 a share, and that excludes the impact of the tax change and $125 million goodwill impairment in Allstate Annuities, which related to the change in reportable segments.","For the full year, adjusted net income of $2.5 billion was 34% above it\u2019s prior year and reflect strong performance from our market-facing businesses and investments. The Allstate auto and homeowners insurance margins remain very strong and performance-based investments had outstanding results.","Catastrophe losses of $3.2 billion or 26% above the prior year over largely offset by favorable prior year reserve estimates. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.3%, as you can see on the bottom right. This operational support \u2013 this operational success will support accelerated growth in 2018 while maintaining attractive returns.","So let\u2019s go to the Slide 3. Now this addresses the impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act for 2017. So the immediate impact from tax reform is that a onetime $506 million increase to net income, which is driven by a reduction in our net deferred tax liability. This principally relates to deferred acquisition costs, which were already expense for tax purposes at the higher tax rate. It also reflects lower feature taxes on unrealized investment gains.","In 2018, we anticipate a corporate tax rate of 19% to 20% compared to our historical effective tax rate in the low 30s. Future auto and homeowners insurance rates filings were reflect the impact of lower tax rates and will be factored into our regulatory filing, but we do not expect us to have a material impact in Allstate\u2019s near-term operating results or competitive position. We are taking advantage in lower taxes to increase growth, enhance the employer value proposition, raise shareholders returns and improve our local communities. We are investing in growth in many of our market facing businesses through marketing, distribution, telematics, new products and technology.","Employees will receive $1000 or $2000 choice dollars in 2018 depending on their participation in our medical benefit plan. This money can be contributed to our 401k or health savings account or taken as cash bonus. This structure of employee choice will be incorporated in the future benefit design. We\u2019ll also increase employee training and technology literacy to support sustainable employability. This is increasing in importance, particularly in our business as jobs are reconfigured and eliminated by digital technologies and the increased use of computer decision-making using advanced analytics.","Reflecting strong operating results and lower tax in the first quarter dividend was increased by 24%, which is up to $0.46 per common share. We also contributed an additional $34 to the Allstate Foundation in December to expand existing programs. And Allstate Agency supports local process, and you can see this had an impact on fourth quarter expense levels.","Turning to Slide 4, we had good results on all five 2017 operating priorities. We better served customers. And the Net Promoter Score which measures how likely customers are to recommend us, increased. Customer retention for Allstate brand auto improved in the second half of 2017 and Esurance auto and homeowners insurance retention increased throughout the year, which have maintained increased growth in 2018.","Higher customer satisfaction, in part reflects fewer price increases, but we also improve service in a number of areas, such as expanding utilization; a QuickFoto Claim, which can lower settlement times from days, hours as you probably seen in our advertising. We continue to deliver excellent returns on shareholder capital.","The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 93.6 generated $2 billion in underwriting income for the year. Auto insurance underwriting income increased to the lower accident frequency, higher premiums in favorable prior year reserve reestimates. Allstate brand homeowners insurance posted a combined ratio of 89.4 despite significant catastrophe losses, making this the sixth consecutive year of the combined ratio, which is in below 100.","Allstate Life and Benefits generated attractive returns and Annuity income was up, but returns are still low. Total policies in force grew to $82.3 million in 2017. Property-Liability policies in force decline due to the impact of the profit improvement actions began in 2015. SquareTrade policies grew $10 million or nearly 36% in 2017. Allstate Benefits continued its 17-year track record of growth with policies in force increasing by 7.4% in 2017.","Total return on $83 billion investment portfolio was 5.9%, reflecting strong results in both the market and performance-based portfolios. We also built long-term growth platforms SquareTrade\u2019s first year performance was very strong and the three factors were success we laid out when the acquisition was closed in January. Arity signed its first third party insurance customer to expand its platform outside the Allstate entities.","If you look forward to 2018 going to Slide 5, we are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth. The Property-Liability business is expected to have an annual underlying combined ratio between 86 and 88 in 2018. This range considers the impact of growth and the effect of a lower tax rate that we just discussed.","Our priorities for 2018 are consistent with 2017. So the first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns in capital and grow the customer base, those are obviously all intertwined, and ensure the corporation has multiple passed through profitable long-term growth. In 2018, Allstate brand Property-Liability, Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and Esurance are all expected to contribute to growth.","Mario will now go through Property-Liability results.","Mario Rizzo","Thanks Tom. Slide 6, shows Property-Liability results by customer segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $7.8billion, a 3.6% increase from the prior year quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 91 was 1.3 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in these results were higher catastrophe losses, increased agency and employee compensation cost as well as an increased donation to the Allstate Foundation. This was partially offset by increased premiums earned, lower underlying loss cost and higher favorable prior year reserve reestimates.","When we exclude catastrophe\u2019s and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio was 85.7 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 84.9 for the full year. The full year underlying combined ratio, as historically reported, including the Property-Liability and service businesses, was 85.6, which was below our annual outlook range of 87 to 89.","As you know, our strategy is to provide differentiated customer value propositions for the four consumer segments of the Property-Liability market. The Allstate brand in the lower left competes in the local advice and branded segment. Net written premium was 4.1% higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 4.2% increase in auto insurance premiums. The underlying combined ratio was 84.8 with the favorable prior year comparison, driven by improved loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 94.2 underlying combined ratio two points below the prior year quarter.","Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer a branded product, but are comfortable handling their own insurance fees. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance continues to improve relative to prior year and was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Esurance net written premium grew by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter.","Our strategy to broaden customer relationships is successful as homeowners insurance policies increased 36.2% in 2017 with written premium increasing 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 99.8 was 5.2 points better than the prior year quarter with improvements in both auto and homeowners insurance. Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about the brand of insurance they purchase. We continue to make progress in improving underlying margins.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 7 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the full year was 93.2, generating $1.3 billion in underwriting income in 2017. These results reflect increased average earned premium, lower frequency and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, primarily related to injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 94.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 improved by two points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by a 3.7 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The expense ratio was 26.2, 1.7 points above the prior-year quarter.","The chart on the top right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiated in the second half of 2015. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line increased by 4.5% to $1,022, while underlying loss and expense, shown by the red line increased 2.3%. This resulted in a favorable GAAP of $59 per policy compared to the low 20s experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages are shown on the bottom chart. In the fourth quarter, frequency continued to perform below the elevated levels experienced in 2015 and 2016 and favorable trends remain geographically widespread.","Slide 8 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate branded auto insurance. Starting with the graph at the top, overall, policies in force grow sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017. The bottom two charts highlight both the renewal ratio and new issued applications for Allstate branded auto insurance. The renewal ratio is a bigger influence on total policies in force, and we continue to focus on improving the customer experience. The renewal ratio of 87.8 was an improvement of 0.4 points from the prior year quarter.","New issued applications grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, increasing 10.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Executing our trusted adviser strategy, along with expanding distribution capacity and efficiency, will help build growth momentum throughout 2018.","Slide 9, shows similar information for Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results. The homeowners recorded combined ratio of 85.4 in the fourth quarter, which generated $252 million in underwriting income, as Allstate\u2019s effective risk and return management strategy drove strong performance despite significant California wildfire losses. For the full year, despite $2.1 billion in catastrophe losses, the reported combined ratio was 89.4; while underwriting income was $725 million for the year, which was a $373 million decrease relative to the prior year.","The bottom half of the page provides detail on policies in force, which declined 0.5% in 2017, but grew sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2017. The renewal ratio of 87.5 was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. New issued applications growth accelerated to 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. As auto insurance retention and new business levels have improved, we are seeing a favorable impact on homeowners policies in force.","Slide 10 provides additional financial highlights for Esurance. Esurance made progress on improving financial results and positioning the business to resume growth in total policies in force. The recorded combined ratio of 100.2 in the fourth quarter, shown on the left chart, was 4.8 points below the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a lower expense ratio. The auto underlying combined ratio for the full year was 100.2, five points below 2016 due to lower expenses. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the right-hand chart. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased average premium, while policies in force declined compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Policy growth in homeowners partially offset the decline in auto policies due to profit improvement actions.","Slide 11 provides additional highlights for Encompass. Encompass continues to improve underlying profitability, while executing growth plans and states with rate adequacy and long-term growth potential. Encompass reported combined ratio was 106.4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was impacted by significant catastrophe losses, primarily due to the California wildfires. the underlying combined ratio was 86.4 for the fourth quarter was 4.3 points lower than the prior year period due to improvement in the underlying loss ratio, partially offset by a higher expense ratio.","Shown on the right chart, Encompass net written premium declined 7.6%, and policies in force were 14.4% lower in 2017. The decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns has impacted overall top line trends.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John.","John Griek","Thanks Mario. Let\u2019s go to Slide 12, which provides detail on service businesses, a new reportable segment which offer a broad range of products and services that support our customers and enhance our customer value propositions. Our strategy to deliver superior value propositions and build strategic platforms made good progress in the fourth quarter, as policies in force grew to $43. million and revenue growth accelerated to $264 million for the quarter. Net income of $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, included a $134 million benefit from tax reform, while the adjusted net loss was $24 million in the quarter.","It its first year under Allstate ownership, SquareTrade had very strong performance and achieved the thee factors for success we identified when the acquisition closed in January. Policies in force grew to $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of $4.6 million policies compared to the third quarter. We executed a 100% quota share agreement this year with our largest third-party reinsurer, which further enhanced the economics of the business. We also continue to invest in accelerating growth, both domestically and internationally. In the fourth quarter, Arity established relationships with insurance and shared mobility companies, expanding its platform outside of Allstate entities. Allstate Roadside Services revenue declined in 2017, reflecting nonrenewal of unprofitable third- party contracts. And adjusted net loss was realized in the fourth quarter and for the year as the new digital platform, which reduces response time, is not yet profitable.","Turning to Slide 13, let\u2019s review our Allstate Financial \u2013 Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. As a reminder, these are three new segments, which were historically consolidated into our former Allstate Financial segment. Allstate Life adjusted net shown on the top left chart, was $57 million in the fourth quarter, $9 million decrease compared to the prior year quarter. This is primarily due to increased contract benefits and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premiums. Premium and contract charges, shown on the bottom left, increased 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income shown in the top middle chart on the page, was $20 million, a $3 million decrease compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher contract benefits and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premiums. Allstate Benefits continued its strong track record of year-over-year top- line growth. Premiums and contract charges, shown on the bottom middle chart, increased 8.3% in the fourth quarter, with 7.4% growth in policies in force in 2017. Allstate Annuities adjusted net income of $55 million in the quarter was an increase of $14 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher investment income on continued strong results in our performance-based investment portfolio.","Slide 14 highlights our investment results. The markets performed well in 2017, driving positive returns across essentially all asset classes, and our portfolio clearly benefited. While we participated in the market momentum, our investment strategies and risk positioning, including the shift to Performance-based contributed to our strong results. The components of net investment income are shown in the left chart. Net investment income for the fourth quarter was $913 million, 14.4% or $112 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Market- based investment income, shown in the blue, was stable. Performance-based investment income, shown in the gray, was the primary driver of the increase over 2016, generating $296 million of income in the fourth quarter.","Our performance-based investments benefited from higher balances and favorable market conditions, in addition to our performance by select investments and sales into strong markets. The components of annual total return on our diversified $83 billion portfolio are shown in the table on the right. The annual net investment income contribution to returns has been fairly consistent, while realized capital gains and losses and changes in portfolio valuations vary with market conditions, and can be either positive or negative. The contribution to total returns from the income statement and portfolio valuation are shown in the bottom rows of the table.","As we mentioned last quarter, beginning in 2018, changes in the fair value of our public equity securities will be reported as realized capital gains and losses and included in net income rather than a component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The book value of the portfolio already reflects changes in fair value. However, this accounting change will increase the variability of reported net income, but the long-term economic value creation would be unchanged. Changes in the fair value of our fixed income securities will continue to be reported as unrealized gains or losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.","Slide 15 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you can see from the box at the top, we have delivered excellent returns, increased book value and maintained a conservative financial position, while increasing shareholders\u2019 ownership in the company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.3% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 2.9 points compared to the prior year period, and book value per common share of $57.58 increased 13.4%.","We returned $1.9 billion to common shareholders in 2017. This includes repurchasing 15.8 shares of our common stock or 4.3% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. As part of our current share repurchase program, on December 8th, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $300 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. This agreement was completed on January 5, 2018, and we repurchased a total of 2.9 million shares. Additionally, we paid $525 million, in common shareholder dividends during 2017. The Board of Directors also improved, an increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.46 from $0.37, representing a 24% increase payable in cash in April 2.","And now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. First, on the outlook for the underlying combined ratio in 2018 of 86% to 88%. Clearly, a little higher than 85.6% in 2017. If I look at the midpoint, that would imply I think around $500 million of less underlying profit. Is that driven more by investments in the business relative to tax savings? Or is that more kind of the underlying profitability of the PNC business?","Tom Wilson","Good morning, Jay. First, we don\u2019t take the midpoint as the specific target we\u2019re shooting for. We just say we can be in that range. And so as you know, it varies. When we do it, we obviously look at our current results, which you mentioned. We\u2019re also looking at that feature additional investments we\u2019re making. As you know, frequency and severity can vary by a couple of percent each every year. If you just look at this year, what happen with our frequency declining or what happened in 2015 on the flip side of that. So we think this is very attractive return on capital at these levels and the best way to do is to continue to grow shareholder value to grow the top line.","Jay Gelb","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is I know you mentioned it in the release, but the effective tax reform on prior approval states for auto insurance like California, if you could give us a bit more insight on that based on the regulators comments. I think that would be helpful.","Tom Wilson","First, thank you for asking the question. It\u2019s a good question that came up in many of your analyst reports. The headline, of course, is said, we don\u2019t expect any material impact on profitability returns on a competitive position. But let me give you some context below that. Obviously, some states have more restrictive pricing regulations. And obviously, we have to fully meet their requirements. And pricing in those cases would be impacted by lower tax rate. But that\u2019s the not the complete picture, right? So the biggest component of pricing is fixed component there is loss costs., and they are not impacted by the tax rate at all. And if we just look around the industry in auto insurance, for example, you\u2019re talking 70% to 75% of premiums are in that category. And you have about another 20% to 30%, depending on the company, that shows up in expenses. And those are also are impacted by the tax rate.","So the biggest components is not impacted by that. I think people are a little confused by this letter that was put out by the Consumer Federation, which you just got bad math. So they report that it will be $25 million reduction in premiums on what\u2019s a little over $0.5 trillion of a premium. For that to be true, with this tax rate changes on the combined ratio, the combined ratio, not the loss ratio would have to be in the low \u2013 maybe even below the 70%. As far as I know, I\u2019m not seeing any industry numbers that shows combined ratio below 70%. So I think what happened is that push the people concerned about it, to the extent that lower taxes are also reinvested in the higher expenses, that\u2019s also reflected in your ratings. So what we did was we looked at the auto and homeowner pricing that looked at 300 combinations of state and companies, and we factored all that in. And we take our outlook factors all that in, great returns at that level. So we\u2019re comfortable that the tax cut give us some more opportunity to grow our business rather than have a negative impact on profitability. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays ","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like some people over kind of view the impact is it as nearly as hurtful as some people think.","Tom Wilson","I can\u2019t speak \u2013 I looked at CFA\u2019s letter, I couldn\u2019t get to their math. Maybe they have a different way to do it. But I can just tell you that when you\u2019re on, if you think of auto insurance and let\u2019s just assume you have a 5% underwriting margin, it\u2019s a little hard to turn that into 5% reduction in premiums.","Jay Gelb","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the investments that you\u2019re going to make? What exactly is going to be accelerated? And if there\u2019s any way to give us a sense of sort of a magnitude of the impact of those accelerated investments?","Matt Winter","Hey Paul, it\u2019s Matt Winter. Thanks for the question. Last quarter, before we even knew that about this, I talked about the five buckets of initiatives that we had within the Allstate brand to drive new business growth. And I\u2019ll just remind you that, that included things like increasing distribution capacity. And that is points of presence, additional EAs, additional LSPs, especially in under-penetrated areas, and we will certainly be investing in additional distribution points of presence. Some of \u2013 growing distribution points of presence has always been a great way to stimulate growth in the business. It\u2019s also expensive because they have enhanced compensation programs, and there\u2019s cost of starting those agencies. But we believe now that, that investment is a great opportunity for us. So you should expect to see that distribution capacity increase.","On the second area, I talked about was making distribution more productive and efficient through things like technology, data and analytics, improve lead generation and more sophisticated segmentation and we certainly believe we have opportunities to invest in all those areas. I would say specifically, in the technology and data analytics area, where we have made great strides. And we see a lot of opportunities for increasing fairly dramatically the productivity and efficiency of our agencies and their personnel their licensed sales professionals.","The third area I talked about was getting the distribution system more engaged and investing their own money in their businesses through redesign compensation programs and additional support and coaching. And those are already in place, and we expect our new compensation program to stimulate not only additional growth, but a deepening of the book, better customer service, better customer experience, and therefore longer tenure of customers.","The fourth area I talked about was more competitively priced than higher value products using different pricing techniques and better underwriting to improve those rates. And we see an opportunity to invest some of these money in a few areas to both improve the value of the products and ease of understanding those products and selling those products. And so we intend to use data and analytics to do a lot of pre-fill, to do some propensity modeling, to help customers understand what other customers like them tend to purchase to help them make intelligent choices about the options and features in the product. And we see a lot of our opportunity to go from just offering really solid value products to doing it in a way that is remarkably easy and effective for our customers.","And the fifth area I talked about last quarter was driving more quotes with more segment in marketing. And we certainly expect to invest some of the additional money in marketing, but it\u2019s not just throwing more money at the same marketing media. It\u2019s using increased segmentation, focusing on digital marketing capabilities, social media and some of the tools available to us now to enable us to better target their right customer for us. So there\u2019s a wealth of different ways to invest this money to stimulate growth in the business. And we believe it\u2019s a complex system. We don\u2019t believe any one single lever is ever effective in stimulating long-term growth, and we expect to pull as many levers as we possibly can to stimulate growth at the right level of margin to create long-term profitable growth.","Paul Newsome","So is it fair that sort of one, two and three and five would be something that will be show up in the expense ratio, and I guess forward show open in the loss ratio? Or be more competitive products?","Matt Winter","Well, certainly, increased investments could show up in the expense ratio, assuming you\u2019re not able to sell funding. But a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing is increasing productivity and efficiency in a way that allows us actually to improve our expense ratio and then reinvest some of those savings in othertechniques to drive growth. So some of it will potentially show up in increased expenses, but not necessarily one for one in the expense ratio and don\u2019t forget, expense ratio is just that. It\u2019s a ratio. So the more we\u2019re able to grow the denominator, the less pressure there is on the ratio itself.","As far as the loss ratio, our expectation is that we made tremendous improvement over the last several years in our ability to manage loss costs both through very good improvements in the claims operations as well as in the more sophisticated underwriting techniques and segmented rates taking. We don\u2019t expect anything that we\u2019re doing to turn any of that negative. We expect to make continued improvements on the loss ratio side.","Paul Newsome","Thank you. Congratulations on your retirement, and congratulations everybody on your new positions.","Matt Winter","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan. You question, please.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. Your ROE for 2017 of 13% is very impressive, given the elevated CAT this year. What do you view is the right ROE profile going forward, given more normalized CATs, and now you have tax reform.","Tom Wilson","Sarah, thank you for the comment on it. Yes, 13% is a good number. It should be in the low teens. You can decide where in the low teens that will be. Obviously, it varies by year and by about two of it, but I think as you point out an important fact, which is our homeowners business, the underwriting income was down about $400 million this year because of those high CATs, which was \u2013 we\u2019ve only had three years in the last 10, we spent about $3 billion. And so that had a big negative impact. And while we benefited, of course, from last level of frequency in auto insurance in the prior reserve releases that was a cost we had to overcome. It may or may not be during the future. I think the fact is with this balance we have between auto, home, investments, our life businesses and the other business we are starting, it should create overall, profitable growth and give us a good ROEs.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on U.S. tax reform. I\u2019m just a little confused by some of the comments. I guess how much of tax reform do you expect to drop to the bottom line? Because on the one hand, you say the future on filings will be impacted, but then on the other hand, you say that to be immaterial. So will that and to build that benefit drop to the bottom line?","Tom Wilson","Well \u2013 first, there\u2019s not really any specific number, right? Because you\u2019re talking about a system where there\u2019s all kinds of different components. So it\u2019s not like it just goes through. Think of taxes as expenses if you want to think about it that way. And Matt talked about how we have were cutting expenses in some areas to invest in other things like marketing and distribution. Just think of this as another expense reduction. And that\u2019s so some of it we can invest in marketing, some of it we can invest in margin. It really just depends. We\u2019re trying to toggle between maximizing shareholder value between profit and growth.","And clearly, we think that the best way to drive shareholder value in 2018 is by growing because we like where our returns are. So to accept some of it came through to the bottom line, that will be good for shareholders. We feel confident about our results, which is why we increased the dividend by 24%. I was actually kind of disappointed that none of the early stuff will regrow back to 24%. I\u2019m like, \"Hey, what happened to the dividend?\" But \u2013 so we feel good about the business and the returns that will generate.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question is on the underlying margin target. If we look at the difference between the old segmentation and the current segmentation, that was about a 70 basis point impact on 2017. So do you effectively \u2013 if we add that back then, is the 86% to 88% more or less in line with the target where you saw 2017 at the start of last year? And then combined with that, when you think about and you come to this 86% to 88% target, could you walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about the deterioration that you could see in both the underlying loss ratio or the expense ratio as you came up with that holistic number?","Mario Rizzo","So thanks, Elyse. This is Mario. So first, the 86% to 88% is a total Property-Liability number. It\u2019s not unique to anyone of the businesses. I think when you look at it compared to the 87% to 89% over a year ago, it \u2013 we do expect improvement relative to the guidance we would have given you a year ago. Some of that is because of the continued profit improvement in some of the businesses that we\u2019ve been working on profitability for the last several years. That would include Encompass and Esurance as well as our commercial business. So we factored that all in, and the outcome is the 86% to 88% that we gave you. And as Tom mentioned earlier on, we think at that level, with an outlook for accelerating growth, we can generate significant shareholder value operating the business at those levels.","Tom Wilson","Let me just make a quick comment about the frequency. So remember, in 2016, frequency jumped way up. We were all surprised. We got on it early, and we went to written prices. Previously came way down in 2017. So we haven\u2019t forgotten about that volatility when we\u2019re doing our estimates.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then I know some of the questions that are all in the call did focus on the impact of tax reform and potentially on rate filings. But maybe this a little bit backwards-looking, but the level of rate that you guys took in the fourth quarter did go up a little bit even if you exclude the rate that you \u2013 x kind of a rate increase that you guys took in California. I had thought that we might see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate level. Was there anything specific to the Q4, and just how we should be thinking about the level of rate you guys see yourself taking in 2018?","Glenn Shapiro","Elyse, this is Glenn. You\u2019re right. It was heavily influenced by California, the higher rate in the fourth quarter. And that rate is effective now and in process. So we continue to look at our rates on a state-by-state basis. And going back to the question which you went into on taxes, that the \u2013 only the profit component is impacted by the tax changes. And we look on state-by-state basis. And we have indications in states. This will be good for customers. It helps mitigate the indications, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. And we also factor in loss trend, which in and of itself is, every year, a larger factor than the tax change that we had.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. So you see yourself, I guess, similar commentary to last quarter, with a little adjustment for tax reform as more or less taking weight in line with trend?","Matt Winter","Elyse, it\u2019s Matt. Let me just add one thing. You made a comment about the deterioration in the margin that you saw in the fourth quarter. I would just encourage you to go back over the last however many years you\u2019d like to, three, five, ten years. And I think what you\u2019ll notice is that there is almost always historically an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the fourth quarter typically due to bad weather patterns that we see in fourth quarter and first quarter. And I think what you\u2019ll find is that our actual performance this last quarter from both an underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio was actually quite good. So we don\u2019t look at that as a deterioration in our underlying margin, we look at that as normal seasonality and volatility in that area.","In the expense component you also referred to, you\u2019ll also see that following really good years, you will see a spike-up in the expense ratio in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s typically due to our true-ups of our agent bonus plans and our employee incentive compensation plans. So that tends to be somewhat volatile. It\u2019s not a deterioration in our expense efficiency in the business, it\u2019s just reflecting a true-up in some things as a result of having a good year. So I would, if I were you, look at fourth quarter as a negative. In any way, we view it as a strong quarter with good strong fundamentals in both areas.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Than you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I want to go back to the guidance for the underlying combined ratio. So if we take the midpoint of that guidance, it\u2019s about 200 basis points higher than the total results for 2017. And if I understand the comments that you made on the call correctly, really a lot of the acceleration of expense initiatives would be offset by improved productivity. Some of the loss ratio increases could be offset by some of the loss control that you\u2019ve put in the last couple of years. So what would drive that 200 basis point increase? Is it basically frequency?","Tom Wilson","Well, first, let\u2019s make sure we get everyone there. So if there\u2019s still questions out here, we feel very comfortable we can be in the 86% to 88%. We\u2019ve picked a range that we feel is reasonable, one that we can live with then. We don\u2019t necessarily pick it just by the midpoint. So that\u2019s where want to be. We just said we want to be in that range. If you look at frequency last year, it was down 4% to 5%, depending on where you want to look at it. If you look at where were in 2015, you can get the same part of that. And so that translates directly almost \u2013 percentage into \u2013 it\u2019s probably about \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s \u2013 about 75% of it shows up in the combined ratio.","So you can get year-to-year swing on frequency. Just bad weather, people getting more actions, the whole with an increased miles driven, the new cell phones, what was in 2015, we know that they happened everywhere around the country. We know other people were impacted by it as well. And so I don\u2019t think anybody can really do attribution on exactly why it happened. So I would just say that it\u2019s normal volatility in there. But I think the broader message is we feel really good about where our profitability is right now, and we think the right way to drive shareholder value is through growth. And we think \u2013 so you won\u2019t see as many price increases that\u2019s come up next year because at these kind of margins, it\u2019s a very high return on required capital for us. And we can drive a lot of shareholder value by growing our business here.","You\u2019re starting to see that in the \u2013 particularly in the Allstate brand in auto insurance in the fourth quarter, which we started earlier in the year. So you\u2019re now starting to see that come through. It hasn\u2019t turned into year-over-year growth, but I believe we\u2019re headed in that direction if we can keep retention where it is, we keep driving new business. So this is about shareholder value. I think if you just want to get focused on profitability and not think about growth and shareholder value, then I would say probably the better place to go is to look at the trade-out between auto and homeowners insurance. And as I said, auto insurance profitability was up this year. If you\u2019re worried about that, look at homeowner profitability. When you add in CAT, then you get the total profitability.","We use underlying combined ratio just to give you a sense for how well do we think the business is running. It is typically a two point range. Sometimes, with one year or two years, we move to a three-point range because the market was a little more volatile, and we weren\u2019t sure how many price increases we can get. But two points is the range we think we can live with then.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could ask one more question about tax reform and the impact on the profit provision component of rate filings. So if I understand correctly, ultimately, in most cases, you actually file for a rate increase that is lower than the profit provision. Is that true? And if so, wouldn\u2019t it mean that tax reform ultimately would have very little impact on the actual ability to push forward rate increases if it were necessary?","Tom Wilson","I\u2019m not sure I was with you on file for rate increase lower than the profit provision. What do you mean by that?","Yaron Kinar","So I think in most cases, you have an indicated rate that is dependent on the profit provision.","Tom Wilson","I understand what you\u2019re saying. So first, it\u2019s just that we operate in 50 states, and each of those states has its own regulatory environment. There was a good report done, I think, earlier this week or last week on which states are in which category. And so some are very restrictive and really look tough, hardheaded. Others, it\u2019s sort of an open market and you go to compete. In those ones that are very restrictive, you have indications of rates. And sometimes, you file for the whole indication. Sometimes, you get less than that because you\u2019re in a negotiation with the regulator as to what to do.","So I would say, you\u2019re correct, and that it is a \u2013 it\u2019s more complex than, \"Oh, I\u2019m going to take your underwriting margin.\" Time has changed in tax rate and say, \"That\u2019s what happens to your premium.\" Much more complex than that. It\u2019s what we want to take, what the competitive situation is, where the regulatory environment is, where loss costs are, what trends are. It\u2019s a complicated little piece. We have 300 different companies and state combinations. And the bottom line is, we feel okay about where we\u2019re at. We think, with this tax law, it gives us an opportunity to invest in growth. We think that\u2019s really good for our shareholders. And so we\u2019re excited about this, not concerned about it.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning. And Matt Congratulations on your retirement. A quick question on looking back to 2017, if we could just have one more look at sort of your underlying combined ratio versus target, which came in a couple points better. It sounds like, in your answer to Yaron\u2019s question, frequency was a big surprise, but what else sort of surprised you about the year relative to where you were setting it up?","Matt Winter","Thanks Bob, it\u2019s Matt. Well, we\u2019ve had frequency surprise us when it\u2019s been positive, had frequency surprise us when it\u2019s been negative. The frequency improvement was due this year to a lot of the things that are external and some things that are internal. So externally, the industry has experienced a decline in frequency. And we look at it with the same level of rigor that we looked at it when it went up. So it\u2019s consistent across risk segments. It\u2019s consistent geographically across rating plans, across customer tenure and accident types. So both quality and tenure of the customers appears to not be driving that. But when we reacted to the frequency spike at the end of 2014, 2015 and early part of 2016, you recall that we took segmented rate. And because we took segmented rate, we impacted the riskier sections and segments of our book more than others. That increased defection rates of those underperforming segments. We did drive lower levels of new business that actually reduced the new business penalty.","And at the same time, we improved the rate adequacy of all the business that we drove. So it\u2019s the combination of the decline externally and some of the actions we took internally that really improved our frequency results. And you see that \u2013 if you look at fast track, you can see us following industry better than industry trends. So we\u2019ve been at least 0.5 lower than the industry for PD frequency in each of the last quarters, the last four quarters. So we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatically different than the rest of the industry, but I think we are benefiting a little better than everybody else from it.","We also, in addition to frequency, remember that there was a whole lot of good work done in the claims organization to manage severity costs and loss costs through some of the work that they did with QuickFoto Claim, enhance discipline and diligence around bodily injury requiring enhanced documentation. And things like that and the result of all of that work has resulted in an improvement in our overall underlying combined ratio. And we see nothing to indicate that, that should be different for us going forward other than normal volatility that\u2019s environmental. But internally, the same stuff that\u2019s worked for us in the past should work for us going forward.","John Griek","Jonathan we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. final question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. Thank your for fitting me on. I appreciate it. I just want to clarify, on Elyse\u2019s question, the 86% to 88% guidance compares to an 84.9% in 2017 or an 856.% in 2017?","Mario Rizzo","Josh this is Mario. The comparable number would have been the 84.9%. That\u2019s on the same basis that the 87% to 89% was established. The 86% to 88% is based on the new segments.","Joshua Shanker","And I guess, tangentially, can you tell us the difference in customer acquisition spend between 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2016, maybe that will help inform us about how much you\u2019re willing to spend on acquiring new business in 2018.","Tom Wilson","Well, we don\u2019t break \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose customer acquisition cost per policy. We obviously track it and use it. I mean, we just talk about marketing expenses. So in the fourth quarter expenses were up a little bit in part because of the foundation and the agency Matt talked about and it\u2019s probably even if you across the agency comp pressed here is probably about 7.0 point, something like that. And so we wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue at that level. That said, we are going to increase marketing in 2018 when we reposition our brand. I feel like our advertising needs to be refreshed a little bit. And so we\u2019re working on that for both the Allstate and Esurance brands. When we do that, we will invest in more marketing. What I can tell you, Josh, is that it\u2019s all economics.","So we don\u2019t spend money to drive to drive growth to lose money. We will accept a higher loss ratio on some new business until it ages out. So we can end up running a combined ratio loss business for our first year in both businesses, both Allstate and Esurance. But we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s all economic. We\u2019re all going to get quick returns on it. So the \u2013 I think the point on sort of where are you, we were down a lot in frequency in 2017. We\u2019d like to think this is a new level, and that our pricing that we\u2019ve put in place 2015 and 2016 which reflected higher frequency, was no longer necessary. And if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to offer our customers a better deal. We can capture margin and we can grow which is our shareholder value. But the fact of the matter is, you don\u2019t know. ","And so I think the message we would like you to take away from 86% to 88% is that we feel good about the business. We feel good about the profitability of the business. We have good control over the profitability of the business to react to different things that happen in the marketplace. And the best thing to do is to keep profitability in that range and grow the business as opposed to drive the profitability lower. Obviously, you could \u2013 we could have an alternative plan, which will be to driver the underlying combined ratio down further.","We do not think that\u2019s the right way to interact shareholder value and the company. We think we\u2019ve gotten ourselves through the dramatic increase in frequency in 2015 and 2016 and it\u2019s time to grow again. So let me just close by, we had \u2013 we talked and believe this is great operating results. We\u2019re positioned for growth. We have a 24% increase in the dividend and shareholders continue to get repurchased cash as well, which positions us in a positive light. And we have a bright future. So thanks very much. Have a great quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and cover a special topic. ","Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial Businesses will provide an overview of Allstate annuities and how the business has been substantially reduced in size over the last 13 years and how we have managed the remaining liabilities to maximize shareholder value. ","The special topic last quarter was about how we match capital to risk at a granular level to ensure we maximized economic returns. Our first special topic at the beginning of this year was how telematics is being utilized in auto insurance and how Arity our telematics business is a leading innovator. ","As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2, Allstate's strategy to protect people from life's uncertainties. The strategic objectives are to grow Personal Property-Liability market share and expand other protection businesses. So we start with the upper oval. The personal Property-Liability market provide consumers protection by ensuring a wide range of assets, automobiles, homes, motorcycles, boats, other personal assets and then their personal liability. ","We use highly recognized brands, sophisticated pricing, differentiated products, claim expertise and telematics to deliver unique customer value propositions. We're also building an integrated digital enterprise that were lower costs and better serve customers. As shown in the bottom oval, this strategy also includes providing consumers protection plans, life insurance, voluntary workplace benefits and identity protection. ","We also have a rapidly growing shared economy commercial insurance business that serves freight sharing companies, and our telematics provider Arity. These businesses are enhanced by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution, claims capabilities and cap on. It's not just what you see in the oval this real. So for example, we're rebranding SquareTrade products in the United States to fully utilize the Allstate name, which both leverages and expands our reach since these products are sold to major retailers.","Our claims capabilities are helping us to implement and grow the commercial insurance business with a ride sharing company. Collectively, the protection businesses in the bottom oval have a tremendous value. It can be overlooked by investors who focus only on the Property-Liability oval. This strategy creates shareholder value, customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability in a diversified business platform. ","Moving to Slide 3, we had a strong first half of the year. We made progress in all five of our 2019 operating priorities. Revenues exceeded $11 billion, with Property-Liability premium up almost $0.5 billion over last year's second quarter. The service businesses revenue was up 26.6% to over $400 million for the three months. Net income was $821 million and adjusted net income was $2.18 per share, as you can see on the chart on the bottom. ","As a result of this strong performance, we improved the 2019 Property-Liability underlying combined ratio almost by 1.5 points, which is about $500 million of underwriting income better than the original guidance. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.5% for the last 12 months. Adjusted net income return on equity is a broad measure of our overall performance and that includes investments, Allstate life, benefits, annuity and the service businesses. ","Since this represents the returns we generate an all capital, it's the best measure for our average. So as a result in 2020, we will establish long-term adjusted net income return on equity targets. Consequently, we will not use the Property-Liability underlying combined ratio to provide annual guidance on operating results, but we will continue to use it in our dialogue on it. We're making this change since we're committed to being a leader in the amount in quality of our financial disclosures to enable user sets our performance and investment potential. ","Turning to Slide 4, we made good progress in all five 2019 operating priorities. The first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base our inner trying to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as the Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved. As a result of that policy renewals increased in the Allstate and Encompass brands, which is a key driver of growth, although the increases in improvement have slowed. ","Returns remain strong which we discussed with all the businesses performing well except one portion of Allstate annuity, which Mary Jane will cover. Total policies in force now are reached 129 million, an increase of 46.8% compared to the prior year. SquareTrade policies grew 84 million reflecting the substantial expansion last August with a large US retailer. Property-Liability policies increased by 772,000 from the prior year to 333.6 million as the Allstate and Esurance brands grew 2.2% and 8.4%, respectively. ","Proactive risk and return positioning of the $86 billion investment portfolio resulted in a total returns 7% for the last 12 months and generated $942 million in net investment income for the quarter. Performance based investment income increased significantly from the first quarter of this year. Shareholder value beyond current earnings is being created to increase telematics usage and greater sophistication at Arity. SquareTrade is expanding into Europe and InfoArmor identity protection offerings are being integrated into our strategies. ","Glenn will not discuss our Property-Liability results to more detail. ","Glenn Shapiro","Thanks Tom. Moving to Slide 5, you can see that Property-Liability results remain strong. Net written premiums increased 5.9% in the second quarter for almost $1 billion through the first six months compared to prior quarter. This reflects policy growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands and higher average premium for auto and homeowners insurance claims across all three underwritten brands. As you can see in the middle of the left table, total policies in force increased 2.4% to 33.6 million. ","Moving to the bottom of that table, the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 95.8 was 1.4 points higher than prior your quarter primarily due to catastrophe losses. This was partially offset by reduction in operating expenses due to a combination of sustainable operational efficiencies achieved through focused efforts on streamlining processes and automation and lower incentive compensation given higher growth targets this year. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and priority reserved estimates was 84.3 for the first six months of 2019 below the annual guidance, which assumes higher frequency of auto insurance claims. ","Auto physical damage severities were higher than expected. However, this was offset by planned reduction and expense ratio. As a result of this performance, we're improving the guidance range by 1.5 points to 84.5 to 86.5 for the full year of 2019. This revised range assumes lower auto claims frequency and higher physical damage severity as well as investments in growth initiatives, the logic of which we'll cover on the next slide. ","Moving to the right hand table, Allstate brands auto and homeowners' insurance net written premium increased 5% and 6.5% compared to prior year quarter respectively. Auto policies in force were up 2.5% over the prior year and average premium was up 2.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Homeowners' policies increased by 1.6% and average premiums grew by 5.6% over last year. ","Esurance's auto insurance policy growth was 8.1%, which combined with average premium increases resulted in total net written premium growth of 9.6%. Encompass written premium increased 1.1%, a higher average premium more offset the decline in policy in force. On the bottom of the table, you can see the underlying combined ratios remain strong across our brands. And this strong performance means that investment and growth will increase shareholder value. ","Turning to Slide 6, investments in profitable growth are focused on Allstate brand Property-Liability insurance. Attracted margins support investment growth for five reasons. First, auto and home insurance generates very attractive returns on capital as you'll see towards the end of our prepared remarks. Allstate has earned and underwriting profit in auto and home insurance for each of the last eight years, reflecting a focus on profitability, operational excellence and timely response to external conditions. ","Current results are strong with recorded combined ratio of 93.7 in the Allstate brand of the last 12 months. Allstate has operational strengths, including pricing sophistication, branding, and with expanded total sales producers by 11% in the past two years. We also have successfully tested different combinations of growth levers in six markets over last nine months to provide us a roadmap to the best willful execution. This comprehensive program is highly targeted by geography, product and customer segment. ","We use a wide variety of tools including advertising, customer experience, initiatives, pricing sophistication, telematics and new agency technology. While we're expanding these initiatives, they won't have a significant impact on 2019 policy in force growth. Unit growth is expected to accelerate in 2020 and 2021. This will slightly increase expenses from the current lower levels and have a small impact on combined ratio. But this is factored into the improved outlook for underlying combined ratio we just discussed.","On a longer term basis, we're working to reduce other expenses that will provide us flexibility to positively impact growth and competitive position while maintaining attractive returns. As always, we'll focus on producing strong returns for our shareholders and we'll react quickly to any market conditions as they emerge. We're building off a position of operational strength to compete both with large well known competitors and smaller regional competitors to achieve our strategic objective, which is increasing market share in the Personal Property-Liability market. ","Mario will now discuss results for service businesses and investments in more detail. ","Mario Rizzo","Thanks, Glenn. Let's go to Slide 7, which provides detail on our service businesses. Consistent with the strategy to grow non Property-Liability protection businesses, the service businesses continued to rapidly grow the number of consumers protected with policies in force increasing 82.8% to 89.7 million. This is largely due to SquareTrade. We will be changing SquareTrade's branding to Allstate for domestic distribution channels, as we believe that increases sales and provides additional brand exposure without advertising investment. ","As a result of unit growth, revenues grew to $405 million as you can see from the lower left table. Adjusted net income was $16 million in the quarter shown on the lower right, $14 million improvement over the prior year quarter largely due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade. We recognized the $55 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter following our decision to phase out domestic use of the SquarTrade brand name. ","Arity continues to invest in advancing our telematics platform and had a small loss. Total mileage analyzed is now about 14 billion miles per month and captures more than 400 trips per second. Allstate roadside services revenue was $73 million for the quarter, with an adjusted net loss of $3 million, slightly better than the prior year quarter. Allstate dealer services revenue grew 14% compared to the second quarter of 2018 and adjusted net income was $7 million. InfoArmor had revenues of $23 million with over 1.2 million policies in force. The adjusted net loss of $6 million was related to growth and integration investments. ","Slide 8 highlights our investment results. Investment results were also good in the quarter as we were positioning for modest US growth by extending duration on the fixed income portfolio and appropriately matching long dated abilities with equity investments, which increased income and valuations. The portfolio generated a strong 7% return over the last 12 months, of which 2.8% was in the second quarter. Net investment income was $942 million, which included a rebound in performance based results. ","The components of total return are shown in the chart on the left. The blue bar represents net investment income, which is included in adjusted net income and has varied between 80 and 110 basis points per quarter. Net investment income contributed 3.8% to GAAP total return over the last 12 months with a stable contribution from interest income on fixed income investments and a more variable contribution from our performance based portfolio. Valuations shown in grey and red vary on quarterly basis due to investment market volatility. Since we have ample liquidity we accept this volatility as it enables us to earn a higher risk adjusted return. ","As you can see from the last two bars, portfolio valuations have been up this year, reflecting lower interest rates, tighter corporate credit spreads and higher equity market valuations. Increases in investment valuations have added 3.2% to our GAAP total return of 7% over the last 12 months. The chart at the right shows net investment income for the second quarter of $942 million, which was $118 million higher than the second quarter of 2018. Market based investment income shown in blue increased to $731 million from $696 million reflecting investment at higher new purchase yields in 2018 and a duration extension of the Property- Liabilities fixed income portfolio. ","The performance based portfolio generated investment income of $261 billion in the second quarter, which was $85 million higher than the prior year quarter reflecting strong private equity asset appreciation and gains on the sales of underlying investments. The performance based portfolio also generated $37 billion realized capital gains comparable with the prior year quarter. Our trailing 12 months performance based GAAP total return is 9.3%. ","And now Mary Jane will provide an overview of Allstate's life, benefits and annuities and a special topic on the annuities business. ","Mary Jane Fortin","Thanks Mario. Let's turn to Slide 9. Allstate life, shown on the left generated adjusted net income $68 million in the second quarter, 12 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher contract benefits. Allstate benefits adjusted net income shown in the middle chart was $37 million in the second quarter, $1 million higher than the prior year quarter as increased revenue was offset by higher operating costs and expenses. Allstate annuities on the right generated adjusted net income of $52 million in the quarter, which was 8 million higher than the second quarter of 2018 due to increased performance based investment income. ","The special topic begins on Slide 10. The annuity business grew out of a corporate strategy in the mid 90s of running into retirement savings businesses such as fixed and variable annuities. We built a broad based business and sold a wide range of annuities through six different distribution channels, banks, broker dealers, Allstate agencies, independent agencies, institutional brokers, and structured settlement brokers. In 2006, we decided to not pursue growth throughout the main areas because we did not have the festival competitive position. The highly competitive market constraint returns much liability structures that did not properly compensate for risk. ","And as a result, we began a systematic process of exiting these businesses as market conditions permitted. The variable annuity business was reinsured Prudential in 2006, which enabled us to avoid the downdraft on equity prices that began in 2008. During the financial market crisis, we continued to reduce the size of the business. We acted as a broker dealer and bank distribution channels in 2010. We stopped issuing structured settlements in 2013 and in 2014, stopped issuing all remaining annuity products from Sold Lincoln Benefit Life. You can see the impact is now on the balance sheet in the lower chart where annuity liabilities has been reduced from 75 billion to 18 billion a 76% decrease. The result is our risk return profile has significantly improved and we freed up capital. ","Also, the annuities now have two primary sources of income $7 billion of deferred annuities and $11 billion of long-term immediate annuities. We aggressively manage these businesses to maximize long-term shareholder value, even if this means that negative impacts on current county returns. And we do this in four ways; operational improvements and cost reduction, using a low risk asset liability management strategy, investing in long-term assets to generate income for long dated liabilities such as structured settlements and actively managing capital. And as a result, adjusted net income from the deferred annuities is acceptable with returns is below the middle double digits, while the immediate annuities have a lower return on capital. ","So let's go through the four approaches on Slide 11, which provides more detail on our multifaceted approach to improve the long-term economics of this business. We have decreased crediting rates given the declining interest rate environment and contractual features such as maturity dates and limitations on additional deposit that's been in force. Approximately 84% of deferred annuities were declared great contrast of crediting rates of contractual minimum. Operational enhancements, lower costs and reduced risk and include expanded use of off shoring and simplifying administrative processes. ","We are leveraging the best sources over Cali statistics available to identify the piece that wouldn't [ph] to reduce those payments. And at the same time, asset liability matching risk as a carefully controlled by positioning the portfolio so it has ample liquidity for the subsequent seven years. Expected cash requirements beyond seven years are invested in performance based assets to generate attractive risk adjusted returns for the long data structured term annuity, some of which are expected to pay out over decades. The risk and return map is laid out in the table in the middle of the slide. The table shows US corporate bond and US equity returns since 1920. And the volatility of these asset classes over different time periods is represented by the standard deviation. ","So let's start on the top line where you can see in grey, the corporate bonds at lower returns on a one year time horizon than equity. But the volatility has also been much lower. When you extend the time periods to 10 and 20 years the relative return of bonds remains significantly below that of equity. But the volatility convergence, which results in a much better risk adjusted return for equity. And as a result with a long investment horizon is a much better choice to be invested in equities, if you can handle the interim volatility, which we have done by ensuring your cash match to seven years. This investment strategy was favorable from an economic perspective requires additional regulatory capital, which negatively impacts reported financial results. ","And as a result, we actively manage capital to further improve the returns on our annuity business. Today, the NAIC equity investment capital requirements focus at short-term reservoir similar to the volatility shown in the one year column table. We are leading industry efforts with the NAIC to recognize the long-term risk reduction associated with the most balance fixed income and performance based portfolio. Utilizing horizon based investment risk metrics should right size regulatory capital requirements. And we also continue to review strategic options to reduce exposure and improve returns with the business. ","And now I'll turn it back over to Mario. ","Mario Rizzo","Thanks, Mary Jane. Let's turn to Slide 12. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital with adjusted net income return on equity 13.5% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019. The annuity segment however, generates returns that are below our cost of capital. As you can see from the table on the left, this reduced corporate returns by 3.7 points for the latest 12 month period. When you exclude the impact of annuities, Allstate's adjusted net income return on equity is currently 17.2%. ","The components of this return are shown on the right. Allstate protection generates returns in the mid to high teens, depending on the geography and product. Allstate life has consistent low teens returns. Allstate benefits is in the mid to high teens. Investments in growth are being made in the service businesses. Beginning in 2020, Allstate will establish long-term return on equity targets, replacing the focus on annual Property-Liability underlying combined ratio. This broader and longer term measure of performance will increase the operating focus on investments, life benefits and the service businesses which in total deploy more than 50% of economic capital when you include the investments back into Property-Liability business. ","Today, some of the non Property-Liability businesses such as Allstate benefits, SquareTrade and InfoArmor get limited focus from the market despite the fact that they have substantial value. Just the purchase price of SquareTrade and InfoArmor is worth approximately $5.75 per share. This measure also factors in capital management actions is highly correlated with stock price, and consistent with guidance that our peers provide. ","Slide 13 highlights the continued strength of our capital position and financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $24.5 billion at the quarter end reflects an increase of $1.35 billion over the second quarter of 2018. Book value per share increased to $67.28 or 13.7% since the second quarter of 2018, reflecting strong income generation and appreciation of the investment portfolio. We returned $664 million to common shareholders in the second quarter of 2019 through a combination of $166 million in common stock dividends and $498 million of share repurchases, which in the settlement of the accelerated share purchase program. As of June 30, there was $1.6 billion remaining on the common share repurchase program. ","Now let's open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We'd also like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners, your question please.","Gary Ransom","Yes. Good morning. I had a question on market conditions. You mentioned in the queue that advertising insurance has less favorable economics. And I wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing in shopping behavior or volume or conversion that might be causing that.","Tom Wilson","Gary, this is Tom. So we manage the \u2013 and Steve may have a point of view here as well. We manage the advertising expenses in a quite granular level down to, whether it's top of the funnel bottom of the funnel, which state, where we are at pricing, what we're doing pricing. I don't think you should take away from that comment that we're not interested in growing insurance that we don't think we have a competitive product because that advertising is not working. There's just a small blip down I think down like 4% or something like that.","Steve Shebik ","Yeah, 4%, so Gary to follow up that, what we did this year was following what Tom said, we go through our economic model, we look at where we are in terms of the market. So we had a \u2013entering the year, we had a few states where we thought we will touch and go on the profitability we want to achieve. If you notice in the second quarter auto took some reasonable rates, we took substantially more rates and property also for the first and second quarter. So we got the book, we think where the profitability going forward looks good to us. And so we think that will be a better opportunity for us to advertise and grow. It never make sense to spend money in advertising when you think if some of the larger markets you may be a little bit off the placement.","Gary Ransom ","All right, yeah, that's helpful. I was wondering if you could comment, if you're seeing anything in the Allstate brand as well, I mean, its different distribution. But is there any trends you're seeing either in shopping behavior or quoting or conversion? ","Tom Wilson","I think it'd be just \u2013 first, Gary, all the industry stuff is somewhat directional, but I don't think it's as specific as what we actually achieve on ourselves. So Glenn can talk about where we're growing, in which markets. There's \u2013 the market is slightly more competitive because people are doing the logical thing, which is if they are overpriced and are higher than we are, some of them are coming down. But that doesn't mean because the percentage change is negative that they're still cheaper than us. So it really \u2013 customers buy in dollars not in percentage change. Sometimes they shop based on percentage change. But we're seeing \u2013 there's not been a huge change in shopping behavior. Glenn, maybe you want to talk about our actual results. ","Glenn Shapiro","Yeah, I'll just add Gary that we've had good quoting. In fact our quoting has been favorable the last year. You can see that new business results over a pretty high base here, we were up slightly a tenth of a point. So we felt good about where we were there. So we're seeing still good active movement in the market as Tom said. You can look at the CTI numbers and it was near double digits 18 months ago. Now, it's under a point. So it's a relatively rate flat environment, there's been some increase in advertising by some of our competitors. ","Tom Wilson","But that said we have more points of presence now of 2500 points of presence year-over-year and the quoting activities been good. And we feel good about our ability to compete. This is mark we're excited about. Like, we think there's an opportunity to grow that's why Glenn went through the quoting more money on there to invest in it like we, we think this is a great opportunity, we're in a great returns. Our brand is hunting our pricing is good, we're ready to go.","Gary Ransom ","Thank you very much for those answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please. ","Greg Peters","Good morning. My first question, I'll focus back on Slide 12 of your investor presentation around return on equity. I was hoping maybe you could expand further on how your new approach to guidance might look. One of the concerns or issues that I imagine you're dealing with is the potential changes in the denominator book value because of the quarterly mark to market adjustments for your investment portfolio. And of course, then maybe at the end of next year, you're going to be adjusting book value for the yet to be announced adjustment related to long duration contracts in your annuity business. ","Tom Wilson","Mario can answer the second piece. Let me just give you an over \u2013 we're doing it because we think it's a better way to talk to you about how we're doing in total. As you said, when you look at just the underlying combined ratio and that becomes the whole focus of the conversation, going to focusing on and important a significant part of the business. But it's not the whole business. And it was perhaps more important when the frequency of auto actions went up in 2015 and people want to make sure we were reacting to that. So we've done that. We've been doing it for 13 years, we've always been in there, but when you step back, Greg and look at the impact on stock price, ROE is correlated to stock price. ","That's the measure we'd like to be held accountable too. We obviously manage our divine combined ratio. But if you look at underlying combined ratio, we have a very low underlying combined ratio. Other people have a higher underlying combined ratio, yet they have a higher multiple than we do. So there's not as good a correlation. So it's really about communicating to you all in the broadest way we can, there will obviously be some ups and downs as we deal with different accounting is the accounting boost and more fair value and the whole balance sheet. So that bounces around. But that's just a math and explanation issue in conversation we can have with you as to how we're doing and what we're doing. Mario, you might want to talk about the new accounting principles. ","Mario Rizzo","Yeah, sure. Good morning, Greg. So the first thing I'd say is just kind of reiterate to what Tom just said at the end. So the ROE guidance we give you will take into account not only the projected profitability of our businesses, but also the denominator to your point and the amount of capital we have to hold, which will include whatever accounting standards happen to be in place at that time. So we're going to factor both in to the guidance we give you. In terms of the long duration accounting standards, we're obviously well aware of it. The initial guidance came out in August, we've been monitoring it ever since. The Fazb [ph] just this month indicated that they may potentially be deferring implementation by a year or so, so it's still a little ways away. For us as we've been disclosing for a number of quarters now, the impact will be material in our financial statements. It'll principally impact our new segment and it'll really do it in two ways. ","The first is through updating assumptions like mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions on a regular basis and that'll affect retained earnings when we implement it. And then the ongoing impact will actually affect the income statement. The second part is re-measurement of our liabilities using a more current interest rate, as opposed to the assumptions that were put in place at the issuance of the policy. Again, that's going to impact the balance sheet through ALCI. So we're focused on it, we're looking at it and when we have something to report, we'll give you more information on that. But in the interim, the ROE guidance we give you will factor those kinds of things there. ","Greg Peters","Great, thank you for that answer, Tom and Mario, I'd like to pivot for my second question to Glen's comments around the expense ratio for the Property-Liability business. I noted with interest in your results, really the pretty big improvement in both the Allstate brand expense ratio and the Esurance expense ratio. And I think Glenn in your prepared comments you talked about maybe some headwinds or some upward pressure in the back half of the year. But maybe you could spend a minute and talk to us more about what you're doing at the organization to drive an improved efficiency in the expense ratio and what we should be thinking about that trajectory, as we look out to 2020 and beyond.","Tom Wilson","Yeah, thanks, Greg, I appreciate the question. I guess I'd reframe headwinds as opportunity because what we're looking to do is invest and grow the business, which is a great return business. So we have made some, some good structural movement on expenses and to turn that into some real tangible examples for you. Operationally, we've done some things like in automation; we're using aerial imagery and available data in the market, instead of going out and inspecting homes from an underwriting standpoint. So you can just think about the cost trade off of doing that. We have improved customer experience by providing better information up front, a streamlined on boarding process and as a result we have 20% reduction on inquiry calls. So that's great for the customer. But it costs money to answer the phone and it ends up taking our costs down. ","Our procurement team has done a really nice job of leveraging our scale, improving our contracts and what we pay third party providers. As you mentioned Esurance's expenses are down. And that's been, Steve talked about before, some on the marketing and, and acquisition side of things. So we have some sustainable components to all of that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, part of it a smaller piece of this is exact compensation, where we had higher targets this year for growth. Now you take that and if you take a small amount of that you create this virtuous cycle to where you achieve expense advantage and take a small amount of that and you invest in growth, you grow really high margin business, and it's ultimately a great win for the shareholders.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse, your question, please. ","Mike Zaremski","Hey, thanks. I have my first will be a follow up to the expense efficiencies you're speaking to. I'm curious, so the structural expense efficiencies, do you feel these are kind of Allstate competitive advantages or do you feel it's a first mover advantage and the rest of the industry is kind of moving in that direction as well over time? I feel like \u2013 it feels like it kind of humid talking about these things. For a while, it seems like it came pretty fast in terms of \u2013 into the income statement.","Tom Wilson","Mike this is Tom. I think some are advantages. I think other places we're still trying to get our expenses down to where other people are. So I don't think we're perfect by any measure. I would say in the claims area, which was not included in the expense ratio we're talking about, I believe we're ahead. If you look at what we're doing with quick photo claim, what we're doing with drones on adjusting houses, we appear to be faster and farther in integrating that into our business processes and our competitors. But I say I believe because I don't go sit in the progressive or state farm or GEICO calls franchise, when we're looking at the industry, we think we're ahead there. There's other parts where we need to get more effective and efficient. ","So you've seen that at Esurance, we brought the marketing spend down, we don't have the brain consideration for that brand yet at a point where it is efficient and effective as the GEICO brand, as they spend $1.7 billion, we spend a lot less than that. So the difference is getting smaller as we spend real dollars. But we're not where they are. So I would say that when you look first at the competitors, we're in the hunt, we're competing aggressively. But we're all working to try to reduce our expenses even better, because we can do that. So one of the things we mentioned up front is will build into integrated digital enterprise, which is about how do we use technology, data analytics and importantly process design to reduce the expenses across all of our brands. And that will lead to some additional changes in the future as we try to cut out expenses by leveraging stuff across anything would all add to that. ","Steve Shebik","I think the only thing I might say is we've mentioned advertising for Esurance; they have actually spent a lot of hard work, getting their other operating costs down. So you look they brought into about half of that decline in their expenses over the last year has been other operating expenses for you believe are sustainable, that's based on customer experience, improved digitization edition, just of the growth, you got to believe that 18 months and scaling, so we feel good, our position and the team is really focused on continuing that trend.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, that's very helpful. And my last question is, switching gears in homeowners paid claim severity is more volatile and seems like less credible than versus the same \u2013 than the auto side. Any color on how to think about what's going on with home paid claim severity given increase to 11.7% this quarter? Thanks. ","Tom Wilson","Well, you're right that it's more volatiles. Glenn can talk about what we've been doing in average price, which I think is important to recognize. But it bounces around. But over time over like, rolling 12 month period, it should work its way out. But paid claim costs a lot costs a lot more than someone running into their garage door. So it messes up the severity, so it does have \u2013 it is seasonal, but over time it does work its way out. And that's what you reflected depression. But Glenn, do you want to talk about how you're taking severity and what you're doing to maintain margin. ","Glenn Shapiro","Yeah, it's a great point; Tom's making that home unlike auto the variation in perils creates a lot of movement in that. But we look at the overall trend. If you look at homeowner over the past six years, we produced on average of 16% underwriting profit and 84 combined ratio, but last 12 months was a 98 so 2% underwriting profit. So it's volatile, we've had a lot of weather in there and we've been recognizing that and price and you can see in the year-over-year and I always go to the average premium as opposed to the filed rates because there's a material difference between those because we have inflationary factors in. Average premium is up 5.6%. So we're definitely taking weather patterns seriously. We're looking at rate and what we need to do from a pricing standpoint to make sure we continue to deliver those long-term profitable margins that you're talking about. ","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research, your question please.","Ryan Tunis ","Hey, guys good morning. I guess just taking a step back on the expense ratio. Just looking at just auto I think Allstate's always been around a 25% expense ratio company, it was about a 24 this quarter, which is clearly good. Some of your top competitors I think are around 20 or even a little bit lower than that. I'm curious Tom; do you have a number in mind for what you think Allstate could get through over the next few years on the expense ratio?","Tom Wilson","Lower is better. And we have a target, but they're not targets that we disclose. But we are working hard on things like getting great digital enterprise, using technology, putting common processes in place across all of our brands to get that down. And we're working hard. That doesn't mean Ryan, that if we see an opportunity to invest as Glenn said to get really attractive business; we're not going to do that. We will not be a slave to just getting that down. Our objective function is increase shareholder value, which is a combination of both ROE and growth. And so if we think we should invest to capture above cost of capital growth, we will do that. And we get really good returns in that business. So if you saw \u2013 is it possible that our investments in growth will go up? Yes, we said they're going to go up in the second half. It doesn't mean we're not reducing expenses that we're working hard on expenses on a whole bunch of products","Ryan Tunis ","Understood and then my follow up was on the Slide 11 ROE, on some of that new stuff. I mean, first of all, just to clarify, the ROE goal will include any type of drag that's coming from the non P&C business like the annuities like that's something that you have to \u2013 you're going to include and have to battle against.","Tom Wilson","Ryan, we'd like to get people's opinions on that as to what works for you. We know, we want to give you a ROE goal, we think it should be in total because it ties to the thing, but it came up earlier to the extent things change like the accounting for annuities and new write offs and stuff like that. We have to have a conversation with you all to say this is we think it's a better measure. And it'll give you more insights into how we're doing including your buying back stock and everything else. So we can't \u2013 we're not going to give you the underlying math around the goal that we do and we'll establish a long-term target, which we said this is where we can run the business. But there'll be a lot of dialogue about it. This is about increasing discussion and dialogue, in shifting to a better measure.","Ryan Tunis ","Understood and I agree that total ROE approach makes sense. But presumably the easiest way to improve that total ROE e would be \u2013 would seem to me to be a separation of the annuities business or at least in the immediate annuities block. And I'm just curious, are there any legal entity complications that would come with you trying to part ways with that business?","Tom Wilson","There are lots of ways to accomplish it legally. There's now of separation law that's been passed in Illinois, which gives us some additional opportunities. That may not be the first place we choose to use the separation of ROE, we have some other places we prefer to use it first. But the bigger issue on that one is finding sources of capital that believe that we do that you should invest on a long-term basis, take care of your customers and make sure that they have \u2013 they're protected, but that they get the right return. So it's a combination of \u2013 you clearly have complications of which company is embedded in. You can always use reinsurance, but then you get complications of the capital stuff that Mary Jane talked about. ","We think that the regulatory capital required to have performance space investment in long dated structured settlements is just wrong. You wouldn't invest in a pension funds like that. Nobody does and regulation supports you not doing that. And to the extent the regulation supports you being advanced, we think it's bad for policy holder, so we're just going to keep working the issue. There's no silver bullet, there was no silver bullet when we started on this. When I started in 2006, as it were just keep working. But and then on the ROE thing that may \u2013 the accounting will basically adjust to probably more than what's economic. That's not the exact way you want to get to high ROE on annuity by writing up equity. But that's what will end up happening with this principle when it gets put in place.","Ryan Tunis ","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs, your question, please.","Rob Katz ","Hey, thanks. This is Rob Katz for Yaron. So the midpoint of updated underlying combined ratio guidance has two points of deterioration compared to one half '19. So you talked about rate increases, earning in through homeowners in two half '19. And I was wondering if you could walk through the offsets. I know you mentioned potentially higher severity and of course the increased investments in future growth?","Tom Wilson","Let me first \u2013 we're in a really good return in the Property-Liability business today. The underlying combined ratios and the record a combined ratio all generate extremely high returns. And so we're quite comfortable where we're at. And so we don't see this as a waving the flag that we think profitability is going to be worse or their profitability is not going to be attractive shell. So let me start there, this is a really good business with really high returns and we like it. As it relates to the quarter by quarter stuff of \u2013 what you're comparing it \u2013 what we had versus \u2013 we kind of look at really the underlying combined ratio on a 12 month basis. You can't really look at on a quarterly basis to the bounces around a lot. And what we've said is that the reduction of the guidance from the beginning of the year, where we gave guidance, we're down now point and a half, that's worth about $0.5 billion. That's a $ 1 billion. And that is reflected back if frequency is down from last year and we're assuming frequency will state down. Severity of auto of the \u2013particularly the physical damage coverage is up versus last year and up a little more than we thought when we did the original guidance. So we factored that in. And we factored in the additional growth we're doing. So it's \u2013 we don't give the component to that by quarter and you really has we're looking at annual basis, but key message, we feel really good about profitability. We like where we're at. We don't see any big changes in the market coming whether it be frequency or severity that we haven't anticipated that go into that number.","Rob Katz ","Okay, thank you. And just switching to the investment portfolio, was the extension in duration more of a strategic decision to offset the lower yield environment?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, it's John Jablonski [ph] here. As you know we had stated that we met \u2013 we dynamically manage our portfolio. And you can see that historically, we've done a number of things to do that. When you go back a couple of years, we've built up our performance based portfolio, from time to time. We will favor one asset class versus another. More recently, we looked at potentially slowing growth in the economy in the US and around the world coupled with higher interest rates as interest rates crept up last year. And we thought that it made sense in the spirit of dynamically managing the portfolio to shift emphasis a little bit. Thankfully, we did a lot of that move, we extended duration last year, about a year between last year in the beginning of this year, and it benefited returns this year, as interest rates have fallen pretty substantially. I don't know that I would view that as really taking additional risk, it's really more balancing the portfolio more closely to our long-term, objective. ","Going forward, we've to Fed meeting today; I think there will be some interesting information come out of that. But what I can promise you is that we will work together as a team to look at where the best opportunity is across the marketplace. Just a couple of tidbits of information, a lot has been said about where interest rate is now and what does that mean, performance portfolio going forward. And I'll just remind everyone that back in 2016, the 10 year hit a 137, it's hovering a little bit above 2% right now. And in the period say that ensued past that, we were still able to return good returns in the workflow. And that comes from all the things that we've talked about historically, a good balance of different types of assets, whether its market based or performance based and in around the world and active management. ","I would also point out that this year has been it's been an attractive year for assets year to date. Only roughly 2% of the time at both the bond market and the stock market appreciate it this much if you go back 100 years. So just taking that into consideration and we're happy that we manage it dynamically. Maybe somewhat comforting news on that though, is that when you look back at those periods historically, it's not as if the bottoms dropped out in markets after that, the 12 months that have ensued after these periods, historically it's been okay in the market, so we're watching all these information leading on our team internally, leading on, our experts and expert managers to figure out the best way from here.","Rob Katz ","Awesome, that's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your question, please.","Michael Phillips ","Yeah. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks. My first question is, seems like a really basic question. So I must be missing something pretty basic. So I apologize. The goal here is to grow more, and you've got investments to make that happen. And you talk a lot about the investments around this country, so I guess, what I'm missing is, this quarter expense ratio was down because of lower incentive comp agents, which sounds like incentive comps would drive growth. So what am I missing there? Why would that come down?","Glenn Shapiro ","Yeah, Michael, this is Glenn. I would say I wouldn't lead with incentive compensation on it. I would list that somewhere down the list of things that drove the expenses. So we talked about some of the operational improvements that have been made and that has moved to expenses. But we also acknowledge that a piece of it is in management expenses \u2013 expense or management centre compensation is part of that because higher growth goals this year, but as we talked about in this call, we were working hard, we have been and we're seeing some of the things come to fruition. And we'll continue to look at expense opportunities because we consider it a virtuous cycle, you reduce expense, you invest a portion of that reduction in growth, you grow really high margin business and that's our target. ","Tom Wilson","And from a philosophy standpoint, we should do better every year. Like bank, we raised the targets and their advancement is not yet at this target, so they're not getting paid on that's like, okay. They're not dis-incentivized; they're hustling to get the higher target. So what is the fact on this give them good targets, balance targets, give them the resources to get it done. And so this is not it's not \u2013 it's not as direct to main line is choosing our [indiscernible].","Michael Phillips ","Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. I guess, on the severity, it's risen a bit and still kind of is on. Anything, do you see any impact there from \u2013 and I think this has been asked before, but maybe can you just add any updates here any impacts from competitors that may be impacting the cost of claims?","Glenn Shapiro ","So this is Glenn, Michael. Indirect, it can be in there. But we've seen a trend of increasing parts prices. Now, you start \u2013 you look at tariffs 60% of glass and it's more than half of replacement sheet metal parts, do generate out of China. So you get a significant amount of impact in that space. But parts prices have been rising for the last 10 years at a much faster rate than the price of cars. And we've talked about that in past calls, because you start getting into a math exercise where if the parts prices accelerate faster than the price of the car, therefore repair accelerates faster than the cars and more cars reach that computation level of it's not economic to repair. I mean, you have more total losses. So we continue to see that trend. As we look at the past 12 months, and I know this quarter was a bigger number in some of that to the year-over-year comparison not reflective of the absolute dollars as they move. But we've seen essentially a six ish percent trend in property damage severity compared to a long-term trend to 4%. And so as we talk about our numbers and including and the guidance that we just dropped by a point and a half, we have factored in what we believe is going to happen in the auto physical damage space going forward. So all the numbers are in there financially in terms of what you should expect to see. ","Tom Wilson","Jonathan, we'll take one more question. ","Operator","Certainly, then our final question comes in the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill, your question please.","Paul Newsome","I guess the other piece I wanted to ask.","Tom Wilson","Hey, Paul, could speak up please. We can't hear you.","Paul Newsome","My apologies, I wanted to o maybe beat the expense ratio horse just one more time. And I was hoping you can look out further into what sort of pieces you'd be looking for to moderate prospectively in terms of the expense? Is it is any sort of commission levels involved in that or is it all just operating expenses?","Tom Wilson","Well, Paul, we don't get the components out. But in total, our customers want to pay less to get more. And so what we have to do is both figure out how to use less money, but then also how to improve the customer experience. So we are, for example, Glenn has an effort going to build some integrated service capabilities, where we will move work out of agencies into centralized centers, which eventually may even actually be done not needed anymore. Because once we centralize and we can figure out how to redesign the processes to make them that needed much as we've done with as Glenn was talking about getting rid of the 20% of the inquiries. So there's a variety and so that will lower costs. At the same time, we're investing in new technology for the agencies of Allstate Advisor Pro, which enables us they have a much more wholesome, broad conversation with customers about their needs and what kind of protection they have. So it's a question of managing both the expenses down and the value. Glenn, anything you would add \u2013do you want to add anything on the great service? ","Glenn Shapiro ","Sure. I guess just the \u2013 I guess the point of detail I'll put on that if you think about our system, the value that we provide to customers, we think it's a really big differentiator as trusted advisors. We have agents across the country and people some towns that are providing them great advice on their insurance. That's the good news. The opportunity is that there's some inefficiency in providing the service in a decentralized way like that. So when you aggregate some of the transactional service components that customers don't value as much as that advice and you can do it at scale, we could take meaningful costs out of that system. So as Tom described, I think that's a great opportunity as we move forward. ","Paul Newsome","And my follow up was about maybe any update thoughts you have on M&A? And I think you obviously expand the service businesses, there's some talk of expanding the business, commercial businesses, any thoughts have updated in the M&A? ","Tom Wilson","I would say, consistent with what we talk about first \u2013 we look at stuff all the time, we're kind of sticky. And so we have to better owned, like, when we look at companies were like is there a reason for that we add value and we make this a better company. So we believe that the partnership we put together with SquareTrade has helped lead to that dramatic growth. We believe in the partnership that we're building with the InfoArmor team, where great growth is going to start selling that stuff to Allstate benefits. Its lot about distribution, we've to figure out how we get the Allstate name on it. So there's a lot of things we can \u2013 it's the middle of those ovals. That's what really, the acquisitions have to do. We don't have anything specific on the list today that doesn't \u2013 isn't consistent with the strategy. Should you talk that you had and you just talked about. So there's \u2013 well just as it comes up, you'll find us to be prudent, thoughtful. And then the other things we will do is as we've done with SquareTrade and InfoArmor, say, here's our measure of success. We acquire the company, here's the three things we think we need to do with that. And then about every six, nine months, we go through that with you and say here's how we're doing. So it's about being strategic, deploying shareholders capital well, and then being fully transparent.","Paul Newsome","Great, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.","Tom Wilson ","Thank you. So our strategy is to both grow our market share and Personal Property-Liability. We're hard at working that and then grow our other protection products, which we've had great success on this quarter and same time making sure we deliver what we need to do on our annual operating priority. So thank you. I will continue to work hard on shareholders behalf. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek","Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement, posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results.","As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","We are expanding the quarterly earnings call to not only review quarterly operating results but to highlight other value creation initiatives. Today, we will do a deeper dive on our success and using Telematics in auto insurance. ","And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well. Good morning. Thank you for joining us and stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2, Allstate continued to deliver strong operating results, while building the future. We achieved all of our five 2018 operating priorities and we generated excellent returns. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio of 85.8 for 2018 was better than the range we established with you at the beginning of the year. For 2019, the Property-Liability business is expected to have an annual underlying combined ratio between 86 and 88. ","And so, if you move down the table at the bottom, revenues excluding realized capital gains and losses were $10.4 billion for the quarter and $40.7 billion for the year, driven by increased insurance premiums in the Allstate and insurance brands. Adjusted net income was $430 million, which was a $1.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income of $2.9 billion was 15.6% higher than 2017, which reflected strong insurance margins. Net income return on equity was 10.5% and adjusted net income return on equity was 14.8%.","If you could turn to Slide 3, we delivered an all five 2018 operating priorities. The first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns and capital and grow the customer base are all intertwined, but it does ensure we have profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as a net promoter score improved across all of our major businesses. Higher customer retention across the three underwriting brands was a key driver of growth last year. ","Returns remain excellent. Property-Liability policies increased by 784,000 in 2018, which was a 2.3% increase for the Allstate brand and a 10% growth at all Esurance. When you combined that with a significant growth at SquareTrade, policies in force surpassed the $113 million in 2018. The $81 billion investment portfolio generated $3.2 billion in net investment income in 2018, which uses also slightly higher yield on a market-based portfolio in good performance-based results, which was compared to a very strong 2017.","The total portfolio return was 0.8% in 2018, reflecting the stable contribution from net investment income that was offset by lower fixed income equity values particularly at the end of the year. We also make progress in building long-term growth platforms in 2018. I'll discuss telematics next and Mario will discuss SquareTrade's performance. We also accelerated our expansion into personal identity protection with the acquisition of InfoArmor in October. These operating priorities will remain unchanged for 2019.","Before we discuss telematics, let me set the context with in our side -- within our overall strategy. So Allstate strategy is to grow by protecting people from life's uncertainty. We start with the upper oval; the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and provides protection by insuring automobiles, homes both in personal liability. We use differentiated products, sophisticated analytics, and telematics in a building in integrated digital enterprise to grow market share in this protection space. ","Our strategy also protects people from a range rather uncertainties, which are shown in the bottom oval. We leverage our brands, our customer base, investment expertise, distribution and capital. It began in 1957 with life insurance. In 1999, we acquired Allstate Benefits, which provides protection products, such as life and disability insurance to employees at the work site, that business is now four times its size from when we bought it, and it's with 4.3 million policies in force and adjusted net income of $119 million in 2018.","We purchased SquareTrade in 2017, began offering insurance to transportation Network Company last year as well, and recently closed the acquisition of InfoArmor. This strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unique growth, and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have -- a sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.","If we turn to Slide 5, this quarter, as John said, we want to highlight the value created from the use of telematics and auto insurance. So, we've been investing in telematics for almost a decade to increase auto insurance pricing sophistication, to improve the customer value proposition and leverage our capabilities in data to create a new source of growth and profit. So let's start with what we do now. We began to use telematics in auto insurance in 2010, and now have a suite of products in the market. Drivewise and DriveSense are telematics-based offerings from Allstate in insurance and represent the bulk of our proprietary connection.","These products either use a customer's mobile phone or an OBD port device, which goes up underneath the dashboard to establish a connection with the car. We launch Milewise in 2016 in two states expanded to four more states last year, which allows customers to pay for insurance by the mile. StreetWise is offered through our online insurance aggregator Answer Financial in conjunction with Arity to enable other insurance companies to benefit from telematics-based insights. Arity is a telematics service provider to Allstate in a separate from the auto insurance companies.","Moving to Slide 6. Auto insurance pricing will eventually be significantly influenced by telematics information, because it's just better than existing approaches. From a pricing standpoint, if you look at the top of that chart, auto insurance policies today are priced by who you are, such as age or gender, and where you live, which is a proxy for where you drive. For example, if your car is registered in Montana, there's a low likelihood you'll be -- commuting about from New Jersey to New York. So telematics though enables pricing to be based on how you actually drive, and telematics is also based on exactly where, when and how much you drive. ","So that leads to increase pricing accuracy, lower subsidization between risks and creates a highly personalized risk-based price.","Telematics will be required to effectively price auto insurance. Allstate is also using telematics to improve the customer experience by staying connect with customers. We provide customers with awards for safe driving, safe driving tips that can lower their premiums, decode the maintenance, light needing your car 0:02:13.0 p,9 (inaudible) you know when you have that light comes down to maintenance needed. If you have one of our OBD port devices in your car, we can tell you specifically what's wrong, how serious it is, what is your cost of repair and enable you to link to repair facility.","So given these benefits, we believe telematics will be integrated into auto insurance -- insurers business models in the future. As a result, we created Arity outside of the insurance companies to create more value for shareholders. So we turn to Slide 7. In 2015, we defined a strategic platform to help us design Allstate's business model, and you can see that in our 2015 annual report we lay that out. In a strategic platform as a system of capabilities, assets, information and shared intelligence. These platforms have tended to be broad and flexible and create multiple uses for a wide range of customers and partners. ","So in our definition, we would consider Apple, Facebook, and Amazon's Marketplace to be examples of platform businesses. Companies that control strategic platforms generate high economic returns. These returns reflect the benefits of reduced friction and cost between participant and the ability to improve returns through increased knowledge and analytics. Platforms are also rapidly scalable. The transportation system can benefit from such a platform. So telematics platform enables companies to increase your speed to market in a connected car world. ","If you want to price auto insurance with telematics you need data, which is enabled by a platform. As more companies and industry use Arity, the breadth and depth of data ensured intelligence will grow, more data and a platform allow companies to refine and customize their specific business models, their specific need. So for example, ride-sharing companies can use Arity platform enable them to select safer drivers or better manage your operations. ","It also lowers the cost of collecting information. So just like with credit scoring data, it's inefficient to have many companies collecting the same information. We decided to build Arity as a telematics platform to capture important economic benefits. It is little downside to us since we need to build these services for ourselves, because we are so far ahead of most of the industry. Today, Arity has 12.5 million active connections of which more than 1.5 million are through the Allstate entities. They analyze over 300 trips per second and create a proprietary driving score that can be used by insurers or shared mobility companies.","Arity scale continues to grow and it's now adding 10 billion miles of driving data per month. Arity generates substantial advantages for Allstate's insurance operations today, and we're actively working with other insurers to help them utilize telematics in auto insurance. We'll keep their information confidential, but all parties benefit from the network effect of a consistent and large data set. It's Arity growth that will also provide us with new sources of revenue from the transformation of the personal transportation system.","Now I'll turn it over to Mario, who will discuss our quarterly and annual results in more detail.","Mario Rizzo","Thanks Tom. On slide 8, you can see that property-liability results remain strong. Net written premium increased 6.8% in fourth quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brand. Allstate brand auto insurance net written premium grew 5.7% in 2018, reflecting a 2.7% increase in policies in force and higher average premium. ","Esurance brand net written premium grew 12.7% in 2018 and policies in force increased 10.4%. The recorded combined ratio of 97 was 6 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher homeowners insurance combined ratio, primarily from catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires. The auto insurance combined ratio remained solid and higher premiums earned and lower accident frequency more than offset higher physical damage severity. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates was 86.8 for the fourth quarter of 2018. This was 1.1 point higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to non -catastrophe weather related losses in Allstate and Encompass brand homeowners insurance.","The underlying combined ratio of 85.8 for the year was within the revised annual outlook range of 85 to 87. Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance continue to deliver attractive returns and generated underwriting income of $1.7 billion and $472 million respectively in 2018. ","Turning to slide 9, let's review Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life shown on the left generated adjusted net income of $68 million in the fourth quarter, up 19.3% from the prior year quarter as lower effective tax rate and higher premiums more than offset higher contract benefit. ","Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income shown in the middle chart was $25 million in the fourth quarter. The $5 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums in a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses.","Allstate Annuities on the right had adjusted net income of $31 million in the quarter, which was $24 million lower than the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to lower performance based investment income. ","Moving to slide 10, our Service Businesses continue to provide strategic and economic value. SquareTrade written premium increased 107.1% to $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and revenues increased to $137 million. Adjusted net income was $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Arity continues to invest and advancing our Telematics platform. In the fourth quarter, Arity had revenues of $24 million, primarily related to affiliate contracts. Allstate Dealer Services revenue was $105 million for the quarter and $403 million for the year. Adjusted net income was $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, benefiting from improved loss experience. ","Allstate Roadside Services revenue was $74 million for the quarter with an adjusted net loss of $7 million in line with the prior year quarter. InfoArmor is the newest addition to the Service Businesses segment contributing over 1 million policies in force.","Slide 11 takes a closer look at the acquisition measures of success for SquareTrade. SquareTrade is delivering on the three objectives supporting its acquisition and as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved and the businesses expanding beyond US retail. SquareTrade written premium increased 81.5% to $773 million in 2018 due to the continued growth in US retail as SquareTrade became the exclusive protection plan provider for a leading US retailer in the second half of the year. ","Adjusted net income was $23 million in 2018 reflecting full year improvement of $45 million. Slide 12 highlights our investment results. We proactively managed the investment portfolio considering market conditions, the nature of our liability and risk appetite. As a result, we have a high quality, market based investment grade bond portfolio that generates substantial annual income and cash flows. We also have a performance based equity portfolio that generate higher returns and longer dated liabilities. ","The chart at the lower left shows net investment income for the fourth quarter was $786 million, lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. Market based investment income increased and reflects higher purchase yield and a modest duration extension for the property-liability fixed income portfolio, partially offset by reduced allocation to high yield bond.","Performance based investment income generated $145 million of income in the fourth quarter. Performance based income for 2018 was solid with a yield over 9% but fourth quarter was below the prior year quarter reflecting a lower number of sales of underlying investments and more moderate asset appreciation. The components of total return are shown in the table on the right. The negative 0.2% return in the quarter includes the stable contribution from investment income, reduced by lower fixed income and equity valuation. The total return for 2018 was 0.8%.","Slide 13, provides an overview of returns and capital. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income return on equity shown on the left was 14.8% in 2018, an increase of 1.4 points compared to the prior year. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $1.2 billion to common shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total cash return to shareholders to $2.8 billion for the full year, as you can see in the chart on the right. As part of the $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in 2018, we completed the acquisitions of InfoArmor for $525 million and PlumChoice for $30 million, and redeemed $385 million of our preferred shares. We continue to take a proactive approach to managing our capital.","Now, we'll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please?","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question is -- just on the severity trends that you're seeing within your auto book, PD severity remained elevated for the second consecutive quarter. If you can just tell us, is it the same factors that you saw driving that last quarter. And then within your underlying margin guide for 2019, are you assuming that severity trends will remain elevated?","Tom Wilson","Elyse, this is Tom. So Glenn will answer for the Allstate brand, if you want to go into the other brands, let us know. And as you know, we don't give you -- we don't give breakouts -- in the underlying combined ratio guidance.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes. So, thank you, Elyse. I want to start with just a little bit of context on it, and then talk about the issue itself and actions from it. So from a context standpoint, as you know, the losses represent about 70% of the combined ratio and within those losses, because we price Allstate auto in total. You have physical damage about half of it and then you've got the injury coverage, just about half of it. And then within those, you have frequency and severity impacting each of those. So those four quadrants right now, we actually see three of them performing as expected or well, favorable severity in both injury and physical damage, and then the injury lines are performing as expected as you can see in our reserve releases. No question, there's pressure on the physical damage part of it, and they are similar trends to what we saw in the prior.","So, the issues in industry wide one, we've seen more sophisticated cars costing more to repair. And as a result of that, particularly at the high-end of repairs, more cars are then reaching sort of that capitation level of a total loss. So you'll see across industry trends, not only in the fast track numbers of overall severity up, you'll see that more cars are reaching a total loss threshold, particularly in recent model years. And I'll give you a specific example just to illustrate, because our team in claims, in our actuaries and our product folks, they do a ton of work getting deep into making model and what's driving different trends. ","So a specific example, take a Camry, which is pretty common vehicle, and we look from 2013 through 2018, what the changes were repairing the front-end impact. And the answer is in that five year window, they've doubled. It's the impact of more sophisticated cars with sensors that are actually helping us on the frequency side, but they're costing more to repair. That added $1,700 alone, just the sensors that help avoid accidents. A really specific component taking on that car specifically is the headlight. Headlight went from $360 in 2013 to over $1,900 in 2018 and I give you the specifics and example for two reason; one, is to give you an idea of what's going on and what we see and make a model.","Two, is to illustrate we do go deep on this issue and we look at it very thoughtfully. So that takes you to what you do about it. One lever is rate, which obviously we look at on market-by-market basis, where we need to take pricing. The next would be to be more sophisticated and laser focused on that rate. So how do we get better and better -- making model pricing, which we do today, specific making model pricing. But the more we learn, the deeper we go, the more sophisticated we get into specific making model pricing. And the third one would be working with OEMs and their community on improving the overall cost of repair, because as more and more cars are reaching their total loss threshold, I don't think -- there's anybody to have a sort of disposable vehicles, that in the newer model years and we want to be able to repair cars and return them to customers. ","And answer to the question about whether it's included, we absolutely include all the factors that we look at in giving guidance and it's included retroactively in all of our financials are open and are projected in there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's very helpful. And then my second question -- throughout -- very recently we've seen a whole host of transactions in the annuity space as companies have entered into deals that have helped to free-up capital, could you let us know your thoughts would Allstate be interested in entering into transaction with their annuity exposure. And if you did, if there was a transaction that was able to free-up capital, would you be more likely to use that for share repurchase or potentially, to hold on for M&A opportunities?","Tom Wilson","Well, Elyse, we obviously don't comment any transactions that people think we could show or maybe or thinking about. So I have no comment on that. What I can tell you is we've always been very aggressive about managing our capital as I'll do the second part first. So whether that's to use -- do share repurchases by companies were better owners than somebody else continue to grow our business. So that part won't change at all, as it relates to that. We have as you know; we've been working hard on improving the long-term economic returns on the annuity business, which have hurt the current book returns. ","So, specifically, for the payout annuities, which are long dated liabilities, some 20, 30, 40 years? The right way to invest behind those liabilities, much like you would have pension fund, put it mostly in equities, because once you get past 10 years, your return on equities is twice what it is in bonds and your risk is lower. So the downside to that is that the regulators require a significant capital requirement for equity because they think about the equities as being volatile on a day-to-day basis, not on a 10-year basis. So we've been working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to come up with horizon-based capital standards, particularly as it relates to equities and the payout annuity, which would free-up a tremendous amount of capital, of course that we could then use the way we -- I started to talk about. ","So we're looking at every possible way we can improve every element of our capital deployment each and every day, whether that's the annuity business using reinsurance, using preferred stock, buybacks stock. So it's just a part of life for us. So you should know, we're focused on how do we improve returns annuities and thinks that there's opportunities where we can take advantage of when we run forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your question, please.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. I'd like to dig in on Allstate brand PIFF growth. You've talked in the past about how it takes time to energize the agents, but we're now seeing more improvement and I'd like to just ask how is that growth spread among the agents. How was subset, is that subset of growing agents building throughout the past year. So maybe that's one part of the question, and another part of the question is, is there any change in the quality of your new customers, are they more bundled or as you talked about more of them using telematics in that process. So sort of two parts of the spread among the agents and then the character of the new customers?","Tom Wilson","Okay. Gary, good morning. Let me go up a minute and then come back down to Glenn, if he can answer your specific question on the agency owners, breadth of distribution what we're seeing. So obviously we have a variety of both short and long term strategies to grow and each brand is different and there are differences by geography and by component of the leverage you can have in each of those. So these growth drivers are -- customer satisfaction is up in all of our brands last year and retention is up in all of our brands last year. So that's a big driver of growth, obviously distribution is one you mentioned. There's also the level and quality of our advertising, there's the breadth of our product offering. ","And so we pursue those, all of those. So Glenn will talk about the auto home life and Allstate brand. If others want to get into Esurance, Encompass, the transportation network companies, Steve can handle that one. And Don obviously has the servicing businesses. But Glenn, why don't deal with Gary's question directly?","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, thanks, Gary. So first talking about the agents. It's really; it's a fun part of what's going on right now in terms of our growth. And it's -- I'd call it a system wide growth because you're touching on an important part because you can see the policy growth, you can see the premium growth but what's really happening underneath that is we've got 2,700 more points of sales. And new agents join us to start the -- our new sales people join an agency because they want to win. They don't start it to stay flat, they want to grow and we're attracting them because right now, we're competitive in the market. There's good health in the system as Tom said, we're retaining more customers which is helpful to the growth.","And with those additional points of contact, we have good momentum sort of built into the system and we're growing in a healthy way. And we're competitive in the market. You also asked about the new business coming in and how it's bundling and yes, by telematics. So quickly on those. Bundling has been very favorable, we're bundling more of our new business than we have historically. We also have more people buying full coverage than we've seen historically both of those are good bellwethers for the quality of business. And from a telematics standpoint, we grew that by 30% this year. We added over 300,000 connections, active connections to our Drivewise. And on the Milewise side which is the pay per mile, or Tom mentioned before. ","That's -- I think about it like a startup with small numbers but it's growing like crazy. In the fourth quarter alone, we over doubled the size of Milewise as an offering for us. So it's an exciting area where we're growing our business.","Gary Ransom","Just as a follow up, are there any areas right now where the PIFF growth is lagging, but has the potential to do better in the future?","Tom Wilson","Well, this is Tom. By any -- you mean -- I would say that the -- if you look at the Allstate brand, Glenn's got a number of strategies, different states where he thinks he can grow faster. Obviously, retention is always a benefit that we get from -- Esurance you saw 10% growth last year. So we are feeling good about that. It's back on the --again decent market share gain. Encompass less so, so that would be one where I would say we still need to come up with a sustainable growth plan that drives items in force.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. ","Greg Peters","Good morning. The first question is around the homeowners business and I was looking in your statistical supplement. I think it's page 25 where you had talk about gross claim frequency and paid claim frequency and being up almost double digit in the fourth quarter. They are actually for last couple of quarters it's been up pretty strong. But then I looked at the Allstate homeowners underlying loss ratio and improved in the fourth quarter. So I am trying to sort of bridge the gap there and understand what happened? ","Tom Wilson","Greg, good morning. Let me -- first let me again I'd like to set a little bit of context. So the Allstate brand homeowner business is very attractive for us, $7 billion of premium, made $470 million of underwriting income in a year, weather a fair amount of catastrophe. So it's a business we like and does well. Obviously, things bounce around from quarter-to-quarter and Glenn can talk about this specific question. ","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, Greg. I think there is mix there at the quarter-over-quarter versus the year-over-year change. So, yes, it did come down quarter-over -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter but year-over-year it was up a couple of points in terms of the underlying combined. But to Tom's point, in a year with a lot of catastrophes particularly in the fourth quarter, we produced our recorded combined. And I'd like to go the recorded because we are managing the overall risk over the long-term of catastrophe; it is a big part of what we do. We focus on the underlying. [933] in year that has type of catastrophes we had was pretty strong. And then you have to -- before the fourth quarter you had to go back almost seven years to have a quarter that didn't produced an underwriting profit. ","So strong work across the system which is the underwriting approach that we take. It's the pricing, the reinsurance which obviously played a part in fourth quarter for us. And our claims approach that we think ultimately get caught, part of your question relative to the underlying I would say, 2018 was an extremely wet year. I mentioned that in the third quarter, continued into the fourth a bit. It was a heavy, heavy rain year. We got some pricing for that. We reacted to it. We saw the 1.1 growth rate in the fourth quarter which is rate not premium because we do have the automatic inflationary factors in the policies as well.","Greg Peters","Thank you for that answer. And then, Tom, I know you highlighted the success of Esurance and I was looking at the underlying loss ratio and I guess it's seasonally high in the fourth quarter, but it certainly seemed to be trending up from what I used to think, it used to like to target in a low 70s. The underlying loss ratio seemed to be pushing up close to the hot now 80. I am wondering if there is anything that I should be thinking about with that loss ratio and underlying loss ratio as it relates to future growth in that business. ","Steve Shebik","So, Greg, this is Steve. You are absolutely right. Our targets have generally been we said the lower 70s or below 75 range. And for the quarter it was elevated. Couple reasons for that I think is you see one, given the growth we had in the business during 2018; we have a great portion of new customers. There is some higher loss ratio with newer customers. That's only piece of the dollar. Clearly, we have had the same type of issues in terms of severity that we talked about in the Allstate business. And you look at the opposite to that; we brought our expense ratio down, a large amount over the last three years. So in total we are actually have combined ratio on an underlying base below 100 for the whole year. ","And for all but the last quarter of the year we had good results. And starting to get profit in the business as we grow. So we feel good about the overall profitability. You are correct. We need to work harder on that --combined ratio and drive it down a little bit from where it is today. And that will accelerate our growth. We feel really good about the growth and the profitability for 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. My first question is about auto accident frequency. Can you remind us what Allstate long-term trend has been on frequency and does that differ from your estimate of 2019 frequency? And if does maybe you can talk to why?","Tom Wilson","So by long term, speaking of real long term, I am hanging around real for the long time. Mike, I have 15 plus years that just came down pretty steadily as we had third brake light on the car, antilock brakes, airbags, plus some downs so it's just worked on both frequency and severity for a long period of time. Then it kind of playing it down for a while and I am not -- I don't have the exact years in my head but it's kind of flattened out in about 10 years ago. And wasn't really going up for down much than of course in 2015 and 2016 it just fight way up.","Still unclear deck as to why that happens somewhat driven by miles -- in miles driven. Some by economic activity which is related to miles driven. There is also when people speculated it's due to like the big cell phone and stuffs like that, distract driving. I think the answer is it's really hard to get attribution as to why. Glenn talked about the decline in frequency since then which is then in part due to less miles drove but also safer cars and some of the trend that were present earlier in that long -term cycle. ","So little hard to exactly what it is, as it relates to the forecast for next year, maybe I am sure everybody has heard about this, as you know we try not to go to the component of the guidance. But we do make an estimate of what we think is likely to be and that includes some trends are just external, we don't control. So for example frequency would be one of those. We can't control whether people getting accidents or not. There are some which are partially controllable. And Glenn talked about asset severity and in physical damage or bodily injury; you can control some of that. Some of its inflation is done with the cost of parts where you can try to do a good job making sure your customers get the right amount, not too little much, not too much.","And then there are trends we create like price increases and expenses that both Glenn and Steve talked about. So when we're looking at the underlying combined ratio guidance, we look at the trends. We don't know, we can't control, we look at the ones we think we can have some influence on and then the ones we do have influence on. And then we -- as a result of that set our guidance at 86 to 88. It's obvious, of course, that's just a small part of the value created as mentioned doesn't include catastrophe losses. ","It doesn't include prior reserve changes, it doesn't include things like pension settlement charges, which I think led to some confusion in the third quarter, doesn't include investment income, doesn't include our life businesses make almost $300 million a year.","That does include Allstate benefit. So as it relates to doing projection, the business we think it's useful -- is a way to help you understand how we feel a large component of our business is operating. But I always try to caution us against thinking that is the only value creator and the only thing under which shareholders should decide is whether this is a good story or not. And the next -- it was there anything specifically on frequency in the fourth quarter that we can answer for you?","Mike Zaremski","No. I guess it just the answer was there's not really a conclusive long- term trend line to frequency, if you think I understood your answer.","Tom Wilson","I think it bounces around a lot Mike, -- what you do want to do and what we try to do is just be flexible, quick and adapt to it. So if it goes up you've got to raise prices. If it goes down, you have to make sure it goes down and then maybe you don't raise prices much and you get a little bit of retention and you've seen both of those stories in the last four years.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, great and my follow up are regarding telematics. Thanks for the information and you gave out one stat earlier on the call saying telematics Drivewise policies I think grew 30% year-on-year. Can you give us maybe some more stats or color on what the adoption rate is for telematics? And maybe how we can try to start thinking about the adoption curve longer term? How are you guys going to get these policies into the hands of your policy holders?","Tom Wilson","When Glenn gave it a number of 30% of the Allstate brand, the Esurance brand was up substantially more than 30%. They really got focused on it this year. We're finding the adoption rate to be relatively high in going up but you have to manage it. So you have to manage the initial conversation. You have to manage the onboarding and you have to manage not just the conversion rate but the retention rate, so you also have to manage the ongoing relationship. So we focus on all of those components. We've made progress on all those components in 2018.","We don't give the specific numbers out because that's just too competitive and everybody else does it. As it relates to where it can go, I think most insurers are going to include telematics, most auto insurers include telematics' pricing, and it's just way too powerful. ","It's every bit as powerful as credit was when that was adapted. So the industry is going to adapt it. We made that call when we decided to build areas of platform that we thought it just -- it's too powerful rating factor and if you go back, just the location, so if you price your auto insurance by where somebody is car's garaged, people figure that out. So they garage at one place and drive it someplace else, because it's cheaper. So not everybody does that but it leads to small inefficiencies in the market and to the extent you can be more efficient than when, where and how they drive, it can give you much better pricing. ","So it's going to happen. It's hard to tell what the adoption rate will be. But I think you could look at credit as an example and see how that rolled out in the industry over a period of time and basically almost everybody using some form of credit or some proxy for that today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question please?","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to go back to your example upon auto parts in response to Elyse's question. I think not a day passes that we see new headlines on auto tariffs and tariffs on auto parts and seems like we're getting closer to some sort of conclusions. Have your conversations internally on par with the repair shops changed and how are you thinking about in case we do see some action on that?","Tom Wilson","I'm sorry I missed the action on what? What was that I missed?","Amit Kumar","On the auto tariff discussion you had.","Tom Wilson","I'll let Glenn talk about what he's doing specifically inside the business. Obviously, tariffs on steel and to the extent parts are made of steel, becomes expensive. And that's relative to the pricing it's obviously indirect. And in terms of the cost to repair bodies -- I think it's time to actually have a conversation about the cost repair versus the cost to buy a car. And if the auto manufacturers are giving away the razor to sell the blades as a way to make profit and it shows up for individual consumers as higher insurance prices which they don't really understand because it's embedded in the fact that Glenn's example that the headlight now costs $1,900 instead of $300, my first car costs less than the $300 and certainly, I'd go and get a better one for $1,900. So I think that's an economic trend between industries that we need to sort out.","And Glenn, anything you want to say about the specific parts and body shops?","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, we work -- there's a lot of different approaches we take in our claims team does really great job working on agreed pricing with large auto body shop aggregators and there's a number of components that how they're trying to manage overall costs. Specific to the tariffs, it's something we're keeping an eye on similar to other things we look at from an inflationary standpoint. Like we look at the cost of petroleum because a lot of auto parts and certainly roofing materials and homeowner's petroleum based and we look at price of steel to Tom's point, the tariffs would be another inflationary factor we look at because about 60% of auto glass for example comes from China. And you have a significant percentage of metallic auto parts coming from China as well. So as those work through the system, that's essentially an element inflation that we watch.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's helpful. The only other question I have is just going back I guess to the discussion on pricing, if you look at Slide -- Page 22 of the stat supplement, it says 25 numbers of locations, the Allstate brand change was only 0.3% for Q4. How should we think about broadly the trajectory of rates from here into 2019 in terms of planned rate actions? Thanks.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, this is Glenn. I'll take that on that. We look at, first of all, I think setting context on it, and we had the same underlying combined ratio two years in a row. We look at our margins and we manage for an attractive return. And I think we've shown that where we went after pricing, when we had to with the frequency spike a few years ago and we showed in the fourth quarter on homeowners where we saw some trends there and had to block the pricing.","So on a state-by-state and market-by-market basis, we're going to look at the pricing and keep in mind our competitiveness, our need for rate and act accordingly with it. Where you saw the last couple of quarters with very low rate is we had taken a lot of rate a little bit ahead of the rest of the industry, following that frequency spike. And we were more rates adequate in more places. So it was reflected in good stable rate environment for our customers who help with the retention, helps with the growth. But as that turns, we will on a market-by-market basis make those decisions. ","I can't project forward obviously for you what rate we'll take but I think our history is good evidence of the fact that we'll take the rate necessary to make sure we're managing our margins appropriately.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. My first question follows up on your guidance for 2019. The range 86%- 88% exactly same as a year ago, but the operating environment a little bit different, pricing today is less than a year ago and the loss trend side frequency better today, but a severity it would be worse. So just wondering like, do you built in the same level of conservatives in the initial guidance that could still end up to be like at the lower end or better end of the guidance as we did in 2018? Or this operating environment is totally different?","Tom Wilson","Hi, obviously, you're correct in saying that. 2019 is not 2018 and it wasn't the prior 10 years or 11 years how long we've been doing this. And so we look at each year differently. We feel comfortable with 86%, 88%. I would -- there is one word you said that I don't think is accurate which is conservative. We set the range that we think we're going to be in the range. We don't set the range; we think we would be below the range. We pick a number we think is reasonable. This year we revised the range down as you pointed out after the first quarter because frequency was down so much relative to the prior year that we didn't think that we would be in the range anymore.","And obviously, we're not -- we were in the middle of the new range. But not where we said beginning of the year. And so that's one of those trends that I mentioned, you just can't forecast. Like that we have no ability to forecast frequency in total, we have our estimates. We look at our trends, Glenn goes by a number of times renewed by --looks at frequently model, make a model, he's going to organize a work on it. But if you said, do we have a solid number that goes into 88, 86 to 88, we make an estimate on that frequency and what we can manage to. ","And I think that's the other important part. We think we can manage to 86 to 88, depending on what happens in the marketplace. And we think it's in the right place to be because we're earning incredibly high or we don't -- we have very attractive returns on capital at that level. And so we should be growing the business there.","Kai Pan","That's very fair. My second question on SquareTrade. The top line growing for the full year, about 80% year-over-year in terms of region premiums. If you excluding Wal-Mart and to what's underlying growth rate has been for that business and also do you have a sort of long-term view on the profitability of the business, because I just wonder when can these rapid gross meaningful, so top line growth would translate to a matured impact on your Allstate earnings?","Tom Wilson","Well, as Mario mentioned, we set three objectives when we did the acquisition things we needed to do and that included the growth you talked about in the domestic retail business. And we've achieved all three of those objectives. Don, can give you some color on growth, the breadth of the growth as growth rate.","Don Civgin","Yes. So when you look at the full year, I mean the company obviously has been growing dramatically, part of that has been new customers as you pointed out. The part of it's been just doing a better job with the customers we have. Having them become more able to serve more of their customers. So if you look at the fourth quarter which was obviously a terrific year, there was a large component of the growth in policies that was the result of the large retailer. But even without that, we still would have had a healthy growth number, just because we're growing the existing books that we have as well.","As far as the profitability on a long-term basis, you're right. We did set as one of our measure of success, increased profitability and returns on capital. We've been very happy with the improvements we've seen. But we're trying to do it in a balanced way that builds the business for the future. Tom said in his opening comments that Allstate strategy is to grow by protecting people from life's uncertainties where trade is a key component of that because it's not just auto and home. People need to be protected by from -- it's also other things in their lives that are important. ","We could probably have made the numbers better. In fact, I know we could have made the numbers better in 2018 by skipping and not investing for the future. But I think, we're seeing the improvement in profitability in a nice balanced long -term sustainable way. Loss rates continue to perform attractively for us. We said earlier that we're going to improve our scale of expenses as we grow the business and the growth has helped us do that.","And then we brought our paper in-house. And so we're taking, we're underwriting the risk at all state, which we're obviously capable of doing which helps improve profitability as well. So I'm delighted with the profitability, improvement in profitability. But I think it's the combination of profit and growth working together that's most attractive at this point. ","Tom Wilson","And Kai, so as Don said, look, we create shareholder value by component. So you are right to ask about the components. We think about it that way but we also look in total. And to the extent we think there is another component we can grow, you can say it hurts a total a little bit. We will do it. So for example SquareTrade had really good growth in European telecom business. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning. First question is on industry pricing in auto. Are you surprised to see that rate filings aren't really showing much improvement given the severity turns second half of the year? ","Tom Wilson","Yaron, I don't know. We don't manage other people's books of business. So we try to just -- we watch what they do. There are some people they run combined ratios higher than we think we need to. We think that the economic rent you can extract in a market relative to value create one that we are very comfortable with. So if we look at our combined ratio whether that be auto or homeowners, we think it's very attractive. There are other people running combined ratios in homeowner insurance which we wouldn't do either and they are growing quite quickly. So we try to manage our own book and look to the -- I don't -- I don't think like these trends that you are seeing in severity will impact other people is our assessment. ","I can't say when and how to react to that. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Let me try little differently then. I think heading into 2018 you had said that you saw that your pricing put you now in a competitive advantage and I think that was a little bit of change from the prior few years where you had taken early pricing action. As you look at environment into 2019, how do you think of your pricing relative to the industry in auto?","Tom Wilson","Glenn can talk about how is thinking about pricing relative to auto but I want to just take it up a little bit to its both growth and profitability. And doing a better job for our customers. I think what you saw in 2018 in terms of our growth was not just pure price increases but the back add for three or four year we've been working hard on the net promoter score. And the benefits of those improvement got overshadowed by the fact that we did what you describe which was raise prices faster than other people so our retention went down. ","So if you looking at profitable growth it's both what we priced to which Glenn and I talked about, but also how much for our existing business will retain. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. ","Glenn Shapiro","I'll just add on, as we look at pricing we see competitors as you do in filings. Some are still taking some rates, others aren't. The CPI most recent number which is trailing indicator but was between 5 and 6. And it's come down from much higher than that, and is expected to continue to come down because the filings are different now than they were late 2017 and early 2018 which create that filing change CPI and auto. But the other thing I would look at is, we look at, watch the absolute price change. So we don't start with what the competitive position of particular carrier is. And now we look internally at our competitive position by market and by competitor and so somebody may take a 3% price decrease.","But if they are 10% higher than the market and they take, well, they are still higher than the market. So in an absolute level we are looking at our competitiveness on a more granular level than the price changes. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then one on capital deployment, if I can. I think you deployed well more capital than you generated in earnings. I think that's a multiyear trend that we are seeing. How sustainable is that borrowing a change in asset requirement or capital requirements by the regulators? ","Tom Wilson","Yaron, the deployment of capital, you are talking about share repurchases in comparison to earnings?","Yaron Kinar","I am talking about share repurchases, dividends, M&A, of all the development avenues. ","Tom Wilson","So first we use preferred stock to restructure some of the balance sheet. I don't think you should assume that what I heard and it might not be what you were implying were you just generating a lot of capital from the business more than you make. That's not the way we think about it. We think about deploying capital except we don't need to deploy capital, or we can get alternative capital that's cheaper than having it from our shareholders. We do that. There could be, we use a bunch of reinsurance, it could be other alternative capital. It could be preferred stock. So we are always seeking to try to optimize the return on our shareholders capital by using other capital. ","But we don't have sort of a metric that measures earnings relative to just dividends and share repurchase. So we think about it broader than that. Is that making sense, Yaron? ","Mario Rizzo","Yes. I mean the only thing I would add is we've been saying for a long time that we -- our capital position is very strong and we continue to generate capital organically. So it's not given -- we start from acquisition, trying to make individual decisions around acquisitions and buybacks. There is no formula of approaching but we still feel very good about where capital position is even after $2.8 billion that we took in our position.","Tom Wilson","Jonathan, we will take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Then our final question for the day comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question please. ","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Just a couple. It's interesting that in the past the homeowners haven't been so [Indiscernible] on an underlying basis but this year it actually was a pretty big headwind. Just curious when you think about your guidance for next year, what type of directionally what you contemplate for margins in home?","Tom Wilson","We absolutely, Ryan, we don't like to give some underlying combined ratios for the different component. But let me just maybe make a comment about the pretty big headwind. The underlying combined ratio for homeowners which is in the low 60s because there is such large amount of catastrophe that accompany that business. And as Glenn said, we manage it into total. We give you the underlying combined ratio because we can't estimate to the answers. And, yes, the underlying combined ratio was up some in 2018 versus the prior year. It still though, we are still earnings 93 combined, 893 combined ratio maybe 479 also. ","I don't know that we thought of it as a headwind. Are we taking attention to it? Yes. And Glenn can talk about the underlying combined ratio, some comments --","Glenn Shapiro","Yes. So we took it seriously. We talked about it last quarter that we were seeing more non CAT weather. And we had to look at that as we always do by market. We looked at pricing. And so you saw us react with some pricing at 1.1 in the quarter and then you annualize that. That's meaningful move on pricing. And then on top of that, that's rate we get an inflationary factor so the premium is a larger number than what you see in rate. ","We can't predict to much like and talk about frequency. We can't predict whether we are going to have another significant non-CAT weather year. We know that, we look at trends, our actual results whether you look at five year, 10 years, 15 years. The one year trend looks worse than the five which looks worse than the 10 generally. So if weather patterns are getting worse and here to stay then we are prepared to react to that with the right pricing. ","Ryan Tunis","Got you. And then on the auto side, was there a current actually true up at all there, that's slung a loss ratio one way or another on Allstate brand?","Tom Wilson","Credit or -- are you talking about prior reserve basis--","Ryan Tunis","What was like current year like, reserve release or change in the loss pack in the fourth quarter?","Tom Wilson","Well, we of course change so why don't we have John take it to that because here I would say one we think the numbers are accurately reflect what we earned in 2018. We make changes in reserve picks for the specific year in which we are operating as we go through the year. Sometimes if you make them in October or you should have made them in June then you got a little bit of catch up and I think that's what you were referring to. But it's not a significant element as it relates to the Allstate brands. Some of the smaller brands can have a little bigger quarterly swing because of those true ups but they are also brand usually big enough or it doesn't make much of a difference. So but and John can help you to sort of any additional details. ","So thank you for being on the call Allstate strategy. It's obviously to protect people from life's uncertainty. We will continue to reward shareholders by -- decide to be part of our story which is by innovating growing market share and earning attractive return. So thank you all for being on the call. Talk to you next quarter. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for us joining today for our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We will begin with some brief commentary from Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and me on our results. A question-and-answer session will follow that. Also on the call today are Don Bailey, Head of Emerging Businesses and Encompass;  Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies.","Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter 2013 and posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are available on our website.","Referring to our first slide, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from those statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. We're recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now let's begin with Tom Wilson. Tom?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning. We appreciate your interest in Allstate. I'll cover our results for the first quarter relative to our strategy and our priorities for 2013, then Bob and Steve will provide more color on the business results, investments and capital, and of course, we have our entire management team here to answer any questions you have.","First quarter operating financial results reflect our progress in executing our strategy to create both sustainable and profitable growth. As you know, Allstate's strategy is to serve the 4 unique consumer segments with competitively differentiated products and services.","So if you go to Slide 2, we show the high-level results for the 4 consumer segments. The 3 brands where we underwrite risks, that being Allstate, Encompass and Esurance, all generated net written premium growth over prior year in the first quarter, while Answer Financial grew it's non-proprietary premiums.","In the consumer segment served by the Allstate brand, that's customers that prefer local advice and presence and branded products in the lower left, units continued to decline as expected, largely reflecting efforts to improve the homeowners returns. We did have an increase over the prior year quarter in new business for standard auto. This is primarily the result of new pricing tactics and improved agency productivity. Standard auto retention also increased, and profitability remains strong as we've masked rate increases with loss-cost trends for auto and homeowners. As a result, margins stayed at levels achieved at the end of last year.","Encompass, which serves the advice-seeking, brand-neutral customers, that's in the upper left, grew net written premiums 7.2% and units 6.1% over the first quarter of 2012 on the strength of its unique package policy and increased engagement of independent agencies. Profitability is not at target levels, but reflecting the runoff of the non-package auto business. Now we also have some work to do on pricing and underwriting in packaged auto, although the combined ratio there is below 100.","Esurance, which serves the self-directed branded consumer segment, that's the lower right, continued to produce excellent growth results, with net written premiums up 30% and units up over 36% from a year ago. The combined ratio of 116.7 remains elevated, as we invest in marketing to acquire profitable lifetime value customers. These results demonstrate that our strategy of providing differentiated products and services to unique customer segments is working.","We had a solid quarter in terms of operating results, as shown on Slide 3. On a consolidated basis, we produced net income of $709 million and operating income of $647 million. Both were less than the first quarter of 2012 due to higher catastrophe losses this year. The underlying property-liability combined ratio of 87.7 was 0.4 points better than the first quarter of 2012 and slightly better than our full year 2013 outlook range of 88 to 90. Book value per diluted share increased 12.7% from a year ago. Returns on net and operating income were 11.3% and 11.9%, respectively.","Over the last earnings call, we talked about we have 5 operating priorities for 2013, as is shown on the bottom. That's grow insurance premiums, maintain auto profitability, raise returns in homeowners and annuities, proactively manage investments and reduce our cost structure. The results from the first quarter are on pace to achieve those objectives.","Now I've already covered the premium growth of property-liability. At Allstate Financial, premiums and contract charges increased 4.7% over prior year, with Allstate Benefits realizing 11.8% growth in the quarter.","We also made progress on our second goal of maintaining auto margins. The Allstate brand's standard auto combined ratio for the first quarter was 94.2. That's 1 point better than the prior year. And the underlying combined ratio was 93.5. That's 1.4 points better than the first quarter of 2012.  The overall auto combined ratio was 96.1.","We continue to raise returns from the homeowners business with an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 85.1 despite over 18 points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was improved 1.2 points year-over-year. That's the 65.8. It is pretty close to where we ended last year's fourth quarter.","Annuity returns declined in the first quarter due to reduced limited partnership income and continued low interest rates. Raising annuity returns remains a challenge, particularly given the slow interest rate environment.","Proactively managing the investment portfolio is our fourth goal. We had a total return of 1.2% for the quarter. We also sold long bonds in the property-liability portfolio to reduce our exposure to higher interest rates. Continued low interest rates and these risk reduction strategies will reduce net investment income as we move throughout the year.","We added a fifth priority this year, to reduce our cost structure. The expense ratio was up this quarter, reflecting accelerated investments in technology and a restructuring charge for future employee reductions.","Finally, there have been a couple of articles written about Lincoln Benefit Life, which comprises about 1\/3 of Allstate Financial's total reserves, and is one of several legal entities providing proprietary life and annuity products through Allstate agencies.","Lincoln Benefit also serves consumers that are advice-seeking and brand-neutral through independent agencies, which is at upper left in our 4-quadrant market segmentation. As you know and would expect, our practice is not to comment on these rumors.","Let me turn it over to Bob.","Robert Block","Thanks, Tom. In the first quarter, on a consolidated basis, we generated $709 million and $647 million in net and operating income, respectively, shown on the top of Slide 4. These results were less than the first quarter 2012, as we recorded more catastrophe losses this quarter.","Property-liability recorded $616 million in net income, $79 million less than the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the higher level of catastrophe losses this quarter. Earned premium of $6.77 billion increased 2.1% over prior year, with a recorded combined ratio of 93.2, including 5.3 points of catastrophe losses.","The $100 million increase in recorded catastrophe losses in the quarter was driven by lower favorable prior year reserve reestimates this year versus the first quarter of 2012.","The underlying combined ratio was 87.7, 0.4 point lower than the prior year and slightly less than the full year 2013 outlook of 88 to 90.","Allstate Financial net income was $146 million in first quarter 2013, up $34 million or 30.4% from prior year, as you can see on the top of the slide. This was driven by realized capital gains this year versus realized capital losses last year in the first quarter 2012.","Operating income of $144 million was slightly less than the first quarter 2012, as investment spread declined, which was partially offset by an increase in the benefit spread.","Now I'll review our performance on our operating priorities for 2013 that Tom just discussed. The first quarter saw real progress on the priority of growing insurance premiums. On Slide 5, total property-liability net written premium of $6.6 billion, grew 2.5% from the first quarter of 2012, with all the brands contributing to this positive result. Total policies in force of $32.8 million declined slightly from year-end 2012 and 0.7% from March of 2012. This figure excludes 1.1 million Good Hands Roadside members, which has almost doubled the membership as of March 2012.","Within the Allstate brand, standard auto net written premium was up 1.2%. While units declined, the rate of decline slowed in the quarter, and we experienced increases from the first quarter 2012 in new issued applications of 7.3% and retention of 0.6 point to 89.3%. We continue to seek rate changes as appropriate, introducing new pricing structures and products like Drive Wise into the marketplace. Allstate brand homeowners also recorded a small increase in net written premium, while units declined as expected, albeit at a slower rate.","Net written premium increases were recorded in our Emerging Businesses, Canada, Encompass and Esurance. Canada, Encompass and Esurance also had increases in unit growth from prior year.","We maintained auto profitability in first quarter 2013 with a standard auto recorded combined ratio of 96.1, 1.2 points better than the first quarter of 2012. This result includes all 3 brands.","On Slide 6, we provide some details for the Allstate brand's standard auto, which represents about 90% of the earned premium for this line.","The trend in gross frequencies for bodily injury and property damage are shown in the upper left. Both coverages recorded declines in the quarter from prior year. In the upper right, the trend for calendar year paid severities for bodily injury and property damage are displayed.","Property damage declined 1% year-over-year. Bodily injury increased 7.4%, a result heavily influenced by the timing of payments and geographic mix. Adjusting for these 2 factors, the underlying severity trend for bodily injury is in line with CPI growth.","When you include all the coverages in auto, the chart in the lower left shows the underlying loss trend improving from the first quarter 2012, while average earned premium continued to increase as we benefit from approved rate changes. The result was a consistently favorable combined ratio trend, shown in the lower right. We continue to successfully maintain auto profitability.","Raising returns in homeowners is an important goal.  Slide 7 provides the details on our progress in achieving this priority, specifically for Allstate brand homeowners.","The underlying combined ratio was 65.8, 1.2 points better than the prior year, with a recorded combined ratio of 85.1. Loss-cost trends remain relatively benign, with gross frequency increasing slightly, while paid severity declined. The underlying margin trends continue to improve, as shown in the chart in the lower left. The chart in the lower right shows the continued improvement in the underlying combined ratio since mid-2011. We will continue to seek rate changes as necessary, utilize underwriting techniques to improve the quality of the book, roll out the new house and home product to more markets, and broker business in higher-risk markets where appropriate.","Raising returns in annuities remains a challenge as the low investment results continue to pressure returns. Shown on Slide 8, contractholder funds declined as we continue to shift away from spread-based products. Operating income return on attributed equity for Allstate Financial declined slightly from year-end 2012 due to higher net capital levels and lower operating income. The decline in the return for immediate annuities reflects lower investment income from limited partnerships.","Now let me turn it over to Steve to talk about investments and capital.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Bob. First quarter investment results reflect strategic actions focused on balancing income, risk and return in the current low interest and uncertain economic environment.","In the first quarter, we continued rate risk reduction actions in our property-liability portfolio, maintained alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile and began repositioning our public equity portfolio from a passive to a more targeted strategy.","On Slide 9, you see the carrying value of our total portfolio ended the first quarter at $97.4 billion, a slight increase over year end.","Core debt, which includes fixed income, securities and loans, represents the vast majority of our portfolio. We continue to increase the equity and owned component of our portfolio, including limited partnerships, real estate, public equities and other alternative assets. We expect these assets to generate higher returns over time, however, earnings from these assets will be more variable on a quarterly basis.","Net investment income totaled $983 million in the first quarter, and total portfolio yield was 4.5%, representing declines from both the prior quarter and first quarter of 2012. The magnitude of the decline was mitigated somewhat by income related to bond calls and mortgage loans repaid at a premium, as well as litigation proceeds, which added an aggregate of $42 million to net investment income.","Turning to the total portfolio return chart, we had a positive return of 1.2% for the first quarter, with net investment income the primary driver. Valuation price changes contributed less than in prior year quarters, as an uptick in interest rates was substantially offset by tighter credit spreads, moderating returns on the core debt portfolio.  Equity and owned investments contributed to the total return through income from partnerships, equity dividends and increases in valuation.","Slide 10 depicts the dynamics and impact of the different investment strategies we are employing for the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial business units. As mentioned previously, during the first quarter, we continued to reduce interest rate risk in our property-liability portfolio, positioning it to be less sensitive to a rise in interest rates by targeting a shorter maturity profile. This repositioning involves shifting out of longer-term municipal and corporate bonds and shorter-term lower-yielding treasuries into intermediate-term bonds, as shown in the scheduled maturity graph in the upper right. The sale of longer-term, higher-yielding securities pulls forward future income through the realization of gains.","As you can see in the graph in the top left, the earned yield on our property-liability core debt portfolio has been declining and was 3.3% for the first quarter of 2013. The current yield on intermediate corporates, our targeted reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1.3%. Given this differential, maturity and sales activities have and will continue to result in a decline in net investment income for core debt.","For Allstate Financial, you can see at the bottom of the page that both net investment income and the portfolio have declined as a result of the managed reduction of spread-based liabilities. The majority of investment cash flows have been used to fund liability outflows rather than being reinvested, so the portfolio yield has not been impacted as much as with the property-liability portfolio. Future investment income will depend on the pace of the liability outflows and reinvestment activity.","Looking forward, there are 3 factors influencing our investment income, arising from the market environment and investment strategies we have put in place since the financial crisis. First, the yield on our core debt portfolio. This is trending down as proceeds from maturities and the shortening of the property-liability maturity profile are reinvested at current lower rates. Second, income related to market refinancing activity, such as bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments, as well as litigation settlements, may be significantly lower or may not recur in the future. And third, limited partnership investments, which offer attractive long-term returns, will have income which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.","For the first quarter, income on the core debt portfolio continued to decline as we expected, given maturities and rate risk reduction, while the other 2 items were at the high end of recent quarterly experience. To provide a better understanding of these trends, we added analysis on Pages 42 and 47 to the investor supplement to create more transparency of our investment results.","Slide 11 shows our capital position at the end of the first quarter of 2013. We remain in a strong capital position, with shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion comparable to year-end 2012. Statutory surplus remained at $17.2 billion, and deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $2.7 billion. Our book value per diluted share increased 12.7% from March 2012 and 2.5% from year-end 2012. We repurchased 14.3 million shares of our stock in the quarter, 5.1 million shares in the open market and 9.2 million shares under a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We have $1.33 billion remaining in our share repurchase programs.","Our operating ROE was 11.9% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6.9 points from a year ago but down 0.5 point from year end. The drop from the year end reflects both higher average capital and a lower first quarter operating income compared to first quarter last year.","We're off to a good start in 2013. Our first quarter results are solid, and we continue to execute effectively on our consumer-focused strategy and our 2013 operating priorities.","Now let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For the underlying combined ratio of 87.7 in the first quarter, already being below or better than the outlook for the full year '13, is there any reason that you think that that's not able to continue?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, this is Tom. We still feel comfortable with 88 to 90. That's a full year number. That's one quarter. A lot of the quarters bounce around just because of weather, but we're still comfortable with 88 to 90.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to the contribution from investment income. On Slide 10 of the presentation, I know there were a couple potential onetime items in there, including bond call premiums. It will be helpful from our perspective to get what you view as sort of the run rate of the property-liability and Allstate Financial quarterly investment income.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, let me make a couple of comments about the run rate, and then Steve and Judy might want to jump in. First, we prefer not to give sort of line-by-line projections for the P&L, although I recognize that this is a more difficult one in this environment to get your arms around, particularly as you look at this quarter. So as you pointed out, we had a couple of things. Some of it is prepays, which are a little hard to forecast by its own [ph] . But we also had some litigation settlements. You might remember, about 1.5 years ago, we made a little bit of press by filing suits against a number of issuers of mortgage-backed securities, and we've started to settle some of those. So those really are truly nonrecurring and really reflect just an offset to losses we had in prior years. And then limited partnership returns bounce around. And Steve or Judy, you might want to talk about limited partnership returns and then what's happening with the core portfolio.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So Jay, we did -- as Steve said, we did have the 2 pages in the sup, and I think that those will be helpful in terms of distinguishing between the core portfolio and the equity portfolio, so you could see on that page what's happened in both. I think it's key to see that as we reinvested in the lower rates, done the risk reduction in the property-liability portfolio for interest rates, that the core earnings on that portfolio, the core yield has come down and will continue to come down. As Steve mentioned, the differential between the core portfolio yield and what we're reinvesting at is about 200 basis points, so that will continue to happen. I think it's also helpful to look at the upper right-hand side of Page 10 of the presentation that Steve just went through, and it goes through the progress that we've made in the risk reductions. And I think that also helps give you an indication of what we've done so far. And as we've said, we're going to continue to sell some longer-dated maturity securities and reinvest in the intermediate portion of the curve.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess as a follow-up to the last question, so I think I heard Steve mention a 1.3% new money yield on the core debt portfolio in the property-liability portfolio. If I heard that correctly, then what do you guys think about the new money rates for the Allstate Financial core debt portfolio?","Judith Pepple Greffin","So for Allstate Financial, it's a little bit different because we're managing to match the liabilities, and there, we're -- in that portfolio, it's more of a 7- to 10-year proxy. So on property-liability, we gave you a 3- to 5-year proxy, and on Allstate Financial, it's 7 to 10.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. Okay. Now I have a couple questions about the capital backing the life insurance subsidiaries. I noticed the RBC ratio at year-end 2012 was up to the higher 300s from the previous year. I was curious if we should expect any dividends out from there. And I also noticed in the 10-Q, some talk about a $500 million advance between the subsidiary and the holdco.","Thomas J. Wilson","First, you remember, we did put a bunch of money into the life insurance company over the last couple of years, and their goal is to return some of that money to us. Some of that will come through surplus notes. Some of it we'd like to come through dividends, and we have to work through some statutory accounting issues to get that done. So the intercompany loan was really just a way for us to get higher returns on $500 million of capital. It wasn't needed for capital purposes. It wasn't -- it was simply a way for us to move money into a better-returning asset, that's all.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And will you be able to tell us how much capital is backing the spread-based annuities books?","Thomas J. Wilson","There should be some attributed equity in the investor supplement, Mike.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, if I can slip one in, a lot of disclosure on the reinsurance program. Is the -- it sounds like you guys are expecting lower reinsurance costs for the year if I'm correct. Are you basically buying less coverage because there's less exposure, or you're taking on more -- a little more risk?","Samuel H. Pilch","This is Sam Pilch. In the 10-Q, we explained several things that's going in on with respect to the placement of our reinsurance and the effect on costs. First thing was we did -- we no longer needed to place a second [ph]  layer, which we did last year. And the reason for that is that we were able to achieve our targeted risk retention goals without that layer. Secondly, the benefit of the cap bond placement helped to reduce the costs. We also are expecting that we're going to place a smaller program in Florida. We'll be doing that later in the quarter. That will reduce our total cost. And then finally, the year-to-year pricing on the program has come down. So those are the 4 reasons that we cited.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, I guess. First off, on the homeowners line, I guess a question of how much rate are you getting right now? If you could just kind of ballpark it. I'm just wondering, when should we start to see that translate into premium growth? We've talked in the past about derisking efforts there. Can we revisit where that is and when we feel like you're comfortable with the book you have, and then it's just about growing top line or pushing rate through on the retained book? And just one follow-up.","Matthew E. Winter","Hey, Michael, it's Matt Winter. You had a couple of questions embedded in there. So at a high level, let me start with where we are in the homeowners book. We have done a substantial amount of work on improving the profitability and returns of that business. We now have house and home in just about 22 states, making it available to just over half of the U.S. population. That product goes in immediately rate-adequate. We've also had rating actions, and if you look in the sup, I believe it's Pages 14 and 25 in the sup, you can see the history of our rate-taking actions. It has slowed. It has slowed in the last couple of quarters as we get closer to being rate-adequate. We're not quite done. And we're addressing it not just through rate, but through some continued underwriting actions. So although the vast majority of the nonrenewals and the reinspection program has had its impact, there is still some additional work to do. As you noticed, while we've been doing that, we've managed to ramp up new business, so new business is up just about 12% in the quarter, and that's continued improvement over the second half of 2012. We were about flat in the third quarter of '12. Fourth quarter, we were about 5.8% up in new business and this year, 11.9%. And we're actually growing new business in 33 states compared to 14 a year ago. Retention takes a little longer to work on, given the fact that these are 12-month policies and given the fact that some of the profitability and rating actions and underwriting actions have an impact, some collateral damage on retention, and so that hasn't moved as quickly as new business. We're hoping that as rating actions and underwriting actions soften and as we get closer to the final point of our profitability, the retention will start to pick up. We have a huge amount of effort underway on customer experience and retention. We know it's a key lever not only in the homeowners business, but also in the auto business. So the short answer to your question is we're not done yet with all the profitability actions, but we have made substantial progress, and we're trying to coordinate the turn by getting new business ramped up quickly. So as we get more rate-adequate and as the underwriting actions soften and decrease, we'll be in a great position to start growing.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Tom, you mentioned the expense ratio upfront. I mean, you talked about some restructuring actions. Can you give us a little more detail on how to think about the year-over-year and what aspects of the expense ratio are more go-forward?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, you have to break the expense ratio into a bunch of different pieces, right? So there's the Allstate brand expense ratio, which is that which we deploy in that lower left-hand quadrant. That was up a little bit, but we got a little ahead on technology spend. I would expect that to come down a little bit as we move through the year. Esurance expense ratio is high, and it stays high as long as we think the acquisition costs are better or a good trade for the lifetime value of the policy. But in general, we're looking at just about everything we have to try to reduce costs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the Q, you mentioned a change in compensation structure for agents' bonus and commission. Can you elaborate a bit on that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Sure. Matt can talk about that. I may put it in a broad multiyear context, and Matt can talk specifically about that. Over the last 3 years, we've been working hard to strengthen our Allstate agencies and the distribution platform, and we did it at a time when we knew that we'd be backing off some on volumes because of what we were doing in the homeowners business. So we've done everything from change performance standards and work with those agencies who are not going to be successful to leave the system, to helping those successful agencies buy other agencies and build those agencies up, to deploying technology for them, to changing the compensation structure so that it aligned with our customer-focused strategy. So it's been a multiyear effort, and we feel good about where it's coming out. They were obviously -- anytime you make that broad and deep a change, it takes -- there's a few bumps in the road. Matt can talk specifically about the compensation program.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. As Tom mentioned, so we had a fairly substantial set of changes in our overall agents' compensation program. We implemented a variable compensation piece. We implemented a new annual bonus structure, and we implemented a set of measures designed to create a different type of an agency system consistent with our new customer value proposition. So rather than being single-product-focused, it is now more representative of the type of customer experience we'd like our agencies to provide, so they will get compensated better when they sell the full portfolio of products. When they pay attention to household bundling and household penetration, when they pay attention to customer experience and achieve great customer experience, they have compensation incentives in place for that, and their representation of the brand, all the way from physical presence of their agencies to their level of continuing education and their representation of multiple products. So this past year was really the first full year of implementation for both the variable comp piece and the annual bonus piece. It appears to be doing what we wanted it to do. It's driving the behaviors we want. We were surprised, and pleasantly surprised to see the success of most of our agencies in making that turn. It's really difficult to respond to a new compensation system when you're running a small business and you've built cash flow projections in your business plan in a certain way. But I think our agency owners did a phenomenal job adapting to the new system, reorienting their business, redoing their business plans, and they maximized their compensation and did exceptionally well last year. And so any reference you may have seen may have been to the fact that we had a good payout last year on the annual bonus, and we have a high percentage of people making the variable comp and, in fact, a substantial percentage making more now as a result of enhanced customer experience.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I appreciate the increased disclosure on Slide 47, but I'm going to be greedy and ask for a little bit more transparency. On partnerships, my understanding is that you have a 1-quarter lag, so the good, strong stock market in Q1 is likely going to provide a headwind into Q2. And I'm just wondering how we should think about the mix of partnership assets and if there's a macro portfolio we should look at and an overall core to the strategy of what you're trying to do with your partnership investing.","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, this is Tom. You've always been known to ask for more, and Judy's will attempt to give that to you.","Judith Pepple Greffin","Thanks, Tom. So Bob, in the limited partnership results, there are a couple of things. First of all, there are private equity, traditional private equity returns, and you can look at that and see some correlation to the broader S&P and you can apply a beta to that. And you're right. When they -- we do report on a quarter lag and when the S&P does well, those valuations tend to do well. The second piece is real estate, which is a little bit tougher to align to the S&P, but it also tends to do well in this type of environment with lower rates and a lot of demand for real estate. The third piece, which has come down significantly over the past couple of years, is our hedge fund exposure, which is almost nonexistent at this point. So we basically replaced that with private equity and private real estate, and we're also looking at increasing our investments in infrastructure and real assets. That's a little bit slower than we'd like because a lot of people are looking for those types of assets, but we still think that those offer value as well.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Anything unusual in the expense ratio that's bumped up? Is there more advertise spend, or is that a trend line we can expect to continue? Perhaps, it's Esurance in the mix.","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, the only thing that's unusual, our technology expenses were a little ahead of plan in the first quarter and we took a charge for our future employee reductions.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Any sense on how many bps above normal those things represent?","Thomas J. Wilson","We're not going to give that out, no.","Operator","Our next question is from Gregory Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on Glass' question regarding the limited partnerships. You guys, I think, have some footnotes in the supplement that talk about, about $2 billion of commitments or future  -- anticipated future purchases of limited partnerships. First off is -- I mean, am I reading that footnote correctly? And then what is the timing around that? And that represents a 40% increase in the LP allocation. So how is that going to impact just net investment income dollars going forward for the corporation?","Thomas J. Wilson","Greg, this is Tom. Judy will give you the specifics. But remember, those commitments, we sign up to a fund, and those commitments are drawn down, as you would expect, over a long period of time. And at the same time, as those commitments are being drawn down, we're getting cash from our existing investments.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So it is about $2 billion, and about $1 billion of it is set aside for Allstate Protection or the property-liability business and about $1 billion for Allstate Financial. And as Tom said, it's just a drawdown over several years versus the commitment. And what we find is, though, that it's not a dollar-per-dollar increase with what we currently have, because what we currently have will pay down over time as well. So by the time we fund those other investments in our current portfolio, they'll likely have already been realized.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, folks. So it's not going to be a 40% jump in this part of the portfolio. It's going to be much smaller given what you just said.","Judith Pepple Greffin","I guess I would say that we are trying to grow this part of the portfolio, yet the 40% likely won't happen because of what I just talked about.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect. Okay, great. And then last is just you had mentioned you want to own some more infrastructure and real assets. Should we think about this as a pro rata slice of the existing allocation, or is it all maybe going towards that or the infrastructure funds or something else?","Judith Pepple Greffin","There again, we're trying to grow it, as I said, but it's more difficult because there's lots of demand for those assets. So it's not -- we continue to allocate it to private equity and real estate as well, so pro rata is not too far off with the way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I guess my first, Tom, is I know there's been a lot focus on the homeowners improvement, but arguably, the auto progress has been just as impressive, given many of your peers have struggled to maintain margins as severity spiked, and you've been able to improve it. I mean, I know you've talked a little bit about it in the past, can you just give a little more color? I mean, do you feel -- what sort of gives you confidence that you can maintain auto margins if severity remains elevated at these levels?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, first, thank you for the recognition. Matt's smiling quite broadly here. We think we're pretty good at the auto business. We pay a lot of attention to it. We have a culture and a set of operating practices and organization structures that ensure that, that keeps going, so we're a little paranoid about it. Matt can talk specifically about some of the underlying trends in the big states and the things that he's watching, to give you a sense for sustainability. But I would say that it is a -- as you know, one of our core objectives has always been to maintain auto profitability while we start to get the business growing again.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. It's Matt. Thank you both for the question and for the comment. As Tom said, a lot of our ability to manage this has to do with the systems we've set up and have been set up over the years here, to be very proactive in the auto business and watch emerging trends. A lot of that has to do with a fairly decentralized product organization that is focused down at the substate level on geographies and local markets to watch emerging trends. And a lot of it also has to do with the feedback loop with our claims organization to product, where the claims personnel are really monitoring trends very quickly, reporting on them and enabling us to stay out in front of it. We see that most evidently in some of the larger states. You see what's happening to New York and Florida. We feel pretty good about what's happened there. We've done -- that team has done a phenomenal job paying attention in very, very difficult environments, as you're aware. And we manage the loss ratios both holistically and by individual component. So it's easy to get trapped in either of the 2, either looking at loss ratio and not looking at the individual components, or getting so focused on BI paid severity or PD paid severity that you don't look at the overall context and the overall loss ratio. And so we've set up a structure where we're looking at it in multi-dimensions. And we're watching the emerging trends, and we're trying to stay ahead of our loss trends. Yet, at the same time, we're very focused on optimizing between growth and profitability. We think that we're seeing some really encouraging trends on the growth side. We have -- we saw some great overall growth in new business. This year, we -- this quarter, we had 29 states showing positive growth in the quarter, where -- the retention is also up, with about 32 states improved in the first quarter. So the more we focus on our ability to maintain our existing customers and improve their customer experience and get the new business engine growing again, while we maintain the profitability awareness and focus, we think it's setting the stage for a dynamic business.","Thomas J. Wilson","So we have the same culture in the other businesses that's executed a little differently. So if I could get Don Bailey to talk about Encompass and Don Civgin to talk about Esurance.","Donald J. Bailey","Particularly on the growth side, Tom?","Thomas J. Wilson","No, on the combined ratio in auto insurance.","Donald J. Bailey","The combined ratio. So on the auto combined piece -- this is Don Bailey on Encompass. If you look at our overall plan for Encompass, you can see sustained growth on a top line basis, which we're excited about. As Tom said in his opening comments, we're not where we need to be from a profitability perspective. If you break down the auto piece of that for us, what you'll note is that our packaged auto business represents about 73% of the total gross premium we've got in that space, and the segment business, the monoline auto is about 27%. The profitability pressures we have are clearly in the monoline segment auto space. Our packaged auto business operates below 100, as Tom said. From a growth perspective, we are significantly growing the packaged auto piece of what we do, and we are significantly shrinking that piece of it that is monoline. So we've got a plan for profitability in the auto space. In Encompass, we're executing that plan, and we're getting there as quickly as we responsibly can.","Don Civgin","And then as it relates to Esurance, we've owned Esurance for about 1.5 years now, feel really good about where we are with them. Not only are they living into the strategy of serving their unique customer with unique products and services, but they're generating strong growth with the PIP up about 36% over last year and the premiums up over 30%. The combined ratio is high. We expected that. We're okay with it. We have had a lot of work done with respect to making sure their loss ratios are in line, and you can see that coming down from where it's been running over the back half of last year. So we feel good about that and confident that, that will be a strong contributor in the future. And then -- and we've discussed before, their advertising model is different. So because they are growing so fast and spending a lot of money on advertising, we are forced to expense that upfront, which makes their short-term loss ratio, GAAP loss ratio look quite high. We are running this on an economic basis, so we look at the lifetime economic combined ratio, which we monitor continuously. We feel good that we're writing profitable business. GAAP results tend to skew that, so it'll look less profitable at the beginning and more profitable in the future. And in a high-growth environment, that doesn't look as attractive. But we're feeling good about the business they're writing. We love the fact that it's growing, and as I said, at the end of the day, it's fulfilling its strategic objective.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","That was all exceptionally helpful. I could probably ask about 6 follow-ups, but I'll limit myself to 1. Matt, on the growth in new business you mentioned, can you just give us any more color as far as -- I know, you talked about states and so forth, but is there any -- is it certain types of customers that are growing differently than another or certain risk characteristics or is it monoline versus bundled, any kind of maybe customer segment that's leading that a little bit more than others?","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Well, remember, I talked about, at probably the last 2 earnings calls, about 2 initiatives that we had underway with the auto business, that we've termed price optimization and broadening the target. And essentially, what the intent of both of those initiatives was to do was to slightly expand our target market. We had been very selective in our target market, but we were -- we had a very attractive rate for a fairly small group of people, and we wanted to, consistent with our risk profile and our underwriting rigor, expand that a little bit. And so we have broadened that target market a little bit, still well within what we believe is the preferred type of risk that we want as a company. And consistent with that and some of the cross-line sales and discounts for multiline, we are seeing a broadening of that target. We're seeing a larger group of people who are finding us attractive. They tend to be very profitable. They tend to bring a need for other products with them. It's a pretty broad-based improvement, and what's interesting is that the new business trends that are up and the retention trends that are up, are up in those states where we have implemented those 2 initiatives, the price optimization and broadening the target. So we're seeing them provide the lift that we expected, and we're seeing that continue to roll out as we finish installing those tweaks to the rating plan across the country. So overall, it's a slight broadening, not in a dramatically different market, but a disciplined move to expand our target market to include a greater percentage of people who shop with us.","Thomas J. Wilson","To all of our participants, I know it's a busy day for you. We got a number people with questions, so if you could give us your most important question, we'll then commit to try to get through as many of these as we can.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the change in the compensation structure for the agencies. If I recall, that did result in a few agents leaving. Just curious where we are in the process. Are we seeing the pace of agents leaving decline?","Thomas J. Wilson","Vinay, this is Tom Wilson. I'm not sure I agree with your premise that people left because of the compensation program. People choose their -- where they will put their professional efforts based on what they think their ability to succeed is. Obviously, that includes compensation, but it also includes their own skills, capabilities and their own view of what they want to do in their lives. So I wouldn't attribute the decline in agencies to the compensation plan. I would say that our agencies have been going down over the last couple of years. But if you -- the other thing to look at is the number of licensed sales producers. So which is really more important is how many people do we have out there selling. Matt might want to make a comment about -- I think what I would say is if you're really getting at where the agents heads, Matt might want to make a comment about agency productivity.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. So let me try to answer it this way. The underlying premise to your question is that historically, over the last year or 2, we saw a decline in some of the agent population, and is that continuing or is that slowing. And I would say, first, not all of that was unintended. We had some expected attrition during that period, as we were shifting and trying to get to a more productive agency force. I would say, much like the comments I made about homeowners and other efforts, the vast majority of that is behind us. We've seen agencies prove that they can be very effective with our new structure, with our new compensation structure, with our new support model and with our new customer value proposition. So we are seeing a stabilization of agency numbers. And as Tom mentioned, we have a large initiative underway to not only grow the number of agencies, but to grow the number of licensed sales professionals, which is working quite well right now. We are seeing net positive growth in many states, and we have a series of things we are rolling out to improve the recruiting selection and training and development of those licensed sales professionals and provide additional support to them and enable them to be as successful as we have been focused on for our agency owners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, on the reinsurance purchases, have you considered buying more reinsurance to reduce the volatility on the homeowners side since pricing is low right now?","Thomas J. Wilson","Vinay, thanks for your question. I'll point out it's not really a follow-up. And I would ask all the next people -- I do want to try and get to everybody. We're always looking at reinsurance and the right way to shed risk or to keep risk and what's economic, and we're comfortable where we're at.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So on Esurance, obviously, a big uptick in growth in the quarter, sequentially helpful. Wondering what you've learned over the past year and if there's any couple of specific things that you're doing now that's leading to the acceleration of growth. And then it's not a follow-up but really related, just -- is there a target, a GAAP combined ratio target that we should be thinking about as your sort of short-term operating goal for Esurance as we look out over the next year or 2?","Don Civgin","Josh, it's Don Civgin. What I would attribute Esurance's success to thus far is the fact that, in a very thoughtful way, they focused on what the customer value proposition they're building is. So when you look at their set of features and services that they provide to their customers, they are really quite cutting-edge. And so first of all, they have a really strong offering for their particular customer segment. Second, I think the affiliation with the Allstate brand, with Esurance and Allstate company, has played very strongly in the market. That was always something that was a barrier for them from a conversion and retention point of view, and the affiliation with the brand, Allstate, has helped them, I think, substantially. And I think the third thing is their advertising campaign, their marketing efforts have been quite successful. And so when I look at kind of the whole results that we're seeing, not only we're seeing growth, we're seeing -- as a result of the advertising, we're seeing better conversion. As you can tell from the reports, we're seeing better retention, and they're getting a better mix of customer, and so -- with prior insurance and so forth. So we're feeling good that there are good, solid reasons for why they're performing the way they are. The only thing I'd add on that is, and this is important, Esurance is getting its growth not from Allstate customers. So we monitor it very closely, and Esurance is taking market share from competitors. There's no transfer between our brands. They're just, quite honestly, winning in that customer segment, and we feel good about it. As it relates to the target combined ratio, we would target an economic combined ratio and then decide how flexible we can be on the GAAP combined ratio, because as I said before, we're running this on an economic basis. So I would tell you we don't necessarily have a target GAAP ratio. So long as the business we're building is good, solid profitable business, we're happy with it.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was looking at the repurchase, and maybe I don't understand a few things. It looks like on the accelerated share repurchase, I guess you're through $444 million of the $0.5 billion. Am I thinking about that correctly? And that means you've paid about $48 in the quarter per share. It seems a little expensive to me given where the stock traded this quarter. Maybe I don't understand how this works, so you can explain it a little bit.","Steven E. Shebik","So Josh, we bought back in the open market, for the first couple of months of the quarter, a couple hundred million dollars of shares, and then we pre-funded $500 million in this accelerated program and received 9.2 million shares back. We will settle that at the end of that program and pay either in more shares or they will hopefully pay us some additional shares, but we will pay them a few shares to settle out the deal. If you look at both the earnings release and the 10-Q, we have that broken out for you. I'm not sure about the $444 million. I have to check.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just saying that you guys said you were through $1.33 billion, and $226 million plus $1.33 billion leaves me at $1.5 billion.","Steven E. Shebik","Got it. So what that is -- you don't get all the shares back for the $500 million, so that reflects effectively the amount of shares they gave us, which was based on $425 million at the price on -- I think it was March 1. So it was not $48.","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, I would just point out it's going to be cheap relative to what the stock's going to be.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I hope so. That would be my goal. The other thing I was wondering, just in terms of the pace, do you expect to be done with the program before hurricane season? Do you expect to be buying during hurricane season? How does that affect your purchasing habits?","Steven E. Shebik","You mean the accelerated program?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The accelerated -- and both programs together. Where do you expect to be come July 1, I guess, compared to September 30?","Steven E. Shebik","So the accelerated program goes as late as July 2, so we don't have control over that. And after that, we will go back to open-market purchases. So generally, if you look in the past 2 or 3 years, we slow down during hurricane season. So probably mid-July through the end of September, kind of pending when the storms are, we buy less. And we buy more in the first half of the year and in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Could you add some details on how the Drive Wise program is rolling out and what you expect for the next 12 months from that program?","Thomas J. Wilson","Adam, this is Tom. I'll make a general comment about Drive Wise, and Matt can talk about the rollout. So there is a difference between Drive -- first, of course, all -- there is an odd word, telematics, which is the analytics connected to the car. There is a difference between our program and some of the other ones out there, in that ours is called Drive Wise because it is a continuous connection with the customers as opposed to a moment in time or one that stops at some point once you get down with the pricing. Matt can talk about what we're doing to leverage and build that strategy out both near term and longer term.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Adam, so let me just kind of give you a snap -- an assessment of where we are right now. So it's been rolled out in 16 states so far, including 6 in April. And we'll continue to roll that out through the year. We'll probably have 3 or 4 states per quarter. We've seen very favorable early results from a new business lift perspective. So as we roll it out, the new customers are excited about it and interested in it. To date, we have just over 400 million miles that have been driven by customers using the device. And of those receiving a driving discount, the average savings is actually just about 14%. So it is both promoting safer driving behavior and resulting in a benefit to the customers. We've seen a really interesting dynamic on the enrollment. More than 1\/3 of all new customers enroll with Drive Wise when it's available, which is a greater take rate than we anticipated as we do this. Now we're looking at -- as we continue to roll this out, we continue to look at next-generation versions of Drive Wise and ways of making it even more affordable for us, easier to place into the car, with less required interaction on the part of either customers or agents and additional functionality that not only continues to provide us with information about driving habits that we can use to perfect our ratings models and to provide better pricing to certain customers, but also that provide additional tangible benefits to customers based upon the new connection now that would be available with our data sources and them in their cars.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. Do you think that's helping the new issued applications, which really bumped up in the quarter?","Matthew E. Winter","There's no doubt that it is -- it has some impact, but I would say this is a system, Adam, and it's hard to attribute upticks to any one component. There's lots of things happening all at once, including decline in taking rate, including tremendously improved agent productivity and agent engagement. There's marketing effectiveness with new types of ads. There's new generations of agency management systems that are helping the agencies be more productive. So I think there's lots of things contributing to that new business lift, but we do know that Drive Wise is providing some lift as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Matt, I've asked this in the past on some calls and then just ask it again here. This favorable loss trend you see in the homeowners side, how much do you think of that is your own underwriting initiatives? And if that's the case, how much of that -- how long are we going to see that benefit in loss trend from what you've been doing with deductibles in roofs and stuff?","Matthew E. Winter","Did we answer your question last time you asked, Brian?","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, a couple -- 2 quarters ago, you did. I'm not going to tell you what you said, though.","Matthew E. Winter","I believe I remember what I said every time, which was that I'm not going to give you exact percentages, but about half is due to sustainable changes in our model and in our underwriting standards. And we were benefiting from some favorable weather that contributed about the other half. Look, this is a constantly evolving product line. As more and more house and home gets in the market and as a greater percentage of our homeowners' book is comprised of house and home product, it will impact our sensitivity to certain weather patterns and to certain events. And as the weather changes and as we continue to get more and more sophisticated in our risk management, in our concentration limits and the way we use our full portfolio, that's going to change it as well. You may recall, Brian, that I mentioned that we look at the homeowners issue as a portfolio. So we not only have the historical Allstate product, we have the new house and home product, we have our excess and surplus carrier, North Light, and we have a multitude of nonproprietary homeowners offerings provided through Ivantage, our brokerage capability. And so as we continue to refine those and stay on top of the trends, we think we will continue to make progress. But weather is weather, and it's volatile, and we saw that this last quarter. We saw water claims pop up. And it was -- we saw a freeze in Arizona in the middle of January that created a 300% increase in pipe burst claims in the month. That kind of stuff happens, and so we just -- we'll stay on top of it, and we continue to perfect the product and the underwriting and the risk management as a system.","Operator","And our final question today is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","I'll just ask, actually, one question. What is -- in your opinion, what is the normal seasonality for the underlying combined ratio, and has that changed as your mix changes a little bit over time?","Thomas J. Wilson","Paul, I don't think you can actually -- in terms of first quarter relative to -- are you trying to -- first quarter relative to our 88 to 90, is that what you're headed for?","Paul Newsome","Yes, I mean, I just want to know if -- I mean, in the past, companies have talked about sort of like non-cat weather-type impacts that affect things from quarter to quarter, and I'm just curious -- you've obviously changed your exposures quite a bit over time -- if that's changed.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, it's a good question, one that is very difficult and really impossible to answer because seasonality, of course, all depends on whether the -- when you start splitting into what season is it. Maybe April is spring, maybe April is still winter, as we saw yesterday. And then, of course, it depends when the weather happens, not just on the date but the type of -- time of day. So a hailstorm during heavy traffic costs you a lot more than a hailstorm at night because the cars are in garages. We've tried to and continue to try to answer your question so that we can look in granularity at the level of profitability in our various states, and it's really impossible. So far, we've not been able to correct the code despite lots of computer and intellectual horsepower.","Okay. Thank you all. Overall, it was a good start to 2013. We remain focused on executing our strategy, which is unique product and services to distinct customer segments. And then we have our 5 priorities, which we'll continue to report back to you on. Thank you for a little extra time today, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik and me, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; John Dugenske, our new Chief Investment Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; and Eric Ferren our Corporate Controller.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And, as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you as always for taking your time and investing with us and to understand the progress we\u2019re making at Allstate. So let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. Allstate delivered strong financial results in the second quarter. Net income was $550 million or $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and that is in comparison to $242 million last year really reflects improved auto insurance margins and strong investment results from our performance base strategy.","Operating income per share was $1.38 in the quarter. The improvement in auto insurance profitability is a result of us rapidly reacting to higher loss costs beginning in 2015 and it was aided by declining frequency in the first half of 2017. Investment income on our $81 billion portfolio also increased in prior year, as stable earnings from the quarter, market base fixed income portfolio was supplemented with higher results from the performance base portfolio. Operating income return on equity was 30.5% as you can see at the bottom of the table, a significant improvement over last year.","Go to Slide 3 which shows our operating priorities for 2017. We made excellent progress on the five operating priorities, but not all of this is yet impacted reported financial results. The first goal is to better serve customer and we measure customer satisfaction by a net promoter score and an increase for most of our businesses although this is not let yet led to higher policy retention. We do expect higher customer satisfaction to translate into higher growth particularly as insurance auto price increase is moderate. Allstate manages shareholder capital to deliver attractive returns which acquire us to achieve target economic returns on capital. As you can see from our results, we are excelling in this priority.","Auto insurance margins have improved, reflecting the broad-based profit improvement plans initiated over two years ago. Profitability also benefited from lower frequency of accidents reflecting both our profit improvement plan and overall flattening in market. The reported auto insurance combined ratio for all brands was 96.6 for the quarter and 95.8 for the Allstate brand. Auto insurance combined ratio for the first six months of the year was 94.1 or 6.5 below the prior year. The primary driver of difference was an increase and that led to over $700 million in underwriting profit difference between these first two quarters in the first two quarters of last year.","The homeowners insurance plan was also profitable in the quarter led by Allstate brand which had a combined ratio of 97.2 despite $650 million of catastrophe losses. The property liability recorded combined ratio was 97.2 and the underlying combined ratio was 85.5 in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, our underlying combined ratio was 85.1, assuming current loss trends continue, we expect to end 2017 at or below the low end of our annual outlook range of 87-89.","Allstate Financial operating income increased to $153 million is a strategy to increase performance base investments to the annuity business generated good results. Long-term value creation also requires growth in the customer base. The acquisition of SquareTrade in January was added over 31 million policies and Steve will cover our key priorities with SquareTrade in a few minutes. Allstate Benefits continues with 17 year track record of growth and policies in force exceed 4 million. The Allstate brand is now accelerating the trusted advisor initiative to raise growth by delivering a better value proposition as a local advice and branded product customer segment. ","A large component of operating income is results from investment income so despite the continuation of historically low interest rates, we\u2019ve done quite well there as well. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a high quality fixed income portfolio which generates predictable earnings with modest growth. The value of the market base portfolio is increased this quarter due to reduction in corporate bond yields and higher equity values. The performance base portfolio had a great quarter with strong growth in private equity and real estate earnings.","We focus on delivering current results while investing for long-term growth. In addition to the trusted advice initiative, we have growth plans for Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade, Allstate Roadside and Esurance. We're also investing in building connected car platform at Arity, which is continued to enhance its capabilities in telematics, data, analytics and customer service.","Slide 4 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you can see from the back to the top, we delivered excellent returns, increased book value, maintained a conservative financial position while increasing shareholders ownership in the Company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. We've returned $903 million to shareholders for the first six months to the year that includes repurchasing 7.9 million shares of our common stock or 2.1% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year.","Yesterday, we authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will begin following the completion of our current 1.5 billion program. Our intention is to fund its new program through a combination of deployable capital, operating cash flow and a potential issuance of preferred shares.","Now, let me turn it back to John.","John Griek","Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows property liability results by customers segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $8.3 billion which was a 3% increase from the prior year and the recorded combined ratio of 97.2 was 3.6 points better than the prior year quarter. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the second quarter was 85.5, 3.1 points better than the prior year quarter.","The underlying combined ratio for the second quarter includes 0.6 points or $52 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to the expansion of QuickFoto Claim, our virtual estimating platform. This expansion resulted in improved efficiencies and the closure of a number of claims drive in offices. As you know, our strategy is to provide different customer value prepositions for the four consumer segments of the property liability market.","The Allstate brand in the lower left competes with the local advice and branded segments. We're the most prominent competitors of State Farm, Nationwide and Farmers. Obviously, GEICO and Progressive target these customers as well, but do not offer the same value preposition provided by our 10,400 Allstate agencies. This segment comprises 90% of our total premiums written.","The underlying combined ratio was 84.4 with the favorable prior year comparison being driven by improving loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 92.8 underlying combined ratio, 5 points below the prior year. Net written premium was 2.3% higher in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter due to a 3.3% increase in auto. Esurance in the lower right serves the customers who prefer branded product, but are comfortable handling their insurance needs.","GEICO and Progressive Direct have a larger share of this segment than their overall market share. We continue to focus on improving the auto loss ratio, raising customer satisfaction and rapidly growing homeowners policies in force. The combination of these initiatives will support long-term growth.","The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improves slightly and was below 100 for the second consecutive quarter. The homeowners business continues to grow rapidly with underlying profitability that reflects start-up cost. The underlying combined ratio of 125 in the second quarter of 2017 was significantly better than the prior year quarter as homeowners marketing spend was reduced. ","Encompass, in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. We are making good progress in improving underlying margins, but the business has gotten smaller as we exit on profitable markets and raise prices. As we achieve rate adequacy, we will initiate growth plan on a targeted basis in this segment.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 6 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance in more detail. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the second quarter was 95.8 which was 5.4 point below the prior year quarter and benefited from increased average return premium, lower frequency and favorable prior year reserve re-estimates primarily related to entry coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8 in the second quarter of 2017 improved by 5 point compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a 5.7 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio.","The chart on the top right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiate in 2015. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line increased 5.6% to $999 compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expense shown by the red line was nearly flat. This resulted in a favorable GAAP of $72 per policy compared to the mid-teens in the second quarter of 2015. While we continue to selectively file rate increases to keep pace with loss trends, the overall magnitude of rates taking will moderate, if the gap between the red and blue line is maintained. ","Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverage are shown on the bottom chart. Frequency continued to show improvement across both coverages in the second quarter of 2017 and favorable trends were geographically widespread. The lower frequency in 2017 reflects good weather in the first quarter, the benefits of the auto insurance profit improvement plan and moderating frequency trends across the industry.","Slide 7 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate branded auto insurance. As you can see from the graph at the top, overall policy counts have flattened down on a sequential quarter basis. This reflects an increase in new issued application and a steady renewal ratio. We are beginning to accelerate the components of the trusted advisor initiative while expanding Allstate branded distribution with the objective of policies in force. This should be supported by fewer required price increases now that auto margins have improved.","Slide 8 shows similar information for Allstate branded homeowners which has had consistent profitability and is also being positioned for growth.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Shebik","Thanks, John. Let\u2019s go to Slide 9 and our investment results. Overall, investment results have been strong this year, reflecting favorable market condition and the asset allocation decision to increase performance base investments, which reflect the 10 year history of increasing commitments and building our capabilities. Today, we utilize third-party managers, co-investments through additional partnerships and our own direct investing and have created a broad portfolio of diversified investments. Total return in the upper left graph was 1.8% for the quarter, as our strategic positioning coupled with favorable market conditions, show strong results across our diversified portfolio.","Investment income shown in the blue has consistently contributed approximately 1% of return per quarter with stable earnings from our market base portfolio of primarily investment grade fixed income investments. Total return varies based on the portfolio value at the end of each quarter as reflected by the valuation component shown in grey. As you can see the value of the portfolio increased in second quarter primarily due to lower corporate bond yields and higher equity prices.","The Property-Liability bond portfolio which totaled $32 billion is concentrated in three to five year maturities. If interest rates rise, bond valuations will be negatively impacted however net investment income will increase over time. Net investment income in total and for the market based and performance based portfolios is shown in the upper right graph. Net investment income for the second quarter was $897 million, $135 million higher than second quarter of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by performance based investment income of $263 million. While performance based income is variable from quarter-to-quarter. Long term returns for Allstate have been attractive as shown by the bottom two graphs.","The quarterly impact of performance based net income has averaged $155 million over the last 10 quarters and is largely driven by private equity and real estate investment. The table beneath the chart on the bottom left shows the increase in maturing value of performance based portfolio overtime. Our performance based portfolio has generated attractive long-term economic returns as shown in the bottom right. Internal rates of return are generally over 10%. The recent downturn in the 10 year measure reflects high valuations just prior to the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.","Turning to Slide 10, Allstate Financial had a substantial increase in profitability as a result of the performance based investment results. Premiums and contract charges totaled $591 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to prior year quarter. Operating income of $153 million increased by 27.5% over the prior year quarter. Life insurance net income of $60 million and operating income of $63 million were both $1 million below prior year, as higher contract benefits and expenses were partially offset by higher premium and net investment income.","Allstate Benefits net and operating income were both $25 million in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income $4 million below the prior year quarter, as higher revenue was more than offset by increased contract benefits and investments in growth. Premiums and contract charges increased 7.2% compared the prior year quarter, primarily related to growth in hospital indemnity, critical illness, short-term disability and accident products.","Annuities operating income of $65 million in the quarter was an increase of $38 million compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued benefit from our performance based investment strategy. You remember we increased the amount of performance based assets in this business to match the long duration of liabilities. This should generate increased shareholder value, but does require us to utilize more capital in the business and lower interest income both of which suppress short-term returns on capital.","Slide 11 provides detail on SquareTrade. Last quarter, we indicated additional disclosures which we provided regarding this recently acquired business. SquareTrade has three primary objectives. First, to increase and broaden Allstate's customer relationships, this will be accomplished through the existing model of selling through store based and online retailers, leveraging AllState's other market facing businesses and entering new markets either from a product or geographic perspective.","Second, SquareTrade is growing rapidly by utilizing innovative customer service approaches to reinvent a traditional product offering and it'll continue to utilize this capability to enhance this competitive position. Third, as all of our businesses seek to do, SquareTrade will earn attractive returns on capital. We evaluate this by looking at long-term cash flows. For high growth businesses such as SquareTrade, we use shorter term measures such operating profit to ensure we are on pace to meet our long-term objectives, but are willing to continue investing in growth even if it reduces near-term profitability.","Moving to second quarter results as shown on the bottom hand of the page. SquareTrade has solid growth primarily through the U.S. retail channel with policies in force increasing by 1.4 million from the first quarter to a total of 31.3 million, as shown in the graph in the bottom left. Over those last 12 months policies in force have grown by 28%. Premiums written in the second quarter of $85 million in both of the magnitude of product sales, while earned premium of $70 million reflects a recognition of that premium over the approximate three year average duration of coverage.","Underwriting loss total $22 million in the second quarter, reflecting $23 million of amortization of purchases intangible assets related to the acquisition. Operating income which excludes the amortization of purchase intangible assets was positive in the second quarter, totaling $1 million. We also included a new non-GAAP measure this quarter adjusted operating income to provide a run rate view of the business. This factor excludes purchase accounting adjustments made to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities as their fair value.","During the second quarter, we executed a 100% quarter share reinsurance agreement with our largest third-party insurer. As results, reduced the premium paid to that third-party insurer which will increase underwriting income. Additionally, Allstate assumed approximately $200 million in funds, held in trust for potential future claim payments. Invested income on these funds will be earned by SquareTrade, in conjunction with this agreement, claims and claims expense benefitted by a $6 million pretax favorable adjustment for loss experience.","Slide 12 provides an overview of a new reporting structure will expand our financial reporting segments from four to seven. We plan to adapt the new reporting structure in the fourth quarter. This instruction will provide enhanced transparency and operating valuation of our businesses grouped by like attributes. Allstate Protection will continue to include the traditional property liability businesses that address the four segments of the consumer property liability market Allstate, Esurance, Encompass and Answer Financial.","A service business segment will include operations that have a larger portion of earnings from services for generally have less underwriting risks. This is likely to include SquareTrade, Arity, Allstate Roadside, Allstate Dealer Services. Allstate Financial will be split in three segments. As you know, we'll substantially reduce the breadth and size of Allstate Financial over the last decade. Allstate Life sells life insurance to Allstate agencies and support of the trusted advisor strategy to broaden customer relationships. This business earns a low double-digit return.","Allstate Benefits with a high growth in mid-to-high-teens return business. So breaking these results out will highlight its value creation. Allstate Financials does not sell proprietary annuity given our view on economic returns. So the annuity is really a closed block of business. Returns are low in part reflecting current lower interest rates, in addition as we discussed decision to maximize shareholder value by increasing allocation to perform its based investments that had an additional negative impact on near-term return on capital. This new segmentation will have an impact on goodwill impairment testing and the irrigation of the Allstate Financial reserves with efficiency testing. More information is available in the Form-10Q, and we will provide additional detail later this year. ","Now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.","Greg Peters","I just wanted to circle back -- I have asked this of you before, but now that you have had two quarters in a row where your underlying combined ratio is certainly trending better than expected, I'm curious about your view of competitive positioning in the marketplace, especially when I think we've seen some anecdotal stories or situations where some of your peers have started to cut some pricing.","Tom Wilson","Greg, this is Tom. I\u2019ll start and then Matt can jump in. First, we do think we were out early and taking the price increases that were necessary in auto insurance and that has put us in a position to not have -- assuming these trends continue. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to raise prices as much which obviously helps because price is a large component that which we compete on. It\u2019s not the only thing we can compete on, however, so there is a wide variety of ways in which we compete with other people.","The other part is it largely depends what other companies do, so it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s hard for -- it's impossible for us to predict what they'll do. So some of the large mutuals which have significant underwriting losses may choose to stay there and then it will have really won\u2019t be any competitive window for us to grab more shares from those specific competitors. Some of our other competitors choose to subsidize various state run losses there by having lower prices -- higher margins in other states.","So, I would say, we prefer to be on this end of the equation having improved our profitability. So we\u2019re in a balance position to grow, but I don\u2019t think you can automatically assume that because other people didn\u2019t follow us, that they will follow us or that this is sort of open to buy and it's easy to take business. Matt, you may have some more specific comments.","Matt Winter","Sure. Thanks, Greg, and it\u2019s Matt. First, it all varies based up geographies, so we\u2019ll start there. On the countrywide basis as I said last quarter, we feel good that we have essentially caught up the loss trends and are now within a more reactive mode where we\u2019re monitoring loss trends and keeping pace with them. But that of course has some variability state-by-state, there are some states where we still have indications and we still need to take some rate. And there are others where we\u2019re doing quite well and things have stabilized. ","Overall, we feel really good about our competitive position. In our business with our distribution model, one of the most important things for them is stability and so as we\u2019re stable, as we maintained more normalized adjustments to rate and more inflationary rate adjustments, as we\u2019re able to build multi-month and multi-year marketing plans and give them predictability, they are more willing to invest, they\u2019re able to do long-term business plans. And we see increased quota activity and increased closing rates, and as a result increased new business production.","So, we actually feel quite good about our competitive position, it's interesting that you point to rate deductions that you've seen. We still see lots of our competitors with very large indications that are not yet taken all of their indications in some states, and others they're still taking double-digit rates. So, we're seeing it all over the board while we are for the most part very stable in taking modest rate increases, which we believe is very good for our business model.","Greg Peters","As a follow-up, with frequency, both BI and property, being favorable for you in the last two quarters I believe. Is there anything going on in the environment that might lead us to believe that that's going to continue?","Matt Winter","Boy, if I could predict the future, Greg, I'd be a very man and Tom will be happier too. What we've seen is a moderation in frequency the first half of this year, as we closed out last year, it was really unclear what frequency would look like, we were as you know monitoring miles driven, monitoring the unemployment rate, monitoring cash prices, and monitoring all those things that fed into miles driven, which fed into in addition to distracted driving fed in tax within frequency.","And we've seen some moderation there which has been good for our business, these first two quarter. And we have no way really projecting what is going to look like for the remainder of the year. We feel as I said, good about the fact that it appears not to be making step function changes that is, it appears to be moving in a more normalized basis up and down, normal variability with weather and things like that, which is much easier for us to react to and monitor and take appropriate rates for.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan. Your question please.","Sarah DeWitt","As you begin to transition to growth, should we expect the underlying combined ratio to stay around these levels or should we start to see it rise a bit given maybe a new business penalty or less price action?","Tom Wilson","When we manage overall profitability, we obviously look at the underlying combined ratio and it's lower than we expected this year, obviously. We also looked at the reported combined ratio and factor in cats and everything else. And we kind of like where we're at. Could it drift up? Sure, frequency and severity typically bounce around by more than a 1% a year. So, it's a move around, but you said, do we have an objective to further reduce it from here? The answer would be no. Might it go lower? It all depends what happens in the market, but we don't -- we really try to prioritize and balance between maintaining that combined ratio and growth. Obviously, when 2015, frequency and severity went up faster than we had factored into our pricing, we had to prioritize profitability over growth. I would say we're back to a more normal position today. Matt, anything you want to add?","Matt Winter","Yes, let me just add. This is Matt. Let me add just two items for you. You mentioned the new business penalty and whether or not, as we begin growing whether or not that could influence the combined ratio. Certainly, the new business penalty is fact of life that as you grow fast, the newer businesses not yet tenured, they tend to have a higher loss ratio than the more tenured business. One of these things, however, that mitigates against that is that in our reaction to the frequency spreads in the last two years, we took very segmented rate actions, and we took segmented rate actions against those worst performing segments of the book.","As a result, the quality of our book increased that led to more defections from the worst performing segments. It also led to us adding few or new customers from those lower performing segments. So, we believe that the new business penalty will be dampened as we add on assuming that we maintain the same high quality, we\u2019ve been seeing lately. So I don\u2019t expect that to be a significant drag. The other things I would point out is that there has been some commentary about whether or not this will cause us to dramatically increase marketing spend to stimulate growth, and really the marketing spend is not the primary driver on the growth right now, as we've discussed many-many times.","Retention was actually a bigger influence for us than the new business on our total items in force. And so, we are just as focused on, I am trying to improve our retention within those balance of what we can control, since a lot of it is uncontrollable since it's based upon competitor actions. But for those things that we can influence, such as customer satisfaction and customer engagements and stability of pricing, we're just as focused on the retention component as we are on new business.","Sarah DeWitt","And then secondly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your QuickFoto Claim and other claims initiatives and how we should think about the potential for savings there, as well as if there should be further restructuring cost? I think your LAE ratio is running around 11 points, but would it be fair to say maybe over time you could shave a couple points off of that?","Matt Winter","Sure, it's Matt again. So let me just start high first. So, we've talked about integrated digital enterprise and emerging technologies, one of those areas that we are deploying it initially and in quite some force is the claims area. We believe it's an area of primed for it because there it is some inefficiency in the way the model operated. In the past, there was a lot of windshield time, there was a lot of dead time, unproductive time as adjusters drove around, driving to cars, driving to body shops for both initial estimates and supplements, and we looked at that and realized that emerging technologies, data and analytics could rectify that and take some of the inefficiency out of the system.","So we began the digitalization of the claims process. Last year, we launched a new immediate payment method which we called Quick Card Pay. Quick Card Pay is the fastest claim payment method in the P&C industry. We make payments directly to the debit cards within seconds. We\u2019ve also been assessing roof damage with from hell event utilizing drowns, and we\u2019ve been doing that quite successfully for the last several quarters. In the last quarter, we open two digital operating centers. They handle auto claims on the countrywide basis by estimating through photos.","Approximately half right now of all drivable vehicles are currently being inspected through our Quick Photo method of settlement. That has led to the shutdown of many of our driving claim centers and it has also led to reduce need for fuel adjuster adjusters since we took a lot of that inefficiency out of the system. We now have our adjusters looking at enhance photos, digital photos in the computers without having to drive tooling from the sites.","We\u2019ve also began utilizing video chat technology to review supplemental damage with auto body shops, it\u2019s something we call virtual assist and the combination of all those things has led to a dramatically more productive and more efficient claim system. We've taken a cycle that use to take five to seven days in order to get eyes on a vehicle and get an estimate at and we\u2019ve done that now in hours and we are literally doing that in under claim for hour.","So, for supplementary instead of having for schedule when adjusted from back out to body shop and look at supplemental damage, we now use to video chat technology same day and we move it along everybody sat either customer get the car back center, the body shop gets the car up their much sooner and they take another car in. And we are reducing rental car time and improving customer satisfaction. So we do believe that the combination to be leads to more efficient system, it leads to obvious cost savings as we take inefficiency out of the system and it leads to greater customer satisfaction. ","Tom Wilson","Sarah, this is Tom. So I think you might have to go back and look at the ULAE, your number seemed higher to me. I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re slicing out, but you can get that from John. Let me pick up on Matt's Virtual Assist, so this is -- that\u2019s really a great technology and we\u2019re making available to other insurance company. Basically, as Matt mentioned, it's face time that combined with your claim system. And so, if what enables you to do, it not yet somebody drive out the body shop to do the supplement and that you can do it remotely.","So, we\u2019re -- this is -- it\u2019s available to Arity, so if insurance companies want to use it, this is where we can use our market leading movement here because we think we\u2019re ahead of other people and doing this because you don\u2019t have to go out and train a bunch of body shops how to use this technology. We\u2019ve already trained body shops on it and deployed. So, we\u2019re making that available to other insurance companies. So that's my commercial for Arity.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. And can you quantify the savings you've seen from these initiatives at all?","Tom Wilson","Here is what I would say is, we\u2019re not going to qualify the exact savings. It\u2019s obviously when we take the charge of $52 million, it\u2019s not all that was related to that claim fees. Some was related to restructuring in the legal department. But, we obviously expect the earn net back in a relatively short period of time. And so, that's not five years, it's not five days either. But, so it's pretty substantial savings on an absolute dollar basis. When you look at percentage basis, it's obviously much smaller. Okay, we break all that number -- we break out the restructuring fees by component in the Q.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question please.","Jay Gelb","The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio in auto clearly improved year over year, although it was higher quarter over quarter. I'm just wondering if there is some seasonality that would explain that or if there is some other cause?","Tom Wilson","That would make anything of it, Jay. It bounces around. You'll remember the first quarter January and February were much lower, so really better look at it versus the prior year quarter because of weather patterns.","Jay Gelb","All right. I thought there was some seasonality there. Okay. And then on a bigger picture -- has Allstate given thought to purchasing increased catastrophe reinsurance protection on the working layer catastrophes? It seems that over the past or the Company is on track over the past two years to have around 8 points of catastrophe losses. So, as reinsurance rates keep dropping I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity there for increased risk transfer.","Tom Wilson","I'll make some general comments and then Steve may well jump in. So, first we look at reinsurance broadly continuously and have helped actually develop markets whether that'd be cat bonds or larger longer-term aggregates where we grew out three plus years which were never available before. So we are always active in the market and that's because we're obviously one of the biggest buyers in the market, so people respond to our request. But it comes in couple of different ways, I think what you're suggesting is have we looked at using reinsurance to moderate the annual impact of what I'll call non-large models events, so hail, windstorm and stuff, and so having a lower level of protection.","We feel we can handle that in the volatility, that volatility in our P&L. We look over the at the homeowners business each of the rolling last 12 months, we've made over $1 billion a year, and it gets expensive when you look at. When you go the higher end levels, there is sort of a one in a 100 year event, it has obviously the benefit of not having to have that volatility event back that that event happens, but it also is a capital relief tool. So, we don't mind paying a little higher price for that because we think we can earn a higher return on our equity then the reinsurers need to because of their portfolio diversification and our specific needs, we use it for that purpose. But I would say we're always looking at different ways to do it, we're always trying to moderate the amount of capital we have to put out and maximize the return we get on that capital. Steve, do you want to add?","Steve Shebik","I think you did a pretty good Tom. The only couple of things that might add, we do look not only buying more but how we structure the reinsurance and so we look at annually, it's kind of an annual buy for Allstate in the early part of the year and for Florida, it's going to be mid-part of the year. So if you look particularly this year, we did buy a 200 million cover in the Southeast Florida, in Southeast for auto, which kind of filled in up whole we thought we had, in terms of bringing down retention dollar fit for that area.","So we continue to look not only how it was structured, but there is whole we think might be if a storm were to hit, we focus on that. And as Tom said, it's really economics. And generally what we've seen over the last ample of years, it's hasn\u2019t effect economic for us at that time to buy more or destructed differently. But we are entering into what we consider our normal type period and probably when we look at so we look at again given you our correct. The insurance rate has continued to move down. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. ","Elyse Greenspan","As you guys talk about looking to grow in auto and some of your comments you also did mention in home. Can you just remind us about the bundling within your book, those that purchase both auto and home coverages? And how you expect as you look to improve the retention in auto, how you expect that the play out in home?","Tom Wilson","Matt will answer for the Allstate brand and then Don will make a comment on Esurance because I think there is one of the analyst write-ups last night there was a comment about the Esurance that makes sense.","Matt Winter","Sure, Elyse. It's Matt. So let me talk about the Allstate brands. The last couple of years have bundling capabilities and we have bundled primarily with auto and another product auto and home, auto and life, auto and consumer household products and with all the disruption in the auto business, it has influenced and impacted the potential growth of the other business first. We know that we watch the home area specifically and we know that home is lagging auto because not only because of the 12 month policy and home but the different renewal periods. And as a result, you tend to see a lag in the growth.","So when -- when auto kick-up, it tends to be a quarter or two before home takes-up. And so we're still seeing some of the influence from that disruption in home even though auto has began to stabilize internally other way. Our expectation is fully that as this works its way through the system and I remind you that a lot of growth was taken just to over 12 months ago it has now worked its way through the system as this stabilized and as we hope retention stabilize it's in potentially improved we expect to see our capacity for bundling to improve.","We like that obviously number one we want to serve customers holistically we think it's a 100% consistent with our trusted advisors strategy, but it also helps to leverage the single acquisition cost across multiple product lines, leading to a more efficient system and a more efficient use of marketing fronts. So, as you should expect to see continued emphasis on the part of the Allstate brand to increase the bundling, increase the number of product sold for household, and increasingly meet the needs of our customers. Don, you want to talk about our future?","Don Civgin","First, much of what Matt said about the Allstate brands, Allstate body to the Esurance brand and actually the other brands as well as you see across the industry people, different companies have maybe made the bundle for their customers. That recall them, we acquired Esurance six years ago as a monoline company, so they sold all the auto insurance. If the time we knew that there was an opportunity for us to homeowners to get a different kind of relationship with the customers and that given the different type of customers.","Now, we have -- and by the way we obviously not having the homeowners as a corporation. And so, we were able to leverage the skill we have at Allstate as we build out the Esurance capabilities. The Esurance now has homeowners in 31 states, bundling is a very important to us for the same reasons Matt talked for Allstate. Our attach rates are going up dramatically, as we roll the product out and make it available to customers. And so, it will offer us an opportunity to increase retention, build the different customer relationship and really build the business.","Now, I want to temper those comments, there is only $20 million net return premium here in the second quarter. We have 69,000 policies. It's still relatively small percentage of the book. And there is still volatility in that number, so few large losses will swing back loss ratio up by dramatically, as it did in the second quarter. But, we\u2019ve done for strategic reasons, it\u2019s delivering everything we expect and I think it\u2019s a big opportunity for us to continue to growing Esurance.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then in terms of capital return, you mentioned the new 2 billion buyback program and being financed with capital at hand in your earnings. How do you view M&A right now? I mean you just completed the SquareTrade deal, but any kind of high-level thoughts how you think M&A is still part of the equation as you think about capital return here?","Don Civgin","Well, of course thing we do is look at managing the overall capital and we\u2019d like to invest in our existing businesses to the extent that we can, which is organic growth of obviously leverages our real capabilities for higher returns. We do look at acquisitions and as you mentioned we brought SquareTrade to broadening our product portfolio broadening our distribution we have and give us additional products to be able sell through the adjusted advisor issue through Esurance. And so, if you look at them what we do after that so if we don\u2019t have additional use of the money, we should return it to the shareholder and help increase their relative ownership and the Company.","So in the last three years, we bought that 15% of the shares outstanding. So, your value should grow up by 15% just because return of capital to shareholders, over five years of spend, a little over 25%. So, I would expect that same pattern to continue if we see something interesting, we'll buy it and we paid a lot of money for a SquareTrade, but we believe we can grow just as we did Esurance and Allstate Benefits.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Kai Pan","First question to follow up on the digital claim processing technology, I just wonder how do you measure the accuracy using photos to settle the initial loss reserve versus using adjusters in person?","Matt Winter","Hi, it's Matt. That's a good question. Obviously when you initiate a massive change in process such as this, the quality is one of the most critical things so we did a lot of testing along the way. We still have testing that we do both secondary reviews as well as reviews in persons. So we do selectively have people doing onsite reviews, as I said in the summary that 50% of the drivable cars right now, so we have to look at. And the reality is that quality has been exceptional, supplements are slightly higher but rather an insignificant amount. And the overall quality is quite good.","We are continuing to develop our ability to enhance the digital photos and get better visibility into the damage, obviously as our adjustors get more familiar with how to use these photos and what angles to request and how to change the lighting on it we're able to pick up more-and-more information; we're using some technology to actually help us learn from that and compare photos from similar autos and similar types of accidents to help us baseline. So overall the quality has been quite good, actually slightly better than we expected and the productivity and efficiency savings have been tremendous.","Tom Wilson","Kai, the reserves, remember these are relatively short tailed. So, within 90 days you know what it costs to fix a car. So it cycles its way through and we think we are good there.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. By the way, how much do you spend on these R&D investments? It's a part of your expense ratio, right?","Tom Wilson","I won't give you a number or percentage. I will just tell you that we always look at these things and expense. We invest heavily in research and development whether that'd be the things we talked about here or Arity for other things, and we believe we can handle with the overall P&L. So we do not resource constrain that. Capabilities and ability to execute might constrains but it is not a money constraint.","Kai Pan","My second question is on your sort of like the change of reporting structure. Is there any change in the underlying operating structure? And how big do you think the service business will become a sort of meaningful percentage of the overall like business of the Company?","Tom Wilson","The operating structure is sort of -- what we did really was try to align its way we allocate capital in a way we think about our businesses and to give you increased transparency. We don't have a specific goal percentage of revenue or profit we want them any of those period businesses. But let me give you an example, if you go to Allstate Financial, it's the way -- even though we showed people many of the underlying numbers. When Mary Jane manages that overall business, she doesn't just -- people would look at the overall ROE and tell it's like 6%, or 7% or 8% in the quarter and that is that -- Allstate benefits has great ROEs, Allstate like has good ROEs and it's dragged down by annuities business, and we felt like we just needed to show people in a different way. And even though some of this information you could parse out and accumulate together by looking at the Q or the K or the investor supplement. This really increases our transparency by bundling it together for you in a way that aligns with the way we think about to manage the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Josh Shanker","Allstate. I'm going to apologize in advance because this is going to get in the weeds a little bit, but between Sarah and Kai's questions I'm still having trouble understanding the expenses in technology versus what's in the expense ratio and what's not. Can we talk a little about why the 52 million maybe shows up in the expense ratio? Typically you guys have like 10 million or so of expenses that are other that show up. How should we think about it going forward? And normally, just to understand, you guys are always investing in the future. Why does this show up in the expense ratio and other stuff in the past has not?","Tom Wilson","So, it's not just -- let me be clear, it's not about technology expenses. This is about the cost to for severance for people who were no longer to be required so that's over 500 people, and we have 937 drive-ins, now a lot of those overtime, we structured and month-to-month leases because we knew we are headed here. But we still have in charge to take I mean shut things down, getting leasehold improvements out. So, it's really -- that's not really related to the investment in it at all. It's really related to the shutting down of other stuff. Why does it show up in underlying combined ratio, is the question Matt and I have harangued Steve with for the last three weeks.","And our restructuring charges have always been in there, so I think you should expect to continue to see I mean there even though they perhaps are not a continuing and we would think in terms of underlying. So I don\u2019t think you should expect us to take a $52 million charge there in quarter. With that said to the extent we need to take the charge or any charge really, as we manage it quite on cash flow and economic returns. And if it rattles through the P&L, it rattles through the P&L.","Josh Shanker","Okay, that's perfect. I am on the same page now. And then the limited partnerships, I mean I'm not going to get a great answer out of it, but they were phenomenal this quarter. Were there any specific gains taken that were unusual or was it just a great quarter for mark-to-markets? How should we think about this going forward?","Tom Wilson","John will give you that perspective.","John Griek","Thanks, Josh, this is John. It was a combination of factors. One, we have been building up the book of business you expect that the return that the book of business we get larger. But two, favorable markets to the influence when you look at our performance base assets that you have a correlation of about 70% to public markets so that was a fact there. And then three, to answer your question specifically, there were a few idiosyncratic properties that performed quite well and credit to the team that sifts through many-many opportunities there were some down to the one that make most sense to this firm and investment. ","Josh Shanker","Well, if you need some more co-investment let me know, I have got -- I will try.","John Griek","If I get good returns, right. Jonathan, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly, our final question then comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thanks for squeezing me in. One numbers question. On your net investment income page on 51 -- I'm going in the weeds, I apologize -- your fixed income yields are actually up year-over-year despite the fact you've shortened maturities. How have you been able to keep the yield on fixed incomes going up in a low interest rate world with shorter maturities?","John Griek","Hi, this is John again. As you would imagine that the combination of events can cause changes in yields, not only where you are placed on the yield curve, but also what investments you buy in the market. So part of that is in response to increased holding in securities like high yield and other higher yielding securities. We also did and it should be noted while it is a small move. In the first quarter of this year, we did extend the duration of portfolio by about a quarter of the year and that impacted yields by about 20 basis points.","Bob Glasspiegel","Got you. And one other quickie. On the preferred that you say you are going to issue to help fund the buyback, what's the motivation there? What roughly yield and magnitude are we talking?","John Griek","So, we\u2019re looking at part of the potential funding to our buyback.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right. ","John Griek","So, I think currently right now the market seems fairly attractive and this kind of goes on cycles. And so we will look at that as part of that financial, obviously, we don\u2019t have to do it because we have plenty of capital and cash. But when opportunities there, we think our track available we want to take advantage of that. ","Bob Glasspiegel","Rough idea of the size and yield that you would be paying? Ballpark?","John Griek","Well, the yield should be as low as possible from our standpoint.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right. ","John Griek","You saw a deal went out earlier this week and a couple of ticks over five. And so when you can issue perpetual equity that as we guarantee a 5% return you can use that as a buyback comment, we think that\u2019s a good trade on behalf of shareholders. And as you know we\u2019ve done a 1 billion a three quarters of it over the last, Steve, two or three years.","Steve Shebik","Four years.","John Griek","Four years and we like the results of that. And so there is more -- you wouldn't obviously do this for a $100 million bucks, it\u2019s not worth all the overall effort. So, we haven\u2019t sized it, but there is plenty of opportunities for us to issue given our brand name, our credit capacity and our affiliated payments.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Well, thank you, Jonathan, and good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik and me, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller; and John Dugenske, our new Chief Investment Officer, who joined the team on March 1.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And, as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate's operating results. Turning to slide 2, we'll get started.","What a strong start in 2017 on both our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. You can see the value of having a broad-based business model that provides a broad set of protection to customers across North America was evident this quarter as we had excellent profitability despite several large hailstorms.","Net income was $666 million while operating income per share was $1.64. Auto insurance profitability improved due to the profit improvement actions that were started in 2015 and mild weather in January and February. Homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit despite significant catastrophe losses.","The Property-Liability combined ratio was 93.6 and the underlying combined ratio was 84.8 in the first quarter, below the full year outlook we provided of 87 to 89. Investment results were solid with higher investment income, which also increased Allstate Financial's operating income.","We also closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, which expanded the protection products we offer, gives us distribution to major retailers, and added 30 million policies in force. We returned $371 million to shareholders. And as you can see at the bottom of the slide, return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.9% for the last 12 months.","If you turn to slide 3, given the continued expansion of our business model, we added two you-are-here charts. So when you're at the mall or in a park and you're trying to get a picture of the entire place, you're looking for those you-are-here maps. Well, slide 3 graphically shows the breadth of our businesses. Allstate's purpose is to protect people from life's uncertainties, and we do this through a wide variety of products and distribution channels.","Starting at the center, our customer-focused strategy has resulted in 73 million proprietary policies issued. We also brokered over $2 billion of premium to Allstate agencies and Answer Financial, and we had third-party service relationships with Allstate Roadside, Allstate Dealer Services, and Arity.","The second ring shows the breadth of our distribution. The outer ring shows the products we provide with the largest group on the left being the Property-Liability products sold now through the Allstate, Encompass and Esurance brands. The right hand of the oval shows a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network.","You turn to slide 4 and we carry this concept further to show the relative impact on the overall company. The upper left pie chart identifies the products that comprise the proprietary policies, including the policies we added with SquareTrade. The middle pie chart shows that most of our revenue is still from the traditional Property-Liability products.","The table on the right breaks out this quarter's operating income by two major segments: Property-Liability and Allstate Financial. We'll now walk through the components of operating income in greater detail starting with the Property-Liability business.","Let's go to slide 5, it shows the Property-Liability results, and starting at the table at the top. Net written premium for the first three months of 2017 was $7.7 billion, which was a 2.8% increase from the prior year. The recorded combined ratio was 93.6, 4.8 points better than the prior-year quarter. When we exclude catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates and, of course, is our underlying combined ratio, for the first quarter, that was 84.8, 2.4 points below the prior year.","The four Personal Property-Liability customer segments are shown on the diagram at the bottom of the page. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left hand, comprises 90% of our premiums written. And that serves customers who prefer branded products and value personal advice and local relationships. The underlying combined ratio was 83.5, with the decrease from the prior year being driven primarily by auto insurance, which had a 90.9 underlying combined ratio, 5 points below the prior year. Given the continued progress made in improving Allstate brand auto margins, we're beginning to invest in expanding distribution and marketing to move back into policy growth mode.","Esurance in the lower right shows customers who prefer a branded product, but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Our focus is on improving financial results and customer satisfaction. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improved and was below 100 in the first quarter. The homeowners business continues to grow rapidly with underlying profitability that reflects start-up costs.","Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about a branded experience and hence are served by independent agencies. We're focused on improving returns and executing our profit improvement plan in this brand. The underlying auto combined ratio of 97.9 improved 5 points compared to the prior-year quarter.","Homeowners underlying profitability still needs to be lower than (07:12) 69.9, given the impact of catastrophes on our quarter results. We'll cover the results of the three underwritten brands in more detail in the subsequent slides.","Now let me turn it over to John.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 6 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto. Starting in the upper left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the first quarter was 90.6, which was 8.4 points below the prior-year quarter and benefited from increased average earned premium, lower frequency, 1.8 points of favorable prior-year reserve re-estimates and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 90.9 in the first quarter 2017 improved by 5 points compared to the first quarter 2016, driven by a 5.4-point improvement in the underlying loss ratio.","The chart on the top right shows the drivers of this improvement; Annualized average premiums increased 6.7% to $989 compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expense increased by 1.1%. This resulted in a favorable gap of $90 per policy.","To provide additional insight into our loss trends by coverage, the bottom half of the page shows the paid severity and frequency trends for both property damage and bodily injury. Property damage paid frequency, shown by the blue bar, decreased 3.2% in the first quarter 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter. Better-than-expected improvement was observed mainly in January and February as the country broadly experienced milder than normal winter weather.","Absolute frequency levels in March were more consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016. Paid frequency trends over the last four quarters have now been flat or declined year-over-year. Property damage paid severity increased by 4.8% in the quarter due to the impact of increased third-party subrogation payments, higher costs to repair new model vehicles, and increased volume of total losses.","On the bottom right, bodily injury paid frequency decreased 20.5% in the first quarter, while paid severity increased by 25.1%. These results are consistent with the trends experienced over the last two quarters.","Frequency and severity should be looked at in combination to get a sense of the true underlying loss trend. And as we've discussed in the past two quarters, the decline in BI paid frequency and corresponding increase in paid severity was driven by process enhancements related to our claim handling discipline around establishment of liability for BI.","These changes involve requiring enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatment, and resulted in a reduction in the mix of smaller dollar claims paid. When we adjust for the impact of this BI process change, the increase in BI severity is more consistent with medical inflationary trends, partially offset by improvements in loss cost management.","We continue to be comfortable with our bodily injury incurred severity trends. You can see by the inset box in the bottom right graph that the combined impact of frequency and severity since the process change last year has essentially been flat.","Slide 7 provides detail on premium and policy growth for Allstate brand auto. Net written premium growth, shown in blue on the top chart, reflects continued average premium increases, stabilizing retention, and improved new business trends, partially offset by a 2.9% decline in policies in force.","We are taking a balanced approach to profitable growth and margin improvement by continuing to execute our auto profit improvement plan in markets with returns below target levels, while implementing growth plans in markets that have achieved rate adequacy. Growth investments include expanding distribution capacity and marketing.","In the first quarter, approved rate increases totaled 1.7% for the Allstate brand, of which 0.6 points was driven by an improved rate in California. We anticipate the overall magnitude of rate increases to moderate going forward as profitability trends improve.","The charts on the bottom of the page show new issued applications and retention for the last three years, along with historical ranges represented by the dashed gray lines. As we implement growth plans, we are beginning to see positive signs of growth with new business applications shown in the bottom left up 4.5% in the first quarter. Auto retention, shown on the bottom right, also has a significant impact on growth and has stabilized over the last few quarters.","Slide 8 highlights Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results. The homeowners recorded combined ratio was 93.7 in the first quarter, which generated $107 million in underwriting income despite elevated catastrophes late in the quarter.","Over the last 12 months, $1.1 billion of underwriting income has been generated by this product line. The underlying combined ratio of 61.3 continues to reflect strong profitability and is within our long-term target range of the low 60s for this line. The bottom half of the page provides detail on our growth trends.","New business and retention levels declined, leading to a 1.4% reduction in policies in force. New business and retention levels in the first quarter are performing near the middle of the historical range shown by the gray lines.","Our work to improve auto margins beginning in 2015 has impacted the homeowners line, since many of the customers in this segment prefer to bundle their purchases. The impact of the auto profit improvement actions on homeowners tends to lag auto by a quarter or two because it's a 12-month policy and generally has a different renewal effective date compared to auto. As auto has experienced an improved trajectory in new business trends, we have begun to see moderation in the rate of decline in homeowners new business.","Slide 9 highlights Esurance results. Esurance is focused on improving financial results and customer satisfaction. So, the recorded combined ratio of 102.4 in the first quarter shown towards the bottom of the upper left hand table was 3.8 points below the prior-year quarter, driven by lower expenses. The expense ratio decreased 5.9 points for the quarter and reflects reduced advertising, improved customer service efficiency, and a smaller impact from the amortization of intangible assets.","Shown in the upper right is the decline in the combined ratio over the last two years. The auto underlying combined ratio, highlighted on the bottom right of the page, was 99.8 in the first quarter, 3.8 points better than the first quarter of 2016. Lower expenses and better frequency and severity trends contributed to the improvement in underlying margins.","Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the bottom left of the page. Net written premium continues to grow on increased average premium, while policies in force were flat to the first quarter 2016. Policy growth in homeowners is offsetting the decline in auto policies. New issued applications declined as a result of lower advertising, while auto retention improved by 0.8 points.","Going to slide 10 highlights results for Encompass. Encompass results for the first quarter were impacted by elevated catastrophes in March and profit improvement actions that continue to be implemented in states with inadequate returns. The recorded combined ratio was 111.7 and included 23.7 points, or $67 million, of catastrophe losses in the first quarter. Encompass results were significantly impacted by the March 26 hail event in Texas. The auto recorded combined ratio of 100.7 was 5 points better than the prior-year quarter.","The underlying combined ratio of 86.6 in the first quarter was better than the first quarter of 2016, as profit improvement actions continue to take hold. The decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns has impacted overall top line trends. And at the same time, we've begun to selectively implement targeted growth plans in states with adequate rate levels.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, John. Slide 11 covers SquareTrade's results. We acquired SquareTrade for $1.4 billion in January. The first accounting to revalue the balance sheet assigning $486 million to amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and technology, and $1.080 billion to goodwill.","On the income side, as a service business, premiums written of $81 million for the quarter reflect the magnitude of product sales, while earned premium of $59 million reflects the recognition of their premium over the approximately 2.5-year average duration of coverage","The underwriting loss of $35 million for the quarter is significantly impacted by expenses related to growing the business as well as $23 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. We anticipate amortizing approximately $90 million in 2017. The intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis with approximately 75% expected to be amortized by 2021.","As highlighted in the exhibit on the upper right, SquareTrade had a small $16 million dilutive impact to our consolidated operating income in the quarter, including the underwriting loss and debt financing costs. This excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles I mentioned above and $13 million of after-tax one-time transaction costs reported in net income but not operating income. We are developing operating statistics and performance metrics for SquareTrade to help you understand quarterly results, which will be included in the second quarter earnings.","Turning to slide 12, Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $593 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income of $110 million, an increase of 5.8% over the prior-year quarter, was driven by improved investment returns, partially offset by higher mortality in the life business. Net income of $108 million was $40 million, or 59%, higher than the prior-year quarter due to lower net realized capital losses. Net operating income trends by business are shown in the chart to the bottom of the page.","Allstate Life net income of $57 million was flat to the prior year, while operating income of $59 million was $7 million below the first quarter of 2016 as higher mortality was partially offset by higher premiums. Allstate Benefits net and operating income were both $22 million in the first quarter of 2017, with operating income consistent with the prior-year quarter.","Premiums and contract charges increased 7.2% compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily related to growth in critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity products. Higher expenses were driven by continued growth and one-time expenses, including guaranty fund assessments. Allstate Annuities recorded operating income of $29 million in the quarter, an increase of $14 million over the first quarter of 2016 due to higher investment spread.","Slide 13 provides details of our investment results. We manage the portfolio's risk profile proactively and holistically, considering relevant market conditions and a corporate risk appetite. The chart at the top left shows how we have migrated the portfolio to a more balanced risk and return profile.","We reduced the interest rate risk to a lower allocation to investment-grade interest-bearing assets as well as targeting a shorter fixed income duration with the belief that markets weren't providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk.","Through our performance-based investing, we're replacing market risk with idiosyncratic risk, emphasizing ownership over lending. These investments now comprise $6.2 billion or 8% of the portfolio, and while they require higher economic and regulatory capital, we expect them to deliver attractive economic returns for our shareholders.","Pre-tax yield by business segment are shown at the upper right. The interest-bearing yield reflects a stability of fixed income portfolio earnings, while the total yield includes the variability of performance-based investments across the quarters.","The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield is close to market yield and respond quickly to increases in interest rates. Allstate Financial has a higher-yielding, longer duration profile, aligned with its liability structure.","Net investment income by strategy is shown in the lower left graph. The portfolio total return is provided in the lower right. Total return for the first quarter was a solid 1.6%, reflecting fixed income price depreciation and credit spread tightening and strong equity market performance. Investment income has delivered a consistent contribution to return of approximately 1% per quarter.","Slide 14 highlights the continued strength of our capital position and our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $21.2 billion at quarter-end reflects an increase of $818 million over first quarter 2016. The debt-to-capital ratio of 23.1% is 3 points higher than prior year due to the issuance of $1.25 billion in senior unsecured debt in December 2016 to fund the acquisition of SquareTrade. We also held $2.7 billion in deployable holding company assets at quarter-end.","Book value per share of $52.41 increased by 7.2% over first quarter 2016 primarily due to retained income. We returned $371 million in cash to common shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of 3.2 million shares for $249 million and $122 million in shareholders' dividend. At the end of the first quarter, there was $442 million remaining on the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization.","Now I'll ask Jonathan to open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. Two hopefully quick questions: one Allstate, one SquareTrade. Let's just say that you guys have the pricing right and everything's good to go. I know you do have Esurance, you have Encompass, but really Allstate brand is the main driver here. What's going to make sure you get the maximized shots on goal? How do you get people into the stores compared to a Progressive that's online or independent agencies? Are you going to have a chance to reach all the possible customers you want to?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Josh, thanks for the question. This is Tom. I'll start and then Matt can talk about the things we're doing to make sure we grow all of our businesses. But first, if you go back to slide 3, it's really about creating shareholder value and improving our long-term strategic position at the same time. So, both today and tomorrow, right? And so, remember, the left-hand side of that, those are the low unit growth markets like auto and home insurance. And our strategy there is to really match value and price. So we have, of course, our trusted advisor initiatives. We're doing the Allstate agencies, Esurance's, raising customer satisfaction and doing more stuff online, more electronically.","And in those businesses, once you get done matching value and price, you just have to make sure you're looking at both share of market and share of profits. We manage both of those. We're not interested in taking share and losing money nor are we interested in not having many customers and making a high return. So it's a share of both market and profits.","When you look around the higher growth markets like Allstate Benefits, we've had a 9% compound annual growth rate in the business for 17 years running. And we get mid-teens returns in that business. So we, obviously, try to grow quite rapidly there. In the newer emerging markets, things like Arity, our new Roadside model, our SquareTrade, it's really about building a stronger strategic position, which includes both growth and building out our skill and capabilities.","Matt, maybe you want to talk specifically about, Josh \u2013 and, Josh, I think you're talking about auto insurance.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Allstate brand to understanding how it grows.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Josh, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. I think one of the core fundamental assumptions you have to have is that despite the fact that we have a four-square, I would not describe the four-square quite the way you implied in your question. It's not really pure trade-offs. It's not as if in the lower left, the Allstate brand is not providing technology support for online lead generation or self-service capabilities. It's really our goal in the Allstate brand is to provide many, if not all, of the same tools, capabilities and points of convenience that are available for the lower right quadrants or the upper left quadrant, plus the local advice and service of an Allstate agency owner. So I don't think of it as us naturally limiting ourselves to a sub-segment.","We're certainly focused there, because that's where we believe we're focused in the Allstate brand on those people with a bias towards a branded product and local advice and service. But we don't ask them to give up things. We don't ask them to give up the capability for using technology or self-service capabilities. So we believe our growth prospects are quite strong because we believe we're offering something few, if any, are able to do. We're offering quality products at a fair price, good value features and the special expertise of local trusted advisors in the community.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, I realize you have all the fingers in the pie, let's see what happens. Let's talk about SquareTrade a little bit. I'm surprised, my reading \u2013 if I read you right, you're actually taking more underwriting risk at SquareTrade. I thought that was in the distance as you get the capability. Maybe I misunderstood a little bit. To what extent are you going to be making underwriting gains and losses at SquareTrade versus how much you're receiving to partner channels and whatnot? And what's the timeline we should think about in understanding the learning curve for Allstate?","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Josh, it's Don Civgin. SquareTrade, since we just closed the transaction, at the moment, they're retaining their existing agreements as far as underwriting the paper and so forth. So we don't have any risk at this point. We do intend to transition to the Allstate taking the risk in the future. I don't want to give you a timeline as to exactly when we're going to do that, but we need to get ourselves lined up to do it. We're working on it and there's no reason that we shouldn't take that risk to Allstate.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So what does that mean when you cite a combined ratio? What numbers \u2013 is the combined ratio at SquareTrade the entity based on its partners or just the Allstate portion of what's going on?","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","It's just the Allstate portion of what's going on.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And there's premiums coming in, I guess, to Allstate. I guess, I don't understand why, if you guys aren't taking risk, I thought you (28:17) commissions, not necessarily premium volume?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","It's a little confusing. I understand what you're saying. It doesn't sound like a normal combined ratio. Over time, it will start to look more like a normal combined ratio. But as Don pointed out, we, of course, see most of the underwriting risk in a quarter actually to a third-party. We're working on bringing that back in-house. So we will actually and want to underwrite the risk. It will add to our return on capital and add to our profitability.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, team Allstate. I wanted to come back at you with another question around your competitive positioning. With an 84.8% underlying combined ratio at Allstate and then 90.9% in the Allstate brand auto, do you think you might be getting to a point where you're at a competitive disadvantage from a pricing perspective? Or maybe a better way to ask the question would be is, what's the right long-term target for the underlying combined ratio as we think about it?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Hey, Greg, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. So, this is what we spend the vast majority of our time doing, which is trying to ensure that we're walking that fine balance between profitability and long-term growth potential to maximize shareholder value in the long term. And I don't believe that we are placing ourselves at a competitive disadvantage.","I think we got out in front of the frequency spike. We reacted quickly. We reacted strongly. And we, in my opinion, have put it, for the most part, behind us. There's, of course, a few geographical exceptions to that. But as a general matter, we believe we've essentially caught up and we are now able to react to and price to emerging trends in frequency and severity as they appear. And we feel very good about that position.","We do not believe we overshot the target. We benefited in this quarter from significantly better weather and frequency results in January and February than I think is either sustainable or that was expected. We saw March return to something much more like fourth quarter of 2016.","And so, we believe that we are positioned very well. It's all a question now \u2013 when you have a complex decentralized entrepreneurial system as we do, it's now a question of building momentum again for growth within that system. And because it's a complex system, there's a time lag. There's a time lag both ways. But once that momentum gets built, it's a very powerful flywheel. And that's really built through agent confidence in their investment, since it's an entrepreneurial system.","And in large part, it's not just the result of how much we invest in marketing and lead generation; it's whether or not the agencies and the agency owners are investing and whether they're adding staff, whether they're putting money in local marketing funds and lead generation. And as they see our competitive position improving, as they see shopping behavior triggered by competitor rate actions, and as they see our rate taking stabilize and moderate, they're in a much stronger position to invest and for us to begin the momentum on the growth side.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Excellent color. Maybe, I guess, slightly technical, but you have reported favorable reserve development in the last couple of quarters. And I'm just curious what the underlying trends are there that are driving that favorable reserve development. Is that a trend that we should expect to continue?","Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.","So, Greg, this is Steve. When we look at the trends of our business, we've talked multiple times about how we set our reserves. We look at a lot of information. And at each quarter-end period, reporting period, we feel that our reserves are appropriately stated.","So things change. And as Matt has talked about last year on a number of occasions something called, we call, claims excellence, we're making changes in our claims practices. And over time, that develops and if you look at the reserves that we've been re-estimating in prior periods, a lot of it's just based on what we're seeing in terms of what we've been doing in our underlying practices. So, if you look at the reporting, it's across primarily Allstate brand, property \u2013 probably the (33:30) physical damage coverages have some of the favorable impact as do the injury coverages, which are over a period of time.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So just, Steve (33:38)","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Greg, if you remember, Matt I think mentioned it last time. When we do our claim reserves, we count frequency, we look at how many claims we have, we look at what type of claims. Some people do their reserves based on a targeted loss ratio. They say this book of business we're going to get a 70% and they book to 70% until such time as they see something differently. We do it from the ground-up that gives us a slightly different pattern the way we do it.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great answers. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just first on the guidance. Curious in your thought process why you didn't lower the underlying combined ratio outlook given the 85% this quarter and how much was that result helped by mild weather?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sarah, thank you for the comment. On the guidance, one quarter does not a year make. We've made this \u2013 that number every year since I started doing it, I don't know, 10 or 11 years ago. We do it so we're going to be in the range. We still think 87 to 89 is good. Matt mentioned that we had pretty good frequency in January and February. We don't expect January and February frequency results to be reflected throughout the entire year. So, we're still comfortable with 87 to 89.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the mild weather, was that about 1 point, 2 points?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","That kind of variance analysis is almost impossible to do because it, of course, varies by geography, by time of day, and trying to get the weather analysis down to be that specific. That said, if you look at our results and you compare them to the only other real public competitor where you can see monthly results, if you look at Progressive's monthly results, they were down in the 3% to 4% of frequency in January and February and then about a third of that down in March. Our overall results underlying combined ratio was 2 or 3 points better than theirs in total, but our trend looks similar to theirs.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then one of your largest competitor, State Farm, had a big auto underwriting loss in 2016. So, are you seeing any opportunity to take some profitable market share now that you've fixed your auto business?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, I think that it's sort of like middlings of (36:22) Josh's and Greg's question. Maybe take Matt's comments, put a \u2013 do a little competitive comparison to it to help (36:31). I think the answer is yes, we think we're positioned to start to grow again, but it takes a while. , Matt mentioned this is \u2013 our proprietary channel is, as Josh pointed out, is most of the business and it's a really powerful channel, man. When you want to get something done, whether that's change your risk profile, get margin initiatives going, you can move that channel because you're in effect completely aligned with them in terms of your business objectives. And that also includes growth.","That said, there's somewhat of a lagging growth because, as Matt talked about, that business, it works as a combined system as opposed to \u2013 this is where I can maybe help you see the comparison. If you're an independent agency company, the flow coming through those independent agencies as new business is pretty much the same. Who gets it? It's different. So, if an agency is writing 100 units a month and you've got 20% of them and you decide you're getting 20 a month and then you decide you want less, you get 10. If six months later you decide you want to go back to getting 20%, you can get 20 again. That said, it's a jump hole and you got to fight for that business on largely a price basis.","In our system, it takes a little longer to get going and drive their growth up than an independent agency channel. But it's much more sustainable. And you can build a stronger economic value proposition with longer lifetime values.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. The growth comments you made, are they uniform across the distribution systems? Obviously, I know you've already spoken about the Allstate brand business, but what about the growth of the other pieces?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","It's Matt. I'll start with Encompass and then I'll pass it over to Don for some comments on Esurance. I'd tell you it's similar, although it's delayed. So, first of all, within the Encompass system, we are a smaller system than the Allstate branded system. As a result, it doesn't have the benefits \u2013 the same benefits of scale as the Allstate system. It's more volatile, it's more subject to odd outsized results, both negative and positive, depending upon weather fluctuations and cats. But it also has a 12-month policy, which delays the earn-in rate and the effectiveness of some of the rate actions.","So, while I think we started the response to the frequency spike at a similar time within the Encompass channel, it will take longer before they emerge the way that the Allstate brand has emerged. That's not to say we don't see improvement already in certain geographies. It's going through quite nicely. We do have the advantage there, as Tom just talked about, that's an independent agency system. So when we decide to retract or retrench in a state, we can do it pretty quickly. And when we are in a profit challenged state, we can decide to pull back and impact the results fairly significantly and fairly quickly, which we're not able to do quite the same way in an Allstate proprietary channel. So the takeaway is you will see the same dynamics, but there'll be a little more volatility in the Encompass side and it will take about 12 to 18 months longer than it has on the Allstate side.","And now I'll pass it over to Don to talk a little bit about Esurance.","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Esurance is a little different as well for a variety of different reasons. Obviously, it's a different customer mix, it's a slightly different product. We do our own pricing and we have our own loss trends we watch and so forth. But it's also a direct business, which means in some ways it can react more quickly.","We acquired Esurance a little over five years ago. It basically doubled in the first four years. So we know it can grow. And we know the brand particularly with Allstate behind it can work. But having said that, the combined ratio was getting higher. And maybe it wasn't as big a deal when it was only $850 million in premium. But when it doubles, it begins to impact the corporation's results as well. So we decided to focus on achieving more profit \u2013 more GAAP profitability. I think we've said consistently over the years, we run Esurance on an economic basis, so we simply want to make sure that we're writing business that's good over its lifetime. And the accounting convention related to direct businesses where you expense the marketing in the quarter you take it, it creates kind of a discount annuity between GAAP and the economic numbers.","So I'm really pleased that they've been able to do that. I know Steve mentioned that they've been focused on achieving profitability and improving the customer experience. They've made great progress on both those fronts. When you look at the combined ratio this last quarter, it's down substantially. And if you look at the trend, not just year-over-year but sequentially, it's down. I like where the underlying loss ratio is. I like what they've done with expenses. But the reality is they only grew 1% in written premium. So we would like to see them return to growth, but with the underpinnings of having the profitability where they want to be. Once they begin to pivot off that, I think it will occur probably faster because it's direct as opposed to going through the agency force and their policies are six-month policies as well.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And my second question relates to the distribution expansion that you've talked about as well. If you could just give us some more details about exactly how that's progressing and number of agents and where the distribution is expanding. I assume that you're usually talking about the Allstate branded product when you're talking about this expansion of distribution.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So, if your question is about the Allstate brand, we can do that. But we, obviously, have distribution through benefit brokers with Allstate Benefits. We do most major retailers now with SquareTrade. We have lots \u2013 made (43:26) thousands of other distribution points, whether it be auto dealers, third-party arrangements we have with telcos and auto companies on Roadside. But \u2013 so I \u2013 zooming in on Allstate. And Matt can talk about that if that's okay.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. No, I'm most interested in that. Obviously, I recognize that distribution is broadening out to other places, but I'm most interested in that resumption of the actual distribution growth in the Allstate branded business.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Sure. Paul, it's Matt. Well, as you know, we've disclosed in the investor supplement some of the agency data, they're Allstate agencies and licensed sales professionals and Allstate independent agencies. So I'll refer you to page 14 of the investor supp for that data. But let me just give you some color on it.","One of the most difficult things to do during a time that you're taking a lot of rate to catch up to a frequency or severity spike is to add new agency owners because they depend exclusively on their ability to put on new business. They don't have an in-force (44:33) to rely on. And as a result, during that period of time from late 2014 through 2015 and the beginning of 2016, it was exceptionally difficult for us to maintain what has been our historical pattern of adding agency owners each and every year, each of them adding licensed sales professionals and also growing exclusive financial specialists to partner with them.","And so during that period of time that we were focused on rate, the ability to add the newer agencies was diminished. And so what we focused on there was encouraging our existing agencies to add licensed sales professionals and to open up satellite agencies and branches. But it was difficult to start scratch agencies.","What we've been able to do now is to reinvigorate that effort. And that is an effort that I would say is geographically focused, in that it is strategic deployment where we go through a fairly thorough and sophisticated analysis of market potential by geography in order to decide where to place them. But it's so dispersed, I can't tell you it's concentrated in one particular area, other than to say that we try to go where we haven't been before. And so there are vast areas of the United States and even within our existing states areas where we've historically not had Allstate agencies that we are intentionally putting on those Allstate agencies.","We've also changed our deployment plans. So new agency owners coming into the system are coming in with three licensed sales professionals as opposed to our historical pattern of one or two. And so, as they come on, they're able to get up to speed faster, they're able to have an impact faster, and we believe they'll be more sustainable.","So, it's a fairly significant effort. It is focused on all three prongs: exclusive agents, licensed sales professionals, and exclusive financial specialists. We have a couple of efforts within that to focus on veterans. We have a veterans licensed sales professional hiring initiative where we're partnering with several agencies within Department of Defense in order to provide job opportunities to returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. And we're quite pleased with that, not only because we think it's the right thing to do, but we're adding quality, already licensed sales professionals to our agency force.","So, the distribution focus and points of presence focus is an ongoing effort. As we've mentioned, it's a system. It takes a while to get that going. The classes take a while before they're up and running and before they'll have an impact. But we had a great first class in the first quarter, a fairly significant sized group. And the pipeline looks exceptional. We're putting in greater effort on recruiting. We have more assistance from the corporation in recruiting. The human resource area is helping provide it. We're using data analysis and decision sciences to help us recruit and select better. So it's a full-fledged, full force effort on the part of the corporation to improve points of presence.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had another question just to get a little bit more color on how you guys think through the growth that we're going to see on both new business and your retention stabilize and how that could pick up from here. I know when you think back over the past couple of years, a lot of hires in the auto space have kind of grown in to some margin problems, just given the elevated frequency and some companies seeing elevated severity trends. So how do you guys balance this renewed push to growth with the mindset of still looking to reach your margin goals?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Elyse, there's a lot in there. I mean, maybe a little \u2013 overall, we think as the competitors who we follow publicly and then we, of course, follow all the mutuals in terms of their filings and their reciprocals, are increasing their prices, well, some of them quite rapidly. We think that will lead to increased shopping behavior. And Matt can talk about how we're capturing that through both new business and what that also does and then where we are in the pricing cycle, what that does for us on retention.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Elyse. It's an important issue. I also, though, I want to point out at the outset that for the most part, a lot of our conversations so far this morning on growth has been related to new business. But in fact, the biggest lever we have in total item growth is retention improvement. And when you look back to the timeframe that we were really growing a couple of years ago, retention was about 1 to 1.5 points higher than current levels. And that's very powerful thing at our retention levels and with our size of the in force.","So while we've talked a lot about points of presence and lead generation and increased investments in growth on the new business side, I don't want to discount the fact that really one of the most crucial leverage we have is on the retention side where we have a lot of energy and effort to improve the retention, especially first retention in our book, we have a whole new onboarding process. We have a whole lot of work being done, again, with data analytics and emerging technologies to change the onboarding and the initial experience with our new customers to ensure that their initial experience is as strong as possible.","And we think that now that we're moderating our rate, we are going to trigger less shopping behavior on our customers and improve retention. At the same time, many of our competitors are still taking fairly outsized levels of rate and triggering shopping behavior on theirs. So, to the extent they're taking higher rate levels than we are, we're moderating ours, we believe that we'll be able to benefit from that and capture some of those customers.","The balance with our profitability, we feel, as I've said, really good about it. We believe that our approach to the business, and you can look back over the years; we have a tremendously strong profitability muscle. It's a natural muscle of this organization. If you know the movie The Blind Side, our natural reaction is protect profitability and we do that innately and intensely. That being said, we're excited about our growth possibilities with those newly restored margins.","And the final comment I'd make is, remember that this is geography-by-geography and we approach it on a micro basis. So, some of the things I'm talking about are general comments. When you go state-by-state and sub-geography-by-sub-geography, there will be different dynamics. In some areas, we're way ahead of the game and our profitability is fully restored and we have the foot on the gas completely. There are other geographies where we still have a little more work to do and we will maintain our margin discipline before putting the foot on the gas on growth.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Elyse, one other factor is, Matt was talking about our second objective, make sure we achieve the target return on economic capital. Our first corporate objective is better serve our customers. We measure that by Net Promoter Score. And the Net Promoter Score was up in the first quarter. So, just as we overachieved our combined ratio goal for the first quarter, we feel like we overachieved on our Net Promoter Score, which leads to exactly what Matt's talking about, point of retention to point of growth.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just tying together some of this commentary. As I look at the Allstate brand auto book and the underlying loss ratio within that, obviously, there was some favorable frequency trends that you pointed to in the Q1. As you think about improving your retention, some new business growth combined with still taking rate on areas of the country that aren't at profitable levels, I mean, do you see the kind of ex favorable frequency underlying loss ratio within that book still continuing to improve from here?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","It's really hard to project what frequency is going to do from here. What we do is just when we see it, we react. I think the point Matt made, which is we're not behind the curve now. We're at where we need to be. So, if things happen, we can adjust in there. You have to do it a little more aggressively if it moves quickly. So, if it was to move like it did in 2015, we might have to go right back to what we did again. If it is more normal and less out of pattern, then the impact on our business would be substantially less than it has been in the last two years.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Al Copersino from Columbia Management. Your question, please.","Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC","Well, thank you. I certainly appreciate that you guys have improved the claims management process as far as BI goes. I'm looking at slide 6. And Allstate has always been very good at making sure they don't pay claims they're not supposed to pay. One question for you, though, is it possible to get a sense and if you can't do it numerically, maybe more subjectively, is it possible to get a sense as to what these frequency and severity numbers for BI severity on slide 6 would have looked like under the old system? I'm just trying to get a sense if we're at any sort of inflection point or not.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Hi. It's Matt. I think if you look at PD, paid frequency and severity trends, you get a little bit of an insight into overall trends in the business. I remind you that one of the problems with looking at the BI chart on the lower right is that's paid frequency and paid severity, which is a little more volatile. So, it's influenced a little bit more by the mix. You could have one large loss in there that throws it off. So it's not mathematical. You can't just take 25.1% and minus the 20.5% and come up with the answer. You have to do it on a longer-term basis.","I'll go back to something that Steve said and that Tom referenced. We feel comfortable that our BI trends, our incurred severity trends are where they should be, based upon medical inflation and all the work we're doing to manage claims cost. We are laser-focused on it, as we should be, to pay the right amount, a fair amount and the amount that the customer or the injured party deserves, but not more and not less.","And so, the process enhancements are working. We feel good about them. As Tom mentioned, reserving is not impacted because we take into account in the reserving exercise all of these process changes and operational changes and incurred trends and pay trends. And so, I don't want you to think that the distortion caused by some of our operational excellence things influence our reserving trends. They don't. We're well aware of those and at the time we do the reserving, that's all factored in.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","If you're thinking longer term, right, so there's always this question about with machine-to-machine communication, smart cards, antilock brakes, all the safety stuff, there will probably be fewer accidents in the future. We, of course, didn't see that in the last couple of years. And that you could make the same argument about fewer bodily injury accidents or bodily injuries because of airbags and safety equipment. But we haven't seen any big break there. So there's nothing changing from a long-term standpoint. What Matt is referring to is just the way we count.","Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC","Well, that's helpful. I appreciate that. I have one other question, if I could, which is, I guess, a bigger picture question. The Allstate captive agency is just a tremendous asset. And as you guys said, you've been very focused on profitability there. You've always taken profitability over growth. At the same time, though, we have other businesses which have been \u2013 I think have been dilutive to your margins, dilutive to returns, whether it's Encompass or Esurance, or now with SquareTrade. And I'm trying to square these two things. Because you have been so disciplined on the Allstate side, but yet we've expanded into other distribution areas to increase the volume that Allstate has available to it, but at the harm of returns and margins. I just wonder if you could talk about that, Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, I will. So, if you go back to page 3, what you referred to is really the left hand side of the page where we know how to both moderate our market share and our profit share quite effectively. When you start to walk around the top, the life and retirement piece off the top, we get good low teens return on life business, it works well with our agencies, it broadens us, so that's a value-adder. Allstate Benefits, I mentioned, gets mid-teens and is growing quite rapidly. Allstate Annuities is a detractor, as you point out. We'd stop writing that business.","In addition, we took an action which hurts ROE but helps long-term shareholder value, but we did it on purpose. And that is so we have some long-dated payout annuities, about $12 billion of them. And really, that's like a pension fund. And so you should be more invested in equity life securities. The capital charges associated with that are substantially higher than it would be by having fixed income, even though economically it is absolutely the right thing to do. So we decided to take the ROE hit and increase shareholder value. When you look at our actuarial stuff, assuming it all pans out, that was a good move. So that one, the Allstate Annuities, is a drag on it.","When you look at Roadside, we have a new fulfillment model. We get about 5 million claims a year. We've improved the average time of arrival by about 30% with our new fulfillment model. And it is about $400 million business in revenues. If you were to put that business outside the company, it would have higher value. I believe people would look at it and think it's a fabulous business. You might say, well, why don't you get rid of it? Because it's really linked to Arity, which is down below, which is our connected car business. And that's a place where we're building a strategic platform so that we can leverage our position on the left-hand side with our customers to really both improve their business with Arity, do better pricing, give more effective Roadside Service, but also maybe offer that to other people.","Dealer Services is a business whose profit has gone down. It's a relatively small piece. And then SquareTrade, of course, we bought and we said it is dilutive, but we think broadening our product portfolio to include computers and TVs and cell phones makes a lot of sense to us and the broader distribution through all the major retailers offers lots of growth potential.","So it's about balancing overall growth and we try to do that both with individual things. We hold each of them through their own individual standards. So, Don said we backed up on Encompass \u2013 on Esurance. We're going to keep growing Esurance, but we decided it has to be economically viable. We apply that same logic to all the businesses, but with the goal of making sure we build a broad-based strategic platform that can weather all kinds of changes.","Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","And this should be our last call or comment \u2013 or question, Jonathan. So, Jay, shoot away.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I'll try to make it a good one. Going back to catastrophe losses in the quarter, it's the worse catastrophe quarter for the U.S. insurance industry in at least 20 years. And I think it's worth noting that a 10-point impact on Allstate's combined ratio is obviously manageable within the scope of that damage. Can you talk a little bit about what the company's done either from a policy term standpoint or broader risk management that kept the impact of those catastrophes on Allstate's results in check?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Jay, it's Matt. Well, we don't like a 9.8% combined ratio impact, but it could have been a lot worse. We spent a tremendous amount of time working on PML optimization, PML, probable maximum loss work, and risk concentration work to try to spread out and diversify our risk. We use our economic capital model in a fairly sophisticated manner to ensure we are earning appropriate returns based upon the risk in those specific geographies so that when something like this happens, we feel okay about it and we can focus where we should be focused, which is on serving our customers and helping restore them back to normal.","I would point out, unfortunately, in an organization like Encompass, which doesn't have the scale benefits and as a result, the diversification benefits, that hailstorm and the catastrophe in March had a greater impact on \u2013 proportional impact on Encompass than it did on Allstate brand despite the fact that we've done great work there over the last several years to reduce the risk concentration. But nevertheless, when you have a smaller business like that, it's just not as diversified, which is why we have a two-part program going on right now in Encompass, which is to retrench from those states in which we're not earning an appropriate return and grow in other states where we believe that we can earn an appropriate return and, therefore, diversify our risk.","Within the Allstate brand, we do, as I say, lots of offsetting work and offsetting trades. It's interesting that you can add some homes on Long Island and therefore be able to grow a little bit in Harris County. You're seen announcements that we're doing limited selective homeowners writing again in California and Florida, and that's because our diversification work and PML work has been successful and we feel that those additional added items will actually be helpful to our diversification and not pose undue risk.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Okay. Well, looking forward, we're going to stay as focused on those five operating priorities for 2017, make sure we're balancing the short term and the long term in a way that enables us to create value for our customers, our shareholders, and all of our stakeholders. So, thank you. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Director of Investor Relations.","Please go ahead.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and Steve Shebik, we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter, posted a slide presentation to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted an update to the description of our reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q for the second quarter, slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website. We're recording the call today and a replay will be available following its conclusion.","I, along with Steve Shebik, will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","And now, let's begin with Tom Wilson.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning and thank you for investing your time to keep updated on Allstate's progress.","In addition to Pat and Steve with us today in the room is the team that delivered these results. Matt Winter, who leads Allstate personal lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's second quarter results demonstrated our ability to concurrently grow the business and generate attractive returns. Our strategy to create unique customer value propositions for each consumer segment is working and has helped us compete in new and different ways. So in the last 12 months, we've added almost 750,000 Property-Liability policies in force.","In addition, we added another 900,000 relationships through our Good Hands Roadside in Allstate Benefits offerings. Positive growth momentum is building, particularly in the Allstate brand.","Secondly, we made good progress on all of our 2014 operating priorities.","Third, we recorded very good financial results. Net income was $614 million for the quarter, which you can see in that bottom table, which was higher than last year since there was a loss on the extinguishment of high-cost debt in the 2013 results.","Operating income was $1.01 per share, excellent results in light of incurring $936 million of catastrophe losses. Strong underlying profitability, lower expenses and good investment results all contributed to the positive operating result. The decline in operating earnings versus the prior year was due to higher catastrophe losses.","Lastly, we improved our financial strength while returning capital to shareholders. The 18-month $2.5 billion share repurchase program approved in February is now 40% complete after 4 months. Open-market purchases were made throughout the quarter to accelerate the stock repurchase program and the company share repurchases, which were alongside that program. I think, when you look at the supplemental number of people that didn't understand the fact that the company's repurchases are in addition to the open-market purchases made under the ASR.","Overall, we're executing well and we're poised to grow with attractive returns and further leverage our capabilities to create shareholder value.","We go to Slide 3, this visually combines our strategy and our current operating results for each customer segment. So overall, the 750,000 increase in Property-Liability policies represents a unit growth rate of 2.2%. Increased average premiums for our Allstate Protection net written premium growth to 5.5% over the prior year.","The reported combined ratio of 97.4% reflects 13 points of catastrophe losses. Therefore, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 84.7%.","Let's walk through each of the customer segments, starting with the Allstate brand, which represents 91% of written premiums. As you can see in the lower left quadrant, Auto policy growth increased again this quarter and was 2.3%. Working across the growth line, the decline in homeowners continues to shrink and was now down to 0.5% this quarter. Other personal lines are growing, bringing total policy in the fourth -- force growth in this segment to 1.5% and net written premium growth to 5%.","We're also pleased with the profitability in this segment with a recorded combined ratio of 95.4%, which you can see in the third line on the far right there. If you go back to the left, the Auto reported combined ratio was also 95.4%, which results from a disciplined and precise set of operating processes focused on matching price to risk and costs. We continue to have modest increases in Auto prices, which were up 0.5% this quarter, excluding Canada.","A few analyst called about the investor supplement, which shows no increase in total because it impacts a large mandatory reduction in Ontario auto pricing.","Another measure of Auto pricing discipline is average gross written premium, which is 2.6% higher than a year ago.","Moving to the next column. The reported homeowners combined ratio was 98.6%, despite almost 39 points of catastrophe losses. An underlying combined ratio of 60.2 for this product gives us confidence that we can create shareholder value and improve our competitive position by growing this line.","Esurance in the lower right had another quarter of strong growth with policies in force of 17.5%, although this is lower than last year, as expected. The combined ratio of this brand reflects the immediate expensing of acquisition costs has improved from last year due to profit-improvement actions taken to ensure we get acceptable economic returns.","Encompass in the upper left also continued to grow policies, but at a slower rate than last year, also as expected. With an underlying combined ratio of 94.8%, there's still more work to be done to raise returns.","Answer Financial sells nonproprietary policies, that's in the upper right, through the Web and call centers. Nonproprietary premium increased 12.6% over the prior year.","Our 5 operating priorities are shown on Slide 4. So we just covered the second quarter results on growth and profitability, so I'll give you a chance to just read the bullet points, then I'll move on to the next 3 priorities.","Investment returns were favorable in the quarter as higher limited partnership income more than offset the expected decline in interest income. You will remember the risk and return trade out we made in shortening the duration of the Property-Liability portfolio, which resulted in capital gains but lowered investment income by over $100 million annually.","Our efforts to modernize the operating model showed up in lower operating expenses at Allstate Financial, reflecting actions taken because of the sale of Lincoln Benefit. The benefit plan changes made in 2013 also led to lower expenses.","Long-term growth efforts include expanding our Allstate agency capacity in underserved markets. Allstate agencies are also investing in growth alongside the company, and collectively, we're working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of this powerful local model.","Esurance continue to expand its business and it offers auto insurance in 43 states; renters insurance in 18 states; motorcycle insurance in 9 states; and homeowners insurance in 7 states as of the end of the quarter, and we continue to expand that product portfolio throughout the year.","The breadth of this set of underwritten products is designed to give us a competitive advantage by better serving customers and lowering acquisition costs in comparison to other direct writers.","We're also investing aggressively in telematics and are achieving rapid growth in utilization of the Allstate-branded Drivewise and Esurance DriveSense offerings. We're testing additional features, which extend the benefits of being connected beyond more accurate pricing.","In summary, halfway through the year, we've made very good progress on our 2014 priorities.","Steve will now cover the operating results in greater detail.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter financial highlights on Slide 5.","Beginning with the upper left, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.2 billion in the second quarter was 5% higher than the second quarter of 2013. Recorded combined ratio of 97.4% increased 1.3 points versus the comparable 2013 quarter, driven by $936 million in catastrophe losses, which were 45% higher than the prior year.","The underlying combined ratio was an 84.7% for the second quarter and 86.6% year-to-date, which is below our full year outlook range of 87% to 89%.","Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 2.3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by limited partnership income. Property-Liability operating income in the second quarter was $364 million, 15.9% lower than the second quarter of 2013.","The Property-Liability combined ratio on a recorded underlying basis is shown in the chart on the upper right-hand side of this slide. You can see that while the recorded combined ratio rose in the second quarter due to catastrophe losses, the underlying combined ratio was very favorable, as we did not experience a repeat of the adverse weather encountered in the first quarter.","A tail below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio of trends by brand for the past 6 quarters. We have also broken out Esurance underlying loss ratio to remove the impact of investments in advertising and expansion, which are immediately expensed and provide greater transparency to our ongoing profit-improvement actions.","As Tom mentioned earlier, you can see the Esurance loss ratio starting to benefit from the actions that we've taken to date.","Allstate Financial, on the bottom half of the slide, had a 10.5% decrease in premiums and contract charges in the second quarter, resulting from the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Operating income of $165 million was a 5.1% improvement over the second quarter of 2013, driven by higher investment and benefit spreads and lower operating expenses.","Net income of $145 million for the second quarter includes an additional $13 million after-tax loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","Excluding LBL's second quarter 2013 results, operating income increased by 31%, and net income declined by 10.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Our second quarter 2014 10-Q and investor supplement both contained estimated historical results for Lincoln Benefit Life, provided with further contexts.","Allstate Financial is now a smaller but more focused company, but still capable of producing meaningful operating income.","On Slide 6, we showed net written premium and policies in force growth rates for Allstate Protection and by brand. For Allstate Protection, in the upper left chart, the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began in the second quarter of 2013. Policies have grown by 735,000 or 2.2% from last year's second quarter and 407,000 or 1.2% from yearend 2013.","Each brand where we accept underwriting risk achieved growth in the second quarter in both written premium and policies compared with the prior year quarter.","Moving over to the upper right chart. Allstate Brand policies ended the quarter 1.5% higher than the second quarter of 2013, growing 463,000 policies. The Allstate Brand grew net written premium 5% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter, driven by continued variable trends in new business, retention and higher average premium. Allstate Brand Auto net written premium increased 4.9% from the prior year, while policies rose 450,000 or 2.3% from the second quarter of 2013.","Allstate Brand homeowners net written premium grew 4.3%, while the rate of decline in policies in force slowed to 0.5% or 28,000 policies compared with the prior year quarter.","On the bottom 2 charts, you can see the growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Encompass policy in force growth continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to ensure acceptable, long-term returns. Net written premium growth of 8.3% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter 2013 reflects higher average premiums due to rate increases that are earning in over time.","Esurance's rate of premium and policy growth continues to slow due to its increasing size, as well as the ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitability.","Total Esurance premium has grown over 65% and policies in force over 80% since its acquisition in October of 2011.","Slide 7 highlights Allstate Brand auto and homeowners underlying margin trends. The charts on the left side show Allstate Brand auto and home combined ratio trends, while the charts on the right show quarterly change in earned premium and underwriting loss trends.","As you can see, while there's volatility in the trends in the charts on the right, longer-term, underlying combined ratio results on the left have been fairly stable and demonstrate the success we experience with maintaining auto margins while improving homeowners.","For Allstate Brand Auto, in the upper right-hand chart, we expect frequency results that performed within historical ranges in the second quarter, as the adverse impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter was not repeated.","Severity results showed only modest increase over the prior year, resulting in a decline in the average underlying loss in the second quarter of 1% compared with the second quarter of 2013. We continue to earn previously approved Auto rate increases as average earned premium increased 1.6% in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter.","For Allstate Brand homeowners, in the lower right-hand chart, we also experienced more favorable underlying losses in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Average earned premium continues to increase, although at a slowing rate as we approach rate adequacy in total.","We continue to take rate increases as needed in both lines to keep pace with loss trends and maintain our underlying combined ratio.","On Slide 8, in the top left graph, you see the composition of the investment portfolio and the impact of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which reduced the size of the portfolio by $12 million. Over time, we are shifting the portfolio composition to an asset mix we believe will have higher returns, relying less on interest-bearing assets and more on equity and other assets where return is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance.","Our total portfolio return presented in the top right was a strong 2.2% in the second quarter, reflecting increased fixed income valuations and positive equity market performance. You can see, however, the devaluation impact is highly variable, while the income yield has been relatively constant over the last 5 quarters.","Our second quarter investment income before expenses was $932 million, with a total portfolio yield of 4.7%. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income in yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which now comprise approximately 50% of the portfolio.","For the Property-Liability portfolio, in the lower left graph, the interest-bearing yield has stabilized after the 2013 rate risk reduction actions Tom mentioned, while the total yield illustrates the variability in income, then a result of equity investments, including our limited partnership investments.","The Allstate Financial Portfolio in the lower right graph trends more consistently. However, you can see the decline in our second quarter income driven by the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","Our capital position is strong.","Turning to Slide 9. On the left side, you can see the change in the composition of our capital structure over time from senior debt to hybrid debt and preferred stock. A pro forma view of our capital mix adjusted for the expected repayment of $650 million of senior debt in August is also shown on the far left bar.","We took advantage of favorable market conditions in the second quarter, issued additional $250 million of noncumulative actual preferred stock, providing further financial and strategic flexibility.","During the quarter, we repurchased 142 million of common shares through open-market purchases and paid $125 million in common stock dividends for a total cash return to common shareholders of $267 million, bringing total common shareholder cash returns to $1,370,000,000 year-to-date.","We completed the accelerated share repurchase program announced in March on June 29, with receipt of 1.77 million in additional shares.","Book value per common share was a record $47.97, increasing 5.9% since yearend, and 15.2% since June 30th of last year. Our estimated statutory surplus at June 30 is $18 billion. Allstate Life distributed $700 million in a return of capital to its parent, the Allstate Esurance company during the quarter.","Our operating income return on equity was a strong 13.7% in the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, but lowered in the full year 2013 return of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses in the first half of this year, along with higher equity. The increased equity is a result of our 2013 benefit and planned assumption changes.","As you can see in the table in the upper right, average trailering equity is essentially flat from yearend 2013 to June 30. The impact of the benefit changes were entered into the calculation in the third quarter.","Overall, we continue to make good progress on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and our operating priorities in the second quarter.","Now let's open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The underlying P&C combined ratio of 84.7%, if my data is right, that's the best of any quarter in the past 6 years. So first, it's a great result. Second, just wanted to see if there was any lack of knockout weather or other factors that would cause that to be lower than you might think on a go-forward basis?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, make sure I get the second part of that question, so the question was whether weather had an impact on growth?","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No. I'm sorry. The underlying combined ratio of knockout weather or any other factors.","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes. First, thank you. We feel like we've made a lot of progress. Matt can talk about the underlying combined ratio.","Matthew E. Winter","Jay, there was nothing out of the ordinary this quarter from an underlying standpoint. As you know, we just had -- we had a lot of rate earning in, we had a fairly careful management of claims continuing and we had an underwriting expense ratio that was down. And as a result, all of the discipline that's been put into the business over the past many years is just starting to show through. Frequency improved, trends were broad-based, paid severity was pretty much in line on the BI side. On the PD, actually, we had some claims that shifted over from first quarter to second quarter because of such a high claim volume in the first quarter. So some third-party subro demands came in, in the second quarter. And so that just changed quarter-over-quarter a little bit on the PD side. But overall, there was nothing extraordinary there, nothing out of the ordinary. And we think it's just a continuation of the hard work that's been put into the business.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And then, the pace of share buybacks slowed pretty meaningfully in 2Q relative to 1Q. And as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the accelerated share repurchase program probably had a fair amount to do with that. But I'm just trying to get a better sense of what a normalized buyback pace might be on a go-forward perspective.","Steven E. Shebik","So as I said, we completed our accelerated share buyback program we started in March. I think, Tom noted, instead of June 29, it was actually July 29 that we completed it. When we got into a program like that, effectively we give the buyback program for that piece to another party, in this case, it was Barclays. So they buy over a period of time, in this case, 4 months. So we buy alongside them, but we effectively get a fair amount of the shares, from the money we provide to Barclays, upfront. So we recorded all that in the first quarter. So we had such a strong buyback number in the first quarter. In the second quarter is really open-market purchases alongside the program and that program has now ended this week and we are back in the market ourselves buying. So if you think we are -- it was announced within the $2.5 billion buyback over 18 months essentially, you do some division, it's about $150 million a month is kind of the ongoing rate we go and there are times when we accelerate that generally earlier in the program. Over the summer, we generally go a little bit slower than $150 million. Now we do have a strong capital position, clearly. So we have probably more flexibility than we've had in prior years when during the hurricane season, probably July to September, we'd slow down our program.","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, let me build on Steve's answer there. So we're 40% of the way done in 20% at the time. So there should be no confusion as to our commitment to do this aggressively. I think, what you do see is the way the numbers get accounted that makes it look like we're not active in the market. We're active in the market and we're aggressively buying back as much as we think is prudent, given the flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I want to pyramid into your bullet point on modernizing operating structure in Allstate Financial, just to get a sense of where the cost structure is on a go-forward basis. You have a program that reduce expenses, you're absorbing a little bit more of corporate overhead without Lincoln in the mix. When are you sort of at your right run rate of expenses and how much lower can it go from the current rate?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, let me make a comment about general corporate expenses. And then, Don can address Allstate Financial. So we've always been about reducing expenses, whether that be the benefit plan changes we talked about last year, which reduced expenses and you see ran through the P&L, or just our normal continuous improvement simplification. The benefit we now have is by growing revenues, you'll see more of that flow through the bottom line. So in the past, when revenues and PIF counts were going down, it's hard to get ahead of that in terms of your expense ratio. So what you should begin to see is our growth rate a little more incremental margin for us. And Don can talk specifically about Allstate Financial because he's doing a great job of getting ahead of the downsides in there.","Donald J. Bailey","All right. Thanks, Tom. So the strategy for Allstate Financial has been the same for a number of years, that's been to simplify our focus so that we're all about the Allstate customer and the Allstate Agency. The Lincoln benefit transaction, obviously, was an important step in that because it not only reduced the size of the balance sheet, allowed us to free up some capital for the parent company, but also then allowed us to focus all of our efforts on 1 distribution channel, which is the Allstate channel. There has been a lot of hard work, and thanks for noticing it, that has taken place to try and get our cost structure down because we're a smaller company. I think, we've made good progress, you see it in the numbers. At the same time, we're taking cost down, we're simplifying what we do so that we can be more effective, it's serving the Allstate customers and the Allstate agencies. We're not through the transition yet with Lincoln Benefit Life. We still have a good year or so of work to do to get that behind us. But I expect to see us continue to work hard to manage our expenses so that we can continue to deliver really strong operating results.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Bob, I'd just add 1 other point, as part of corporate overhead, I prefer to call it corporate value add.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Tom, you sort of anticipated my follow-up and gave a partial answer to the question I was going to ask which is on the PC side, you see it in the solid expense ratio improvements. Going forward, are we likely to see any underwriting improvement more likely to come from the expense ratio than a loss ratio given that you're saying you're trying to move rates up in line with loss cost growth?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll let Matt answer it for ff course, our biggest business, which is the Allstate agency piece. I would just point out, as it relates to Esurance, the expense ratio is dependent on how aggressively we want to grow the business and how much advertising we're doing.","Matthew E. Winter","Bob, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. We're looking -- we try to manage both components. I wouldn't say that we're trying to use 1 lever over the other lever. I think, we have to be conscious of and monitor and manage both the loss cause and the expense side of the house. As Tom mentioned, now that we're in growth mode, it gives us the flexibility of making some investments for the long term. It gives us the ability to leverage our scale and efficiency. It gives us the ability to do some things, some of the work we're doing now in continuous improvement to really go through some of our processes, really make sure they're as efficient, effective and customer-focused as possible. That will help us leverage our scale and size that will help us be more efficient. And so my expectation and the team's expectation is that we will be diligent on both components of the combined ratio and not look to just use 1 lever versus the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So listen, I wanted to switch gears a bit and talk a bit about growth. You guys have come out of a number of years of sort of stabilizing the business and shrinking volumes in some of your lines, you've been growing for the past year. Longer term, really interested in what you guys can do to get more leverage out of your -- the other core Allstate Agency platform. It sounds, from, what, your presentation this morning, that it sounds like you're starting to add agents again. Kind of curious if that's new headcount in agencies, is it new principals? And also, you've done a lot, I think, to sort of reposition the organization to focus more on cross-selling and trying to leverage benefits package and things like that. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of sort of broadly what you're doing? And then, for big picture, whether these are the sorts of things that can kind of help you maintain share, whether there's -- whether any of them are sort of material to allow them -- you to actually begin to grow unit volumes, say, in excess of household formations or something like that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me start with the last part, and Matt can give you the specifics on the Allstate Agency piece. So our overall plan to increase share of the business is really focused on having unique customer value propositions for each segment. And so Matt has a unique customer value proposition that for those people who want local advice and a branded product, he can talk about the things he's doing to make that resonate, which includes many of the things you mentioned. At the same time, we look at both share of revenue and policies, as well as share of profits. So as you know, the overall industry return in the property casualty business, broadly defined, including commercial and personal lines, is about 7%. We'd like to continue to maintain our attractive returns and have a greater share of that than we do the top line, we believe we can grow both with our differentiated proposition and Matt will talk about specifically what he's doing. And he is -- that business is building momentum, I feel good -- the flywheel is turning on that one.","Matthew E. Winter","Josh, thanks for your question. As you noted, there's been a fairly strong emphasis on getting the Allstate agency force growing again and getting the entire Allstate brand business growing again. So we look at it in a couple of different categories and we refer to capacity building, capability building and activity creation. And so on the capacity building, we are, in fact, increasing points of presence, points of distribution presence, both EAs and license sales professionals. So we do have a fairly significant and aggressive campaign to grow the Allstate agency force, but it is not just putting on numbers, it's putting on quality agencies in strategically deployed areas where we're under-penetrated and we believe that there's extra market potential. And we will continue to do that fairly aggressively because it's working for us, we're doing that in areas where we have not historically been able to penetrate. And we're using new and fairly creative methods of doing that, including the Allstate Auto dealer program, where we place Allstate agencies in car dealerships, which, in the heartland especially, is enabling us to service a very wide geographic area in a very efficient way. We're also using what was formerly the Allstate direct group in a support mode for the Allstate agencies, we call it the extra hands. And so we are deploying that large call center force to create additional capacity for the agencies, both after hours, weekends, and in additionally, for overflow, when they're capacity-constrained during the day. So in the capacity creation, lots of things going on that we think create long-term sustainable growth capacity. On the capabilities side, Tom has mentioned, I think, on several calls, our push to create an advisory capability within the Allstate agency and grow that. So we refer to it as trusted advisor. It's our initiative to focus the Allstate agency force on more advisory and service functions and less transactional functions where we believe their differentiation stands through to the customer base where we think that they provide extra value, where we de-commoditize Esurance and do not accept the fact that auto or homeowner insurance is merely a pricing play. That's truly just a commodity. We don't believe that and so we're expending a lot of energy and effort building the advisory capability within our Allstate agency force from a technology perspective, from a service perspective, information perspective, process and marketing perspective, you'll see a lot of our recent marketing and our agent recruiting materials are very focused on the trusted advisor piece. And on the activity side, we spent a lot of energy and effort improving our close rates, improving quote activity, improving retention through customer-focused experience work and other things to improve our relationships with our customers and retain them for a longer period of time. So on the activity side, we think we've been quite successful with our broadening the target, with our quote generation. And you'll see -- you have seen how that's flowed through in the Auto results. On the home side, as Tom mentioned, the deceleration in the decline in homeowners is just accelerating. So we are flattening out and positioning to grow there as well. And as Tom mentioned many times, our goal there has been to grow in a very disciplined manner so that the volatility of that line is still acceptable for our shareholders, our customers and for the corporation. And we think we've been pretty successful on that. If you just look at the last 8 quarters, we've had 8 consecutive quarters with a recorded combined ratio under 100. And during that time, we had $2.1 billion of underwriting income at a combined ratio of 83.1%, despite $2.5 billion in tax. That's a pretty significant event, that's a fairly significant accomplishment. And that has given us the confidence to begin growing the homeowners line again in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And when we look at that and we look at the underlying combined ratio during that same 8 quarter periods was 63.2%. And as we've said multiple times, our goal is to deliver low 60s combined ratio in the homeowners business and we did that in a period that included Superstorm Sandy and some of the worst winter weather we've seen in quite a while. So the last part of your question, which was the ability to cross-sell, we -- you've seen an uptick in our other personal lines business. You saw that in 2013 that, that line was declining. In 2014, we began growing again in that. Most of that growth is driven by renters and condo, which we think are very important to creating long-term relationships with our customers and enabling cross-sell of other products, including auto. It probably would have been faster had it not been for the decline in the involuntary auto piece of that line. And as you know, the involuntary auto is what we get depending upon whether other auto carriers, specifically in New York and New Jersey, accept higher-risk customers. And lately, they've accepted more customers. We've had less involuntary auto, and so that has slowed down the growth in other personal lines. But overall, we feel quite good about our ability to serve all the needs of our customers. We have stopped really referring to it as cross-sell and refer to it as providing household solutions to meet the needs of our customers. So we're not so interested in trying to acquire a customer and then push another product on them, but to acquire a customer and meet all of their needs and the needs of their households with our full product portfolio. So we feel quite good about our positioning for growth and our ability to sustain that growth over the long term.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Matt, that's really pretty comprehensive. I guess, maybe sort of a high-level question for Tom. You've increasingly given more visibility in your communications to all of us talking about telematics and you mentioned the strategic investments here today. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on how you guys thinking about sort of your go-to-market strategy is evolving in Esurance and Allstate? And big picture, is this something that's going to be a growth engine for you guys? Or is it more an opportunity to increase your connectivity with customers and something we should basically look for as a benefit to, say, retention, for example?","Thomas J. Wilson","It's a good question. I would say that the connected car space is developing rapidly. We're right in the middle of it and it's hard to determine exactly where it will come out. But I can give you the 3 components that we're working on. So first and most importantly, being able to be connected with our customers helps us get more accurate pricing on their behalf. And as we've talked about in the past, we're making estimates as to what an individual customer should have. We've been very good at that, and that's given us a competitive advantage. You can see that in the homeowner results that Matt was talking about. Knowing how a specific person drives gives us the ability to do an even better job, and we can provide them a 10% to 30% discount if in fact they connect with us. And it's every bit as powerful as credit, so we're actively and aggressively working to expand that portion of our business. Secondly, we're working to improve the driving experience. So we have a number of features that we're developing, which improves somebody's driving experience which takes their relationship with us essentially beyond auto insurance. We don't know where that will exactly come out yet, we're investing aggressively. And to Bob Glasspiegel's point, and what Matt said, was look, we invest where we want to invest, and we cut cost where we think it's not really adding customer value. In that component of our telematics offering, we're investing aggressively in trying to decide what are the number of alternatives. We've launched some new features last quarter on teen driving and we'll continue to roll out new features to better the driving experience. The last component of our offering is how do we best utilize and monetize some of the data that will be created from that connection on behalf of our customers. And we're collecting billions of miles of traffic data and all kinds of other data, how cars work, what they work, what they're like in different weather condition. And that is the most nascent of our efforts. It's not an area where we have a traditional source of expertise in monetizing data. I was very good in using data. And we make a lot of money by monetizing on behalf of our shareholders, how we help other people use that data and how we capture that revenue source on behalf of the company is yet to be determined. So it is both more accurate pricing, better experience which lead in part to retention. But we also think mainly to other revenue streams and then just solely new revenue streams. So it's really all 3 of those components.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, 1 question I had, sort of bigger picture, I mean, the homeowners trending well, underlyings are good, PIF trends moving in the right direction, auto underlying was nice, and it doesn't like -- or from your comments, it doesn't sounds like it was a one-off. Other personal lines growing, looks like low 80s underlying there. And then, Esurance is improving. So I'm just trying -- I guess, I'm trying to understand, your 87 to 89 combined as a target, it would seem that we're on a glide path to come in below that, unless I'm missing something. Can you comment on how we should think about that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Sure, Michael. First, we, of course, as you point out, we give an operating range of a couple of points for the year, at the beginning of the year, because we want you all to have some confidence that this is where we think the business will come out. And this year, we picked 87 to 89 which was a point lower than the range we had last year, which was reflective of our team -- here is confidence in the -- in all the metrics you just talked about. So for the first 6 months, I would point out, you're right, we're slightly below that in terms of the underlying combined ratio over towards the lower end. But as you also know, frequency can bounce around a good point in any period of time. So we don't feel any need to change that range. We don't do it to try to help people get -- do operating EPS calculation. We do it to give you a sense to how good we feel about the business. We still feel good about the business. We think 87 to 89 generates really attractive returns and we can grow in that range. So we don't have any plans to change it at this point. What I would take the opportunity to do is sales message, we saw all the things you talked about, that means evaluation should be a much higher multiple of both.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. That's fair. I guess, the other question I have was just, so would you guys calculate an industry loss estimate for 2Q just across the country? Because it looks like you guys are at about 900, just over that. I mean, I look at some industry loss estimates, it did show that 2Q was a relatively light quarter. Can you try to help -- I was trying to square that, is it where you're located or maybe just a conservative view of where losses may end up? I'm just trying to...","Thomas J. Wilson","Are you talking about auto and home?","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. So I mean, you're not -- looking at some cat losses for the second quarter, 930. It looks like industry loss estimates are somewhere in the $6 billion to $7 billion range and that's commercial, personal, across-the-board and domestically. So I mean, just trying to square that versus your sort of market share.","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, I think, I would make 2 comments. One, it's a little early to figure out where exactly the industry is because people are just reporting now and it takes us a while to get the information. Secondly, we do obviously look externally at how our results compare to everybody else. But we break it down. We look in total, but we're really more concerned about what happens locally. So this is a local business. We underwrite price, do our agencies, everything is local. And so we would really look and say, well, how are we doing it in Colorado relative to other people in Colorado on all fronts. That would be not just in catastrophes, it would be BI, it would be physical damage. And we have a number of tools we use to do that. Obviously, starting with pricing, but going all the way through to claims or some industry databases we use on claims. And I think, the summary, I would say, of all that is the machine that we have in place, which is a set of business processes, disciplines, rewards, recognition, analytics, they help us maintain our profitability. And the zones we talked about is working, we think it's working well. We see Matt's team is adjusting where they need to adjust and that has obviously been through for a long time on auto insurance. You're now seeing that same discipline and set of practices being applied to the homeowner's business. And so we feel good about where we're at relative to the industry.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, just really quickly, Esurance, as your actions continue, I mean, it looks like you took mid single-digit rate, PIF is still in that high teens. What do you expect or what are you hoping to kind of get that to or when were you hoping to get that to sort of underlying profitability or at least getting that loss back down as close to 0 as possible?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll let Don talk about the specifics that they're doing at Esurance. I would tell you though, from a capital allocation standpoint, the conversations that Steve and I, and Don and I have about that business are it should grow as fast as they can, assuming we are earning above our cost of capital on the business that we write. If we're not getting the right return on it, then we're not interested in growing. The returns on the business we write are well above our cost of capital, slightly below what we would make in a large existing business like Allstate, which has a huge legacy book associated with generating a lot of profitability. But it's got to be profitable what we do.","Donald J. Bailey","I mean, there's a -- little I can add to that. I mean, the reality, our goal is to run Esurance in a way where we're economically profitable. What you're looking at is the GAAP profitability, which of course, is impacted by the fact that we're expensing the advertising upfront and there's also a couple of points of investment in other products and expansion that doesn't necessarily pay off in the quarter as well. I'm really pleased that the work that Gary and his team have done over the last year or so, the loss ratio is beginning to pay off. We're beginning to see it in the numbers with the loss ratio coming down again. So I feel good about where they are. We'd just like to see them continue to grow. And I don't think we want to put an artificial target of a GAAP combined ratio because I think that will stifle the growth that we're seeing at economic terms right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just first question is on the loss cost trend. If you would look at your Slide 7, it looks like both from auto and homeowner, the underlying loss trend have been ticking down from recent adequate levels. So could you give a little bit more color on that? And how do you think about sort of, in general, the economy, the inflation and as the economy recovering?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, Kai, it's Matt. Well, I'm looking at that, I looked at those same 2 charts on 7, and I look at it as kind of reverting more towards the norm. I don't see it as that much of a directional change. I think, we had an aberration on the auto side for a couple of quarters. It looks like it's stabilized where it should be and where it has been historically and the same on homeowners. So we feel very good about the underlying margin trends in both of those businesses. As we've been saying historically, we manage this very disciplined. We keep on top of loss cost and we keep on top of expense cost and we manage it on a micro basis for the benefit of the overall system. So we manage those in each geography and each micro-geography and the result of that is a systemic result that looks the way you see on these charts with positive long-term trends. From the overall economy, if you look at our current severity, we haven't seen that much of an impact from the inflationary trends. Obviously, there's some. But really, it's been relatively mild and relatively benign. Most of the severity fluctuations that we've seen have been the result of age of closures, geographic mix, policy limit shifts and things like I discussed earlier about just backlog of third-party subro demands and things like that. So, so far, the trends have been relatively benign. That being said, it's 1 of the reasons that we have to stay on top of taking rate, it's 1 of the reasons we thought it's so important to point out that we have continued to take rate on the Auto side even though it was masked a little bit by the Ontario rate decrease. We believe it's essential that we take rate as needed on a moderate basis consistently across the business. It's less disruptive to customers, it's less disruptive to the agency force, it improves retention and it allows us to stay ahead of any inflationary trends that might occur.","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me provide a point of clarification on these 2 charts on Page 7 as well. Obviously, 2 drivers of profitability are price and loss cost, and we've shown them to you because we think they're relevant. Unfortunately, I think, sometimes, it shifts the focus to just price as a tool to manage profitability. And let me expound on what Matt just said and give you the example of homeowners. So risk selection, product design, claims, performances, are all equally important to profitability. So if you look at homeowners over the last 5 years and you look at our cumulative price increases relative to our competitors, you're not really that much different at the end of this 5-year period. That said, we took a whole bunch of other actions, which give us the confidence that what we've done has made it sustainable. So for example, we used to have it as peak 7.8 million policies, we now have a little over 6 million. That's 1.8 million down. We're down 1.2 million just since 2009. What we do is went through re-underwrote the book, decided that those risker underpriced pieces of business we were no longer going to insure. We moved those to somebody else. We Improved. Matt's got a whole new set of inspection processes going on in terms of the way we look at new business. We obviously use sophisticated technology in claims. And then, they've redesigned the product in House & Home. I think, you're in what percentage of the country it is?","Matthew E. Winter","We're in about...","Steven E. Shebik","31 states and it's a growing percentage of the book of business.","Matthew E. Winter","It's about 12% of our overall book, 85% of our new business writings.","Thomas J. Wilson","So all of that stuff is underneath that story. So when we're -- I would encourage you to think about it, we have to look at these charts and show you price, but price is not the only tool we have to manage profitability. Matt was talking about that system. It has all of those tools available to it. And the strength of our execution is in being able to have a leadership that knows how to manage that well.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very comprehensive. Second question is on Encompass. It looks like that's the only segment you have year-over-year deterioration in terms of underlying combined ratio. I see that you're taking pricing action, as evidenced in the PIF growth slowing down. Could you talk a little bit more about the competition in the independent agency channel?","Unknown Executive","In Encompass, we're focused, as you know, on the mass affluent, and so we compete day-to-day with Met, Hanover, Chubb, AIG and Crestbrook. Right now, we see that it's competitive, certainly, but it's not irrational from a pricing perspective. We're still seeing really solid growth on our package policy, we had 10% quarter-over-quarter on our package policy growth, which now makes up the majority of our book. And we see more room, more elasticity in Auto. So if you look at Auto, quarter-over-quarter, we're up almost 2 points in retention. So that tells me we have more room to increase margin in the back half of the year and we plan to do that to get our underlying in line. With regard to deterioration you're seeing on the overall underlying of 2 points, you have some non-cat quoted weather in there, we had a really tough quarter in terms of weather and you have non-cat quoted weather, and you see the impact of a onetime rather sizable premium refund that's driving some of that, too. So all those things combined are driving that underlying. But overall, we still see room for margin expansion in the back half of the year. And if you look at the investor supplement, you'll see that we take most of our rates in the back half of the year on Encompass. And so, you'll see us earn an even more rate on Auto and Home as the year progresses. And we think we have room to do that.","Thomas J. Wilson","Why don't we do 1 more question?","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Back to Allstate Financial, the results were just excellent and it's not just on expenses. I know it's the spread of net investment income to interest credit after I take out the impact of Lincoln Benefit, it's also growing and the benefits to premium ratio has been declining. There's a lot of good stuff going on there. Can you sort of talk about not just the efficiencies, but actually the underlying profitability of the business, I guess, being generated, what's happening?","Steven E. Shebik","Yes, I'm happy to do that. I do feel good about the overall results at Allstate Financial. And the operating income, obviously, at $165 million, given the size of our business today, is a terrific result. We're hitting on a lot of cylinders, as you pointed out. It isn't just expenses. I think, benefit spread continues to be nice and stable and we're seeing good results on that year-over-year. Where we're seeing a really great result year-over-year is investment spread. So it looks, if you look at the reported numbers, we're up $12 million in investment spread. If you take out LBL, it was actually $68 million. And so we've talked about that in the past with the investment strategy we've taken, we are hoping for higher returns, we're expecting higher returns, it will come with some volatility and we're prepared for that. But at the moment, the investment income, benefit spread, expenses, everything has worked well for us and that's why you see the results you're seeing.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. Thank you all. I know there's number of calls today. So I'll close it off where we began. This quarter's results show the benefits of both having a focused strategy and solid execution. The net is growth at attractive returns.","Thank you very much, we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Well, thank you, Daniel. And good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Here today are Tom Wilson, CEO, Steve Shebik, Vice Chair; Mario Rizzo, CFO; Glenn Shapiro, President of Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, President of Service Businesses; John Dugenske, Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of our Life, Retirement, and Benefit businesses; and Eric Ferren, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we filed the 10-Q for the second quarter and posted the press release, investor supplement, and today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. Allstate continued to deliver excellent operating results, and we're on pace to achieve our 2018 operating priorities. The strategy to deliver differentiated products to consumers is laid out on slide 2 and is working.","So starting with our Property-Liability businesses on the left, we have four market-facing businesses each with a different customer value proposition and go-to-market business model. The Allstate Brand in the lower left competes in the local advise and branded segment and growth accelerated in the second quarter. Esurance in the lower right focuses on self-serve customers who preferred branded product and its premium increased 12.5% over the prior year. We leverage our pricing, analytical, and operating expertise across these businesses, which comprise 86% of revenues and 91% of adjusted net income, and create substantial value for our shareholders. Our focus on value creation also includes the four areas in the right panel. We're enhancing customer value propositions through increased connectivity. A good example of this is the use of telematics in the Allstate agency and Esurance businesses. We use connectivity to give customers a price for auto insurance that reflects individual driving behavior and give them the opportunity to buy it by the mile. So for those of you who are in New Jersey, you've likely seen our wraps on the ferries and in the advertising in the subway.","We're also working to improve our customers' driving experience by maintaining this connection beyond what's needed to create an Insurance Risk Score. QuickFoto Claim enables us to pay auto insurance claims in hours versus days. And we believe we lead the industry in implementing this technology, which is highlighted in our advertising. We also create value through growth in a number of large, significant businesses like Allstate Benefits, Allstate Life, and SquareTrade. The value of these businesses is substantial but can be overshadowed by the sheer size and scale of the Property-Liability business. As Mario will discuss, we also proactively manage capital to create shareholder value.","Turning to slide 3, Allstate's growth increased and returns were excellent in the quarter. Revenues exceeded $10 billion with increases in average premiums and policies in force. As you can see from the green box on the far right of the table, Allstate protection policies in force grew 0.9% in the second quarter of 2018, which is due to growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. Service Businesses grew policies in force nearly 36% due to SquareTrade. If you move back to the left, you'll see that net income was $637 million or $1.80 per share in the second quarter 2018, with adjusted net income of $675 million or $1.90 a share. In the middle at the bottom, net income return on equity was 17% and was 15.8% on adjusted net income. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio for the first half of 2018 was better than our annual outlook of 86 to 88, primarily driven by lower auto accident frequency. So given this positive result, the underlying combined ratio outlook improved to 85 to 87 for the full-year 2018.","If you turn to slide 4, we also made good progress on our five 2018 operating priorities. Those first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base, are intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. We've made progress on better serving customers as the Net Promoter Score improved across most of our businesses. Customer retention improved for both Allstate and the Esurance Property-Liability businesses, which is a key driver of growth. Returns were good in total as we just discussed. The Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 94.9, generated $416 million in underwriting income for the quarter. Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits also generated attractive returns.","Growth increased. Allstate and Esurance brands grew policies in force from higher and increased new business. Allstate continued its long track record of growth with policies in force growing 5.4% over the prior-year quarter. SquareTrade added 13.2 million policies over the last 12 months. The fourth priority, to proactivity manage investments, is imperative in a low interest rate but accelerating growth environment. The $83 billion investment portfolio generated $824 million in net investment income in the second quarter. Total return was 0.5%, as the contribution from investment income was partially offset by lower fixed income valuation. We're also committed to building new long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade and Arity are two good examples of progress on this priority.","John will now go through our Property-Liability results in more detail.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows an overview of our Property-Liability results. Net written premium growth of 6.4% in the second quarter was driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. The recorded combined ratio of 94.9 was 1.7 points better than the second quarter of 2017, due to increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses, higher favorable non-catastrophe prior-year reserve re-estimates and lower auto insurance accident frequency. This was partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio due to higher agent and employee-related compensation and technology costs. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates was 85.5 for second quarter of 2018 and 84.8 for the first six months of the year. As Tom mentioned, we are improving the guidance range by 1 point to 85 to 87 for the full-year 2018. This revised range takes into account more moderate frequency assumptions than originally planned, the seasonal nature of loss performance in the second half of the year, investments in growth initiatives, and the deployment of tax savings.","Now let's spend a few minutes discussing each brand in some detail. Slide 6 covers operating results for Allstate Brand auto insurance. Starting with the bottom left chart, policies in force grew by 262,000 or 1.3% in the second quarter of 2018. The Renewal ratio of 88.5 was an improvement of 1.1 points from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from our focus on the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, increasing 18% compared to the second quarter of 2017. On the right hand box, the recorded combined ratio for the second quarter was 93.0, 2.6 points better than the prior-year quarter and generated $358 million in underwriting income. The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average earned premium, higher favorable prior-year reserve re-estimates, lower catastrophe losses, and a broad-based decline in accident frequency. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8 in the second quarter of 2018 included an underlying loss ratio of 66.8, an improvement of 0.7 points compared to the prior-year quarter. This was more than offset by a higher expense ratio, driven by higher agent and employee-related compensation costs.","Let's go to slide 7 to cover Allstate Brand homeowners insurance results. Starting at the bottom left, policies in force grew 0.8% compared to the prior year, as both the renewal ratio and new issued applications increased. The bottom right chart provides detail on profitability. Homeowners insurance recorded combined ratio was 98.3 in the second quarter. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period given weather seasonality and variability. Allstate Brand homeowners insurance generated $932 million of underwriting income with a recorded combined ratio of 86.5 over the last 12 months.","Slide 8 provides financial highlights for Esurance and Encompass. Esurance had strong growth and improved underlying profitability in the quarter. Esurance net written premium grew 12.5% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting increased average premium in auto and homeowners insurance, and a 4.1% increase in total policies in force. This quarter's policy growth benefited from a 3.2% increase in auto insurance policies in force and the expansion into homeowners insurance. The recorded combined ratio of 101.9 in the second quarter was 4.2 points below the prior-year quarter, as shown on the upper right, due to the improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 was 4.6 points better than the prior-year quarter, as both auto and homeowners insurance results improved.","Encompass continues to execute its profit improvement plan and generated underwriting income in the quarter. There was a 6.6% decline in net written premium over the last 12 months and policies in force were 11.1% lower in 2018. Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 98.4 in the second quarter of 2018 was 6 points lower than the prior-year quarter, as the improvement in the underlying loss ratio more than offset expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 5.5 for the second quarter was 2.1 points better than the prior-year period due to increased average premium and auto insurance frequency.","And now I'll turn it over to Mario.","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 9, which provides detail on our Service Businesses. In the second quarter, revenue grew to $320 million, and policies in force reached 49.1 million. Adjusted net income was $1 million in the quarter, a $9 million improvement over the prior-year quarter, due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade and Allstate Dealer Services. SquareTrade revenues of $122 million were $52 million above the prior year with half the increase driven by organic revenue growth and the remainder due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. SquareTrade made progress on the three objectives supporting its acquisition as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved, and the international business expanded.","Turning to slide 10, let's review our Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. Allstate Life generated attractive returns on capital, with adjusted net income of $78 million in the second quarter shown in the bottom left chart. This was due to a lower effective tax rate, higher premium and increased net investment income. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income shown in the top middle chart on the page was $34 million in the second quarter. The $9 million increase from the prior-year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums, improved benefit ratio on selected products, and a lower effective tax rate. Allstate Annuities on the far right had adjusted net income of $44 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower performance-based investment results, compared to a very strong prior-year quarter, which remained low due to the relatively high regulatory capital rates.","Slide 11 highlights our investment results. We proactively manage our investment portfolio based on our long-term strategic risk profile, relevant market conditions, and corporate risk appetite. Net investment income was $824 million, 8.1% lower than the prior-year quarter, due to exceptional performance-based results in 2017. The chart at the bottom left of the slide shows net investment income split between the market and performance-based portfolios. Market-based investment income shown in blue increased and reflects higher portfolio yields. Performance-based investment income shown in gray was the primary driver of the decrease over 2017. While performance-based income in the quarter was lower than the last four quarters, this reflected very strong returns last year, due to favorable equity markets. The annualized yield on the performance-based portfolio was 9% this quarter, in comparison to 16.8% last year.","Total return in the quarter is shown on the lower right. The positive return in the quarter was supported by a stable contribution from income, shown in blue, but was dampened by lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields which is shown in gray. Total return was break-even for the first six months of 2018 as $1.6 billion of investment income was offset by a decline in the value of the portfolio, reflecting higher interest rates and wider credit spreads.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital strength. Adjusted net income return on equity, shown in the bottom left chart, was 15.8% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of 2.3 points compared to the prior-year period. Book value per share increased to $59.16 or 9.9% since the second quarter of 2017 as higher earnings and a 4.1% reduction in shares outstanding offset the impact of dividends, share repurchases, and a decline in fixed income unrealized gains and losses. Our capital position is excellent. And we returned $722 million to common shareholders in the second quarter. Since the end of 2012, we have reduced the number of shares outstanding by 132 million, or 28%, as shown in the bottom right chart.","Now we'll open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive environment. We're hearing that some competitors are starting to cut price. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts. Do you still think you can accelerate growth and maintain underlying margins in that environment over the next few years?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Morning, Sarah. This is Tom. I'll make a comment, and then Glenn may want to jump in here as well. First, I assume you're talking about just auto insurance as opposed to home insurance or any of the other things we do?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, yes. Sorry about that.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Okay, no. So in the auto insurance business that you've seen over the \u2013 so if you go back to 2015, 2016 \u2013 we were early on increasing prices. Other people \u2013 we saw that coming perhaps slightly earlier than some people. Then you saw a number of companies start to increase prices after that period of time. You see that moderating with many competitors now. But there are some, particularly one direct company, who's still taking some pretty big price increases, State Farm did recently reduce their price in a number of states. But I think you have to \u2013 rather than look at it on a percentage basis \u2013 think about what the absolute price is, because if you come down 2% or 3% but you're 10% higher than everyone else, it doesn't really matter that much. If you \u2013 it's all on what your absolute price is. And we feel very good with where our absolute price is today when we look at our close rates relative to number of quotes we get. So we feel good about where we're positioned in the industry and don't think there's any, like, big price war coming if that's what's in your mind. Glenn, maybe you want to add something to that?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, thanks, Tom. Just adding on, we do \u2013 we feel good about where we are competitively. We look at these rates on a state-by-state basis and we monitor the filings of all of our competitors. What we see is \u2013 yes, there's some slowdown, and Tom talked about one carrier that took some reductions as part of a change in their pricing, but we still see rate coming through the system. And if you look at the CPI, the first quarter was really high. On a year-over-year basis, it was, like, 9% in auto insurance. Year-to-date, we look at the most recent, it's still around 8%. A lot of that are the rates burning in that were taken in the last year. And we don't see as much filing activity right now. But there's still some. So it's still, I would call, a positive rate environment and we're well in the fact that we've taken those rates, good pricing position, to be stable for our customers.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, you talked a lot about frequency declining. To what extent do you think that persists? And is that factored in in your prices?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Glenn will talk about what we see to-date that's been realized. And then we'll come back to forecasting.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. So frequency, as Tom always says, there's a level of unpredictability to it. But there are components that we can have, both some facts on and some opinions on. So I'll talk internal and external. Internally, we like the quality of our book. If you look back over the past couple of years and we took some rates, those rates tended to shift the quality of our book because some of the less tenured business walked away from us as oppose to the more tenured business and higher risk business walked away more quickly than lower risk business, or quality improved. Then you look at the business we're bringing on and we like the growth that we're getting because about 70% of our growth is actually coming from improved retention, which is a nice way, nice balanced way to grow. And the other 30% that's coming from new business, we monitor the quality of that business and we feel good about the quality coming in as we look at the risk profile, the percentage of full coverage, the percentage bundled. All of that gives us confidence that we have a good quality coming into the book that's favorably impacted frequency. From an external standpoint, there's more of a mix of backed-in hypothesis. You've got the miles driven trends we look at and a number of other external trends. I would say automobile improvements that are driving less frequency are starting to burn into the overall car park \u2013 the car community that there's more lane departure warning and blind spot warning. And some of those things have a favorable impact. But all that said, there is a level of unpredictability as we've seen over the last few years that things can change in sort of the macroeconomic environment that moves frequency.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could compare and contrast the Milewise versus Drivewise. And some things are obvious. The pricing is different. But the level of connectivity and the level of customer interaction, I wonder if there's any differences there. And I'm also interested in your opinion of whether pay-by-the-mile insurance is likely to attract a large share of the auto insurance market over time.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Both important questions, Gary. I'll start and Glenn can jump in. So first, we're using increased connectivity for two purposes with our customers. One is to give them a more specific price relative to their individual driving behavior. And, two, to improve their driving experience. So the first piece is what many people in telematics are doing which is, you can look at not just where somebody garages their car or how they used to drive based on their motor vehicle records and claim behavior. But you can look at actually, where, when, and how they drive specifically that day. So that gives you a lot of options including Milewise. And Glenn can talk about Milewise. What we're in three states now. And particularly why we went to New Jersey. That'll give you some sense for how ubiquitous Milewise might end up being as a payment in pricing setup.","The second thing we're doing is working hard on using that connection to improve the driving experience, to improve customer loyalty and drive retention. So not everybody has taken this approach, but we maintain the connection, whether it's through your phone or your phone connected to an OBD port device to give you information about what the warning light is on your car. John a couple months ago, came in, had a warning light on his car. By the time he got to his desk, it said here's what's wrong with it, here's how serious it is, here's about what it'll cost, and here's three people you can connect to, to help you fix your car. You can also do things like finally resolve which of you or your significant others are really the better driver. So there's a lot of things we're trying to do to increase and take what is, oftentimes, a low engagement product into a high engagement product. Glenn, do you want to talk about Milewise and what you see there?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. So, Milewise, the early read I would say, very positive. I think there's a lot still to be determined. It's a good question about what percentage of the market it'll take. I can tell you the experience in expanding into New Jersey a few months ago, has been very favorably received. And I'll share an anecdote or two that will tell you how it works for folks. People intuitively, don't feel good about paying full freight if their car sits parked most of the time, because they use public transportation, they're in a metropolitan area. It doesn't make sense to them to pay those type of prices for full auto insurance when they don't use the car very much.","So we've had specific situations and really even in the first week after we launched I got some notes from agents that said I had a customer that's about to walk out the door with their business because they just felt like the rate was too much for the amount they used their car, and they wanted to get less coverage somewhere else. And I was able to save the business by saying, hey, this might make sense for you. So we're seeing really nice uptake. The early signs are very positive. It's still \u2013 it is a niche within our market \u2013 so the percentage remains to be seen. But I think it's an important niche, and potentially a growing niche, over time, with people that don't use their car primarily and use other sources.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Marcos Holanda - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Marcos calling in for Greg. My first question has to do with processes to control costs in the context of InsurTech. It seems like the next wave of operational efficiency for carriers following online quoting will be on the claim side. Do you guys agree with that? And can you perhaps talk about how the adoption of QuickFoto Claim is developing and what are some of the challenges there?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Marcos, I'll give you a perspective on what we would call integrated digital enterprise which we've been at for a number of years now. And then Glenn can give you an update on QuickFoto Claim without getting into any specific numbers because it's competitive, the information on what we're doing. But the combination of digital recognition technology, that's the ability of a computer to look at a picture and tell something from it is developing quite rapidly. And when you combine that with the ubiquitous amount of cameras out there, communication costs, and the ability to build new and more sophisticated algorithms which take that digital information and turn it in and use it for decision-making, it's going to dramatically change the business. Claims is clearly one of those places where it can change the business. And so we've put that \u2013 we're using that in QuickFoto Claim.","It can be used in many other parts of the business. So InsurTech goes well beyond just those experiences. So for example, we're just launching the ability to sell a homeowners policy by verifying three pieces of information rather than have our agency owners and licensed sales professionals be in the data collection business and answer \u2013 ask you a whole bunch of questions of which maybe you know, maybe you don't know, but we certainly can buy the information on digitally. So you're correct in saying that \u2013 and we have it separate, it's called integrated digital enterprise \u2013 which is to do that throughout our entire company.","Glenn, do you want to give an update on QuickFoto Claim?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, so very happy with what's going on in the adoption of QuickFoto Claim. And it's one of those change management exercises that at first it feels very big. It's a big shift for people. But a year and a half or so into a bigger launch of it, it's just the way we do business right now. And customers really like it. Our agents like it. The employees like working through it. And I'll break down the parts of work, if you just think about segments of work. Historically, about half of the units of work were getting the human to the car or the car to the human. And that was a customer effort. That was our effort for employees. In some way, we had to get the person that's going to write an estimate in front of that vehicle physically. The other half of the work was actually writing the estimate. So what Tom talked about is right on with photographs potentially doing that work through artificial intelligence on that piece. The QuickFoto was essentially eliminating that first half of the work. We didn't have to get the car to the human or the human to the car. The photos flowed through and we're able to, as Tom said in the opening, in hours settle claims that would take days previously. So very positive adoption. Very positive customer experience.","Marcos Holanda - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that color. My follow-up would be on SquareTrade. There was a nice uptick in PIF in the quarter but revenues came flat versus Q1 following several sequential quarters of improvement. So I guess just some color there?","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Marcos, it's Don. First, SquareTrade is off to a really great start with Allstate. When we did the acquisition, we set three goals. The first was to increase our business with domestic retailers, both with additional retailers as well as the business we do with the existing ones. Second was to improve the profitability, and you can see the improvement this quarter, partially as a result of us taking the underwriting risk but also the loss and the expenses have been trending very nicely as well.","And then the third was to build an additional platform for them for future growth. Europe has done quite well for them, and this quarter, we're seeing roughly double the volume. It's still fairly small, but double the volume we had last year. So specifically to your question, it's \u2013 you have to look a little bit beyond quarter-to-quarter, because it can be a little bit lumpy. You've got some seasonality in there. It depends on when you pick up additional retailers and when they begin to ramp up their program. So I think the better trend to look at is year-over-year. Now the numbers look a little exaggerated because of revenue recognition, but roughly half of the increase is organic. Part of that is picking up additional retailers, but part of it is just doing a better job with retailers we have and their customers. So, very happy with their progress thus far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. My first question is on the strong growth in Allstate Brand. That continues to accelerate each quarter. Just trying to get a perspective on if you would expect that trend to continue in the back half?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Jay, this is Tom. As you know we don't give guidance on either the top or the bottom line. When you look at the growth that you've \u2013 the first time we're \u2013 it's been year-over-year up, but if you look over the last three quarters, it's been headed in that direction. We were expecting it to continue to head in that direction. A key point I would note is that a significant portion of that growth is driven by retention. And that's a gift that keeps on giving.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Okay. Can you also discuss the strong growth in new applications in the Allstate Brand? What you view as the drivers there?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, this is Glenn. I'll take that, Jay. I'd really look across the whole system and what's gone on to drive the growth. So we've talked about going back over the past few years. There's been a plan that Matt had talked about the plans of how we're going to grow the distribution system and make it more effective. So we've increased our footprint. We're up, if you look year-over-year, about 1,600 points of presence between agencies and licensed sales professionals. We have them more engaged because they're winning in the market right now, so they're marketing locally and they're drawing those quotes in. They're hiring more staff. We've improved in meeting our customer needs because we have a higher percentage of full coverage and a higher percentage of bundling going into. And as Tom said, retention is up, driving a lot of the growth. And the more quoting activity is really those agents hunting within their markets and being effective marketing in those communities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hey, thanks. I had a follow-up on auto frequencies. And I appreciate \u2013 I know you guys used the terms, there's a level of unpredictability and there's hypothesis surrounding what drives them. But I was curious if Allstate has a view on whether the level of unpredictability or the volatility of frequency has changed on a go forward basis versus what it's been historically. Basically do you think there's consumer factors out there that should cause us to think it might be more or less volatile over time?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Mike, this is Tom. Maybe I'll take it and, Glenn, if you want to add at the end, jump in. So first, I understand the benefit of being able to determine what the trend is on frequency. And I know you \u2013 people have poked around at this with their competitors as well. You can actually make a sector prediction or you can access the individual company performance. That said, frequency falls into the known, unknown category as it relates to the future whether that it's absolute level or the volatility in it. And so we think the decision on frequency really ought to be based on the business model that is how good are the processes and people?","So \u2013 well, what, of course, we do know is there's been a long-term decline for a lot of good reasons, whether that's drunk driving laws and cultural unacceptability of drunk driving, antilock brakes, more cars per household. There's a variety of things. Which \u2013 now on the short term, of course there's a number of drivers which make it more unknown there. So it's a number of miles driven, which of course impacted by economic activity, gas prices, weather at the particular time of day. So if you have ice at 4 p.m., it's different than if you have ice at 2 a.m. We do know from our Drivewise customers that the number of miles has declined, number of miles driven over the last couple of years, really starting in the fourth quarter 2016. But how that will be in the future, it's hard to tell. So \u2013 and then you have seasonality of course. So seasonality, the frequency's typically higher, a lot higher in second half of the year than the first half, which if people want to talk about our guidance, we factor that in that we do think frequency is typically up first \u2013 the second half versus the first half of a given year.","So it's \u2013 but one point I tend to think about, it's almost like if I use it \u2013 it's baseball season so I use a baseball analogy. You have a pitcher, and you have a hitter. As a coach, you kind of know in general what the pitcher's good at, whether they get a fastball or curveball or something like that. But you don't know how good they're going be that day, nor do you know what every individual pitch is going to be. So to win, you just need the best hitter, someone who can pick up the pitch early, as soon as it releases from the person's hand, and react before it hits the plate.","In auto insurance, Allstate's a good hitter, right? In 2015, the frequency went up. We picked it up early. We made choice. We saw the same pitch in 2016 and we continued to see it. Others didn't see it. They then caught up. Frequency is down in 2017 and 2018, so as a hitter, our reaction is not to slack up and lower our prices. It's to just get a bit more margin. So what we do is we have a system that picks it up by state, by risk class, and that's really, I think, the best way to try to get a sense for how do you invest based on frequency, is think about the process, the people, the technology and can they hit.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'm going to switch gears quickly to homeowners. And I'm probably splitting hairs here, but if I look at the trailing 12 month underlying loss ratio in auto \u2013 sorry, in Allstate Brand home, it's up a couple points over the last couple of years. Just curious, if that's \u2013 at the current levels of profitability, are you happy with those levels or is there something that you're monitoring and might take more action to improve the underlying?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, you're living our life, which is we live our life splitting hairs. So I'll let Glenn take that one.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Right. I would like to start with sort of a longer term view. Because the second quarter marks the 24th consecutive quarter under 100 combined ratio in home. And in a volatile line of business, like homeowners, to have six years running of quarterly profit is remarkable. So we do take a long view on it. Just like in auto, we're looking state-by-state at our rates. We look at loss results. But if you look over the last five years, even at the underlying, we always say we want to be in the low-60s. And we were at the upper end the last couple of quarters of low-60s, at 63 and change. But if you look at two, three, four years ago, we're similar to those timeframes. And a lot of that is driven by weather. So we talk a lot about catastrophes but the non-cat weather, it drives our peril mix, which drives severity. It's just so much more volatility in the homeowners line than you see in auto between the frequencies and severities driven by weather patterns. So the long-term view, we feel very good about. We're monitoring from a rate standpoint and I would not say there are alarm bells based on the hair splitting or anything you brought there.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So why don't you talk a little bit about what you did see in peril mix and stuff in the second quarter?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, so definitely \u2013 whereas in the first quarter, we talked a lot about water and fire; continued with the water, definitely wind driving some of the peril mix moving with even intra-quarter decline on the fire \u2013 some fire in the quarter, but moving throughout the quarter downward.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So fire, fire loss is a lot higher. Like when fire gets in, your severity is a lot more higher than if somebody runs in your garage door. And so we had elevated fire losses in the second quarter and the same as wind and hail. So that bumped it up. That said, we watch it, right? And we have processes built in by a state to make sure we think we need to increase price because either frequency or severity, we do that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Campbell with KBW. Your line is now open.","Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yes, hi, good morning. .","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Good morning, Christopher. We can't hear the question. Maybe you can repeat it.","Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yes. Can you hear me now?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yes.","Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. I guess the first question is just on capital management. So Allstate's been a strong repurchaser of shares and bought a bunch back this quarter. Now is there a certain hurdle above which that you're thinking of where repurchases wouldn't be economical? And then how was your capital deployment strategy change if the shares got too expensive?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I'll let Mario talk about the overall capital plan, but I would say that a business that's growing with a 17% ROE with its current multiples, we think it's cheap.","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Yes, I would agree. Hi, Chris, this is Mario. So I guess where I'd start is when we look at our capital position, it continues to be excellent and we view it as a source of both strength and flexibility for us. And when I say that, I mean, the absolute level of capital we have, our capital structure and our capacity to source capital efficiently if we need to. When you look at those things combined with \u2013 to Tom's point, fact that the business is performing really well. We expect to continue to generate meaningful amounts of capital going forward. So we're long capital and we feel really good about our capital position. In terms of the buyback program, we still have $376 million left on the existing authorization and we'll continue to buy back stock. And when we run out, we'll follow the same process we always have. We'll talk to our board. We'll look at different alternatives and we'll make a call from that point.","Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just kind of one other question on SquareTrade. What's driving the year-over-year loss ratio improvement?","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","It's actually a variety of things. I mean, first, as they build up their scale, they're getting more effective. And so a combination of things like their claims handling, their ability to reduce escalations and so forth are all leading to better experience for the customer and lower loss costs for them.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I wanted to thank you hitters for taking my question. The homeowners growth and auto growth seems to be going in line with each other. I assume that that's mostly bundled sales. I'm interested in knowing how the homeowners only product is selling and what the marketplace looks like for growing in homeowners only.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, you're correct, Josh, in that you remember when auto was going down, the homeowners business got slightly smaller as well. But it lagged it, right? Because it's an annual policy, not everybody has it. So to the extent we were losing auto customers because we were raising prices, that impacted it and you see the other side of that. Glenn can talk about how we bundle, what we see in homeowners market.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, so we think it's great opportunity to bundle. And so we've aligned our incentives for agents around bundling. And we think it's the right thing for customers. What we're seeing in this cycle right now is that, as Tom said, it tends to lag the home \u2013 lags the auto in terms of whether it's going up or coming down. It seems to be pulling in a little more. And as you said, moving in tandem. So we're growing at pretty close to equivalent rates in real-time. So that is a result of more bundling of the product. We think we are very competitive in home right now. We have a lot of markets where we have a strong competitive position from a pricing standpoint. Our product is part of the reason for that. We have with house and home, a favorable product and our roof rating schedule allows us to do that. I think good catastrophe management and spread of risk over a long period of time has positioned us well for that. So we're in a really good spot to grow home.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I realize that having a home product increases the persistency of selling in auto, too. But is a home-only product terribly less persistent than an auto-home bundle? And ultimately, is it a long-term value of a home-only customer high and worth pursuing?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Josh, let me take that. Before we do that, I'll let Steve talk about homeowners and Esurance. And then I'll come back to your question on the lifetime value of a customer, either by policy or in total.","Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.","So yeah, as you know, in Esurance, we also have a homeowners product we rolled out over the last three or four years. We have it in 31 states I believe. And our PIF overall increasing Esurance is 4.1%, while it's 27% quarter-over-quarter from prior year in homeowners. So that's a really important sale for them because we spend money on marketing and advertising. And as we can get more premiums, so both auto and home, the cross-selling that we have \u2013 significantly makes the acquisition cost for us in terms of the customer acquisition. We're growing that for a handful of years now. We feel good with where we are. Obviously, you see we still have a really good geographic spread in the country. So we do have catastrophe quarters where we have some pretty good catastrophe. This is one of them. But we think we're doing well, growing well there. And it'll be a profitable addition to Esurance business.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So \u2013 and on the \u2013 does it \u2013 what does it do for (46:37) couple of key themes there. We want to make sure we make money on every product we sell so we don't lose money on one product and make it on another. So we have standards around how we underwrite and price our products so we make money on every \u2013 in each product. That said, you do know that \u2013 we know actually and you're obviously aware of as well \u2013 that the more things people buy from you, the longer they stay as a group. Now some of that's just they buy more from you because they like you more. And they like you more so they stay more. So there's a little bit of you got to be careful onto what you read into it. That said, the more opportunities you have to build connections to customers where they have ongoing relationships with you, all things being equal, they should stay longer and it's good for you. You lower your acquisition cost per customer, you improve their customer value proposition. You don't have to shop around to a whole bunch of people, which is why particularly in the lower left, we have such a broad-based set of products and services.","So whether that's auto insurance, home insurance, boat insurance, personal policies, life insurance, we sell them everything we can and we have metrics and measures around trying to do that, because we know it best meets their needs. And if we do that, they're more likely to stay. As Steve talked about, we're starting to expand that in the Esurance business as well, which particularly because of the high upfront acquisition costs, it helps you lower your acquisition costs dramatically and gives you a competitive advantage versus those people who only sell one thing. Sometimes they like \u2013 sometimes we end up only talking about auto insurance, and it's a big product for us. We need to compete aggressively in it, but we also want to win on a broad basis with our customers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Michael W. Phillips - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Tom, let's just take a step back and I ask kind of I think it might be a bit of a goofy question, but I'm going to throw it out there, hear your thoughts. As you look at the agency playing field and the folks that run all your exclusive agencies, I guess how is the average age changed over time? Has it shifted any? And then, has it gotten any more difficult to find replacements or recruits to replace what may be an aging population out there over the past, say, three to five years?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, let me \u2013 I'll answer your question specifically. And then I think where you're headed a little bit, Mike, is what is the long-term view of the agency platform? And so, particularly you look at some of the independent agency industry metrics, it's, as you know, they're all getting older, they're staying in the business, but they may not be there forever and who's going to take them over, so will that go away? We don't have that problem in the Allstate agency channel. We're out recruiting people all the time, whether that be our agency owners or licensed sales professionals. And so, we don't have a, what I'll call a demographic barrier to our future growth, or even maintaining our current position. That said, I think the business is going to change dramatically and that technology is going to enable us to have those people in the field who know our customers do a much better effective job for them by doing less data collection.","So if you go back to Glenn's view on integrated digital enterprise and the work effort that went into claims and how much was spent driving around, if you said instead of driving around you slipped in their data collection, then how much time is spent by agency systems in data collection. We're hard at work to trying to make that a much smaller piece of what they do. So maybe it's data verification and even then you don't have to do a tremendous amount of it. Change our products and processes and our technology to do that, used our technology to make the experience even better and then enhance by a person.","So I do think there's going be a lot of change driven in that channel. And we're pushing hard on doing it. So we're not just sort of saying, \"Oh, jeez, can we still hire the same amount of people?\" Our challenge will be to transition that system effectively and efficiently on behalf of our customers. And we're hard at work at that. As we've talked about, Matt talked about, and Glenn's picked up the trusted advisor work. We have a whole another series of work related to technology and product that we've embarked on that we think will further accelerate that.","Michael W. Phillips - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much for that detailed answer. Quick numbers question, if I could. The $135 million of development, I feel it's bodily injury liability and I'm assuming that's recent accident year 2017, maybe 2016. I guess if you could just confirm that. And then I noticed you took out the severity numbers of your press release unless I missed that (51:52)? Is that true for BI liability?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Right. There's two parts there. I'll let Mario handle the reserve changes, the net. He'll talk \u2013 and you're correct, it is bodily injury, but it wouldn't be the most recent years you're talking about. But, Mario can give you an update there. And then John can talk about what we've done on severity, because, as we talk about last time, we want to be fully transparent with everybody. But transparency also includes giving you information that means something. And so we changed the bodily severity stuff. So, Mario, do you want to start with reserves, and then John?","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, sure. So, I guess the place I'd start on the \u2013 kind of from a broad perspective on reserves, as we've mentioned in the past, we have really solid processes in place to both established reserves and continually reassess the level of reserves that we have really across the entire business. And when we look at our roughly $26.6 billion gross reserve balance, we feel really good that it's set at the appropriate level.","Having said that, as circumstances change, both in terms of our claim processes and the external environment, we look at that reserve balance every quarter and like we've done over the last number of quarters, to the extent there are releases, then we recognize those in the income statement. I think that's as much a function as our conservative approach to reserving as anything else. But I certainly wouldn't use that as a predictor of reserve releases going forward. It's just something we continue to look at and if reserves are redundant, we release them.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, so when you look back at \u2013 it wouldn't have been the 2016 and 2017 report years on bodily injury, it was before that. So you would look back \u2013 if you were to adjust the calendar year, combined ratio numbers we gave you, which you'll be able to do when you get the information. You can see it was really prior years to them.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Hey, Mike, it's John. Just specific to your question on the BI severity disclosures. We're very transparent overall in our financial reporting. We're clearly trying to aim to provide you with the best metrics to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Last quarter, we did signal that we were going to be removing the BI paid severity statistic. Really on a long tail coverage like BI, using a calendar year paid severity measure, it's much more an operational statistic than something that gives you a clear line of sight to the P&L. We do factor in overall severity trends in our guidance each year. So it's included in our underlying combined ratio guidance. And this quarter, you can find some color in 10-Q in terms of what our overall severity trends look like.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is now open.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning. I'll give you a chance to throw cold water on my enthusiasm, Tom. Your service business broke into the black, I think, for the first quarter and your life earnings were up a decent bit sequentially and I think year-over-year excluding partnerships. Is it onward and upward for both units or were there some one-time items helping out?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Bob, as you know, first, cold water would be a bad idea, right? But guidance would be equally a bad idea when it comes down to individual components of the P&L. So I won't give you specifics. I would just say on both of them, we feel really good about our life insurance business. It's earning good returns. It's well run. We're bringing our costs down. We just launched a new term product which we think will really work well with our customer base. We tend to want something simpler, so this is a monthly term. It just pays you by the month what you want for your family for three years, five years as opposed to some big number which scares people, some of our customer base. And so we feel good about where that business is positioned both operationally and strategically.","And we feel the same about the Service Businesses. There are some \u2013 of different characters, though, it's broadening our portfolio down to get some that are doing really well and others that we'd like to do better, and because we have high aspirations. So you'll see this quarter, the Allstate Dealer Services which has got almost 4 million policies out there. Its profit turned up. It used to make a lot more than it made this quarter. So we'd like to see it make more. But it made more than it did last quarter \u2013 its losses I think actually last year. So it's a \u2013 overall, though, we feel good about all those businesses.","One business you didn't mention which is our Annuity business, where their results are down this quarter because the performance-based investments, the returns were down. That said, even though performance-based investments were down, the yield on an annualized basis was still 9%. So we're feeling good about that. John can talk about it if you have an interest. But we feel good about where it is in total. Overall, that Annuity business continues to earn well returns on capital because you have to put so much cap up. We've talked about that in the past. We're trying to come up with ways to put up less capital so we can raise the return as well as by investing differently.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","That's helpful. And just a serious question, opening question, closing the loop. One of your large competitors yesterday on the issue of declining frequency observed that the industry is \u2013 because of the volatility of frequency, competitors tend not to factor in down frequency in future pricing actions. I was just wondering, you lowered your guidance for the range because of lower frequency. Are you factoring in negative frequency? I suspect not, into your thought process for prospective pricing actions.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, everybody prices differently, Bob. So I don't \u2013 it's hard to tell what people do. What I would tell you is that we look at total loss costs, which includes everything from underwriting expenses to loss costs which of course are a combination of frequency and severity. If you were to look at a graph of percentage change year-over-year of frequency and severity, you would see that they have \u2013 it's what we'll call the alligator chop because it's gotten wide. And so, severity's continued to go up at sort of an inflationary level. And that 4% plus depending which numbers you're looking at whereas frequency has gone down.","Pricing on that kind of basis and assuming the lower frequency is there usually means you're going to get caught in the jaws. Because at some point, the frequency could come back and the severity's not going away. So we tend to look at it on a long-term basis. Everybody does it their own way now. If frequency is down and stays down, where we take less and fewer price increases in the future, sure, and you see that this year. It doesn't really \u2013 from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it still earns really high returns even at our old guidance, which we tried to let people know in first quarter. It earns really, really high returns at this level so we're comfortable with the way we position. And I can't really speak to what the other competitors or I'd listen to their call as well and other people think as well.","Yeah, let's take one more call \u2013 question. Can we do that?","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. So Bob asked the question I was looking for. So, Tom, just to kind of clarify things here. Your pricing decisions right now that you're looking at for auto insurance book, you're kind of pricing in line with what you think loss trend is going to look like here going forward? You're not purposely providing below loss trend because you're looking for some market share gains?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","No, our growth \u2013 and I want to make sure we underline this, our \u2013 more than two-thirds of our growth in policies in force came from retention. So we didn't really get into new business discount and all that kind of stuff and loss ratio on that. But we're very comfortable with our growth and our profitability at this point because of how and why we're getting our growth, whether that's the retention in which customers we're retaining, which states we're retaining them in, or where our new businesses come from, whether that be risk class, state-based stuff. So we're comfortable that, we're in good position. We're not attempting to lower profitability to grow. That's not our \u2013 that's not been our strategy.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So, thank you all. Let me close. I know it's past the hour. We had a strong first half. So, we look forward to catching up with you next quarter. We're going to stay focused on our operating priorities to make sure we balance both the long- and short-term initiatives, so we can create more value for our shareholders, for our customers, and all our other stakeholders. So, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Pat Macellaro. Please go ahead.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. To begin, Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and I will provide some color on our results for the quarter, and then we'll answer your questions. We realize there are other calls this morning so we've shortened our comments. [Operator Instructions].","Yesterday we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the slides we'll use this morning. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q for the third quarter, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website.","We're recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now I'll turn it over to Tom, for his thoughts on the quarter.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning, everybody. We appreciate your interest and investment in Allstate. I'm going to start by providing an overview of the third quarter results, in particular how they tie to our strategy and our 2014 operating priorities. Then Pat and Steve will go -- provide some more context around results, then our leadership team will be here to answer your questions.","So in the room with us are Matt Winter, who leads Allstate personal lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","So let's begin with Slide 2. If you -- put simply, Allstate had a really good quarter this time. We continue to proactively take action, which is to enhance our competitive position, execute our strategy and deliver our current results. And while not everything is where it ultimately needs to be, most of the trends are in line with expectations. The strategy of focusing on unique value propositions for different customer segments is working. Growth increased, as we added almost 800,000 Property-Liability policies in force and increased annual net written premiums by $1.4 billion over the trailing 12 months.","Financial results for the quarter were also excellent. Net income was $750 million for the third quarter. As you can see, that's in the table on the bottom, which is significantly higher than last year's third quarter. But you remember last year, we reported the initial loss estimate on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2013 results.","Operating income for the third quarter was $1.39 per share.","The Property-Liability business generated good combined ratios in aggregate, despite catastrophe losses and investments in growth. Allstate Financial had good growth in the voluntary workplace benefits business with policies increasing almost 8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate Financial returns were up, which reflects higher investment yields, lower expenses and a declining capital base.","We also made progress on our 5 2014 operating priorities and delivered strong cash returns to our shareholders.","If you go to Slide 3, that breaks out the Property-Liability operating results for the 4 customer segments. Starting at top of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force increased 2.4% and net written premiums were 4.9% higher than the prior year quarter. Overall, profitability was strong with the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 93.5, which included 7.1 points of Cat losses. The underlying combined ratio for the third quarter was 86.1, which brings that year-to-date total then for the first 9 months to 86.4, which is better than the full year outlook range of 87 to 89 that we provided in February.","The Property-Liability results by customer segment are shown on the bottom half of the page. If you start with the largest segment, served by the Allstate agencies, that's in the lower left, profitability was good across all products and Matt's team continues to execute a comprehensive profitable growth plan. We continue to have broad-based auto policy growth, which is 2.6% higher than the prior year. There was also a modest increase of about 0.1% in homeowners, and other personalized policies were 1.7% higher than the prior year.","Esurance, which is in the lower right, had policy growth of 14% over the prior year quarter, which is a decline from last year's growth rate, reflecting the profit improvement initiatives. Growth investments continue to have a negative impact on the recorded combined ratio. And as we discussed in prior quarters, Don's team is focused on reducing the underlying loss ratio, which at 75.3 was about 2 points better than the prior year.","The lifetime profitability of growth at this loss ratio is above our cost of capital, so we remain committed to increasing market share in this segment.","Encompass, in the upper left, has slowed growth, particularly of its packaged [ph] policy offering as they expand profit improvement initiatives. Encompass' path to growth under Kathy will be first to improve profitability.","Answer Financial, in the upper right, sold nonproprietary policies through the web and call centers. Nonproprietary premiums increased almost 10% over the prior year quarter.","So if we go to Slide 4, our 5 2014 operating priorities are shown there. And since we just discussed both growth and profit, I'll focus on the remaining priorities. We experienced another good quarter of investment returns. The total portfolio return in the quarter was 0.4%, but it's 4.7% for the first 9 months of 2014, reflecting the proactive approach taken by Judy's team. Net investment income, however, was lower than the prior year quarter, as strong limited partnership income was not enough to offset the impact of the $12 billion reduction in the portfolio because of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","Modernizing the operating model will improve the customer value proposition by enhancing customer service and lowering cost. This includes simplifying technology applications and using continuous improvement to improve effectiveness and efficiency.","We also are looking to build long-term growth platforms. So to increase growth in our largest customer segment, we're building on the existing comprehensive growth plans by helping Allstate agents become trusted advisers and expanding into more local markets. Our broad product line, household focus and innovation by Good Hands Roadside and Drivewise further enhance those customer relationships.","The Drivewise telematics offering, we've expanded that to include a mobile phone application, which is now in 16 states, so we can compare the utilization of that method to the devices that are tied to the car's OBD ports.","Esurance's advertising messages of insurance for the modern world and 7.5 minutes, not 15 minutes, has further strengthened the brand for self-serve customers. Our broader product line, geographical expansion and more sophisticated pricing will also support market share gains.","So in summary, Allstate had strong results across a number of fronts in the quarter. The strategy to better meet the unique needs of customers and proactively manage both investments and capital continues to serve our shareholders well. So let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the Property-Liability highlights on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.3 billion in the third quarter, was 4.8% higher than the third quarter of 2013. Recorded combined ratio of 93.5 increased 3.5 points versus the third quarter of 2013 driven by increased catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 86.1 for the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date result to 86.4.","Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 11.3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by limited partnership income. Property-Liability operating income in the third quarter was $553 million, 19.3% lower than the third quarter of 2013, which, as you may recall, was a very benign quarter in terms of weather.","During the third quarter, the annual review of discontinued lines and coverage reserve levels led to an increase of $102 million in reserves, most of which pertain to asbestos liabilities. This increased the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio by 1.4 points for the third quarter. Reserves were increased by $133 million in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of last year's annual review.","The chart on the lower left shows net written premium and policy-in-force growth rates for Allstate Protection. The red line shows the continued positive policy growth trend that began in the second quarter of 2013. Policies in force have grown by 2.4% from last year's third quarter and 1.8% from year-end 2013.","The exhibit to the right of this chart highlights the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends, as well as results by brand. Esurance's underlying loss ratio of 75.3 for the third quarter of 2014 is also shown to isolate the impact of ongoing profit-improvement actions from the impact of growth investments.","Moving to Page 6, we show the components of premium and policy growth by brand. Focusing on the Allstate brand in the upper left chart, policies increased by 572,000 in the third quarter, which is 1.9% higher than the third quarter of 2013, driven by both favorable new business and retention trends. The Allstate brand grew net written premium by 4.5% in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter as average premiums continued to increase.","Total growth in net written premium was driven by a 4.9% increase in the Allstate brand auto and a 2.9% increase in Allstate brand homeowners compared with third quarter of 2013.","Moving to the chart on the right-hand side, you can see the policy-in-force growth trends for Allstate brand auto and homeowners going back to 2005. Current results compare favorably to recent history due to having substantially completed the repositioning of the homeowners business. In this quarter, Allstate brand auto policies rose by 504,000 or 2.6% from the prior year quarter. Allstate brand homeowners rose by a modest 5,000 policies from the prior year quarter, which is indicative of continued progress in leveraging this product as a competitive advantage versus monoline auto carriers.","Allstate brand auto -- Allstate brand policy growth is geographically broad-based and reflects both better customer retention and new business sales. There are currently 42 states growing Allstate brand auto policies and 21 states growing Allstate brand homeowner policies versus the prior year.","Esurance's read of premium and policy growth in the lower left continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure a long-term profitable growth as well as Esurance's increasing size. Total Esurance premium grew by 14%, policies in force grew by 14.1% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2013. Spending on expansion contributed approximately 2 points to the combined ratio in the third quarter.","Encompass policy-in-force growth, highlighted in the lower right, also continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to ensure acceptable long-term returns. Net written premium growth of 4.3% in the third quarter compared with third quarter of 2013 includes the impact of higher average premiums that are the result of the profit improvement plan.","Slide 7 highlights Allstate brand auto and homeowner underlying margin trends. The charts on the left show Allstate brand auto and home recorded and underlying combined ratio trends, while the charts on the right show the components of the quarterly underwriting combined ratio.","As you can see on the charts on the left-hand side, while there's volatility in the recorded combined ratio trends from quarter-to-quarter due to catastrophes, the long-term underlying combined ratio results have been both very good and stable for auto insurance and steadily improving for homeowners.","The Allstate brand auto under its [ph] current premium continued to increase in the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior year quarter.","Premium increases have been improved in 35 states so far in 2014, reflecting an organizational focus on maintaining margins by making frequent adjustments based on actual results. The underlying losses and expenses per policy increased slightly in the third quarter by 1\/10 of 1% compared with the third quarter of 2013. This resulted from a lower frequency of claims and expected increase in severity of losses, along with the benefit from the lower expense ratio.","We experienced similar results in the third quarter for Allstate brand homeowners. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy reflect prior year quarter and average earned premium continued to increase, although at a slowing rate, as more states approach rate adequacy. Allstate brand homeowners underlying combined ratio was 60 in the third quarter.","We're continuing to take rate increases and make underwriting and product changes as needed to continue to keep pace with loss trends and maintain the underlying combined ratio in both of these lines.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve, to cover Allstate financial, investments and capital management.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 8, our strategy is for Allstate Financial to become more strategically integrated with the Allstate brand's customer value proposition.","Allstate Life and Retirement has been refocused on the Allstate agencies, but the integration in the Allstate brand customer value proposition will require a multi-year effort. The chart on the bottom of this page highlights operating income by quarter, including and excluding the impact of the sold Lincoln Benefit Life business.","Operating income for the quarter was $125 million, 1.6% lower than the third quarter of 2013, but higher when excluding LBL results from the prior year. Operating income return on equity has continued to improve given our efforts to focus the business; a lower cost structure; strong investment income over the past 4 quarters, reflecting limited partnership income; and the $1.2 billion return of capital by the Allstate Life Insurance Company over the past 12 months. So that estimated historical results with Lincoln Benefit Life are provided on our third quarter 2014 10-Q and the investor supplement to provide you with further context.","On Slide 9, in the top left graph, you can see the composition of the investment portfolio and the impact of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which reduced the size of the portfolio by $12 billion. We are taking a measured approach over time to shift the portfolio composition from fixed income assets to equity and other assets, where returns are driven primarily by idiosyncratic performance.","Our equity and owned portfolio is lower compared to the prior year end primarily due to the reclassification of tax credit investments to other assets and the sale of approximately $300 million of limited partnership positions.","Our total portfolio return, presented at the top right, was 0.4% for the third quarter as investment income of 1% was partially offset by lower fixed income and equity valuations. You can see the valuation impact varies from quarter-to-quarter, while the income yield has remained relatively constant.","Total return for the first 9 months of 2014 was 4.7%. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income and yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which comprise approximately half of the portfolio. This approximate equal split reflects the strategic decision to deploy capital out of Allstate Financial.","The Property-Liability portfolio in the lower left graph shows the interest-bearing yield has stabilized after our 2013 rate risk reduction actions and illustrates the variability in income that may result from limited partnership and other equity investments. The Allstate Financial portfolio, in the lower right graph, has a more stable yield due to the longer duration of these investments and the limited reinvestment activity. The decline in quarterly income versus the prior year is due to the sale of LBL.","Allstate Financial's portfolio has been reduced through a variety of actions that resulted in a decline of total invested assets from a peak of $78 billion in the first quarter of 2007 to $39 billion in the third quarter of 2014.","Slide 10 provides an overview of how our capital structure has changed over time. On the left-hand side of the page, you can see the capital structure at the end of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2014, and the shift from predominantly senior debt to include more hybrid debt and preferred stock, increasing both our strategic and financial flexibility.","With the repayment of $650 million of senior debt in August, the capital restructuring plan we started early last year is complete. That said, we constantly evaluate alternative sources of capital to lower our cost or decrease volatility in order to create additional shareholder value.","Shareholders received cash returns of over $1 billion in the third quarter, as we repurchased $926 million of common stock and paid $122 million in common stock dividends. Through the first 9 months of the year, total common shareholder cash returns were $2.42 billion, including quarterly dividends, the completion of one $750 million accelerated share repurchase program, the initiation of a second $750 million accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. We have now completed just over 75% of the $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization approved in February in about 40% of the authorized 18-month repurchase period.","Book value per common share reached $48.28, increasing 6.6% since year end and 11% since September 30 of last year. Operating income return on equity was a strong 13% in the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, but lower than the full year 2013 return of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses in the first 9 months of this year and a higher equity base. As I mentioned last quarter, much of the increased equity is a result of the positive impact of the 2013 change to pension and retiree benefits and plan assumption changes.","Now let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question, can you -- Tom, could you talk a little bit about the other personal lines business? That roughly $2.5 billion of premium. What were the trends in that line up from a profitability perspective?","Thomas J. Wilson","Sure, let me provide some overall context and then Matt can give you some specifics by line. But first, as you know, in that customer segment, where they want local advice and branded products, that is -- that's served by the Allstate Agency. They want to buy most of their stuff from the same person. The logic is that I don't want to have to have a relationship with somebody to buy auto insurance and home and boat and PUP policies and renters policies. So we try to -- we do offer them a broad range of stuff. And we have -- Matt's team has been working on more of a household focus, which includes those policies. So we've, of course, sold those for years. I think we have about 5 million policies in total in force, when you look at them in total. Matt can take you through sort of both the growth trends, where we've had some good success, and profitability.","Matthew E. Winter","Thanks, Tom. Thanks, first of all, for asking about the other personal lines. We often get through call without ever mentioning these. And as Tom mentioned, we're trying to incorporate all the products a customer might need within the Allstate Agency value proposition. And so we've had an increased emphasis on the other personal lines products. As you know, there's a wide group of products grouped within this category, and we do, do the breakdown on the -- in the investor sup on both Pages 15 and 30 that gives you some of the net written premium trends and the policy-in-force trends. What you see on the profit side is we've had a fair amount of margin actions this year in the landlord, manufactured home and the PUP areas. And so that has suppressed some of our IIF growth, because of those margin actions in those lines. Most of our item-in-force growth has come from renters and condo, which are where we need them to be from a profitability standpoint. We did have some decline in involuntary auto, as more companies are willing to take on more of those drivers. That somewhat dampened our growth. But overall, when we look at our other personal lines products, other than the work that we have ongoing in landlord, manufactured home and PUP, we feel very good about the profitability, very good about the growth prospects in all those individual product areas.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And could you provide sort of an underlying or just an indication of kind of where that business is running maybe relative to auto and home?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, you can see that on Slide 3, Mike. The combined -- the recorded combined ratio for other personal lines for this quarter was 85, that compares to 81 for home and 93 for auto. And as Matt pointed out, there's a wide range of products, so the capital under those products varies significantly. [indiscernible] returns.","Matthew E. Winter","You might also look, Mike, Page 23 of the investor sup, shows the loss ratio, cat ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio for that category.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, great. And then just in terms of the homeowners lines, so now that's ticking on the plus side for the first time in a while, and the new issued apps [ph] seem to be moving in the right direction. Can you kind of talk about what you expect there? I mean, do you still see opportunities now for PIF growth to move further into positive territory? And what are the factors driving that? And how should we think about the interaction between that and auto if you look to get more on the offensive there?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll provide a longer term perspective and Matt can talk about -- well, his current growth plans and the profit improvement plans because while we're happy with the overall combined ratio where it is today, this is -- it's a country with 50 states and -- and a couple of territories, and so we have to do things differently in each of those and so they're not all perfect. But if you -- there is -- we put in a slightly longer view. If you really look at homeowners in total, I think, it peaked, Mike, about 7.8 million policies and it's a little above 6 million now. And it's really been coming down since the '06 period of time, where we started taking pretty drastic action in, at the time, relatively narrowly focused cat areas, being Florida and Louisiana, a few places. Then as the weather got worse in '08 and '09, we expanded that activity by both increasing prices and, as importantly, our re-underwriting the book and making sure we like the individual properties we had taken risk on. And you can see, the business kept coming down on an overall items-in-force level. That does -- auto does track with it. If you look at our -- the growth rate of those 2, they track together. That said, we weren't willing in the depths of the -- getting smaller in the homeowners business to give ourselves a complete out for that because there are, of course, monoline auto companies that grow and we felt that we should be able to grow as well. It's a little harder though when you're telling somebody, \"I'm not going to insure your house. Please keep your auto with me, then please give me your auto if you don't have it.\" So they do trend together, but they are also separate. And so auto has had higher growth rates over the last couple of years than home has. Home has finally ticked positive. It's 5,000 on 6 million. That doesn't count as sustainable growth. So Matt can talk about what they're doing to get sustainable growth out of that business and how it turns into a competitive advantage for us relative to both the local advice and branded Allstate segment, and -- but we won't go there right now. But you also know we're adding this to the Esurance platform as well so that they can be in that segment.","Matthew E. Winter","Thanks, Tom, and Mike, thanks for the question. As you noted, this is the first quarter since 2006 that we grew items on a year-over-year basis. And while it's by a small number of policies, it's pretty widespread, widespread geographically and widespread in terms of its drivers, being both favorable new business and retention. As Pat noted in his opening remarks, we now have 21 states that are growing year-over-year. New business is 12% above prior year, and we actually have 36 states with higher new business levels than last year. As we've talked about on previous calls, we've been putting in House & Home. House & Home growth has been higher than our countrywide average. And as we've also discussed, House & Home gives us some benefits on the profitability side in that it normally goes in rate adequate when we launch it. And due to its product design, tends to be more stable and tends to require less rate. And so it gives us a competitive advantage in terms of stability in the marketplace. On the retention side, retention in homeowners continues to improve. We're now up 1.2 percentage points since 2012, and we have 38 states that are above prior year retention levels. What's interesting to us is that while we monitor both first and subsequent retention, and both are showing favorable trends, we've noticed that subsequent retention has now reached its highest level since 2005. So we feel quite good about the new business growth. We feel quite good about the retention trends and we feel quite good about the profitability of that business to enable us to maintain that trend line. So we believe we have more room to go. We did have some benefit of opening up in some PML areas that had previously been closed, where we figured diversification benefit was worth allowing small policy growth there. But by no means do we feel like we've capped out. We think we have geographic areas within the United States that are under-penetrated compared to what our market potential is. And we think we have room to grow as we expand our agency footprint in some of those areas. So we're cautiously optimistic about the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Question on Allstate Financial. Where is the expense structure relative to where you want to be without LBL? You mentioned expenses, I think, is bullet 4 or 5, as a priority, but what sort of timing should we expect on getting the expenses rightsized to the smaller operation?","Don Civgin","Bob, it's Don. Thanks for the question, and thanks for noticing that the expenses are down. Sometimes, it's thankless work, but I appreciate you pointing it out. The Allstate Financial strategy, which we've been consistently following for the last 4 or 5 years, really results in a business that's smaller and far better aligned with the Allstate customer value proposition. Part of that -- and Steve mentioned how much smaller the investment assets are. A lot of that happened actually over the course of the last 4 years or so, even though we pointed out a 7-year timeframe. And so that has put a lot of pressure on the expense structure. We're down this year about 22% in Life and Retirement business. I'll exclude Allstate Benefits, because they're growing. But in the Allstate Life and Retirement business we're down about 22% in expenses from last year's quarter. I expect those numbers to continue coming down some. But we're getting to the point where we're about the right size -- or the expense structure is about the right size for the company. What we really want to do now is make sure that we're focused on supporting the customer, the Allstate customer, through the Allstate agencies and generating some growth for the company. I think that's going to take a bit longer to get through the transition with Lincoln Benefit Life. But the expense piece of it has come down nicely, and we still have a little bit more to go.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And the follow-up is on auto. With gas sub $3 in a lot of areas, are you pricing for increased frequency yet? Or you're waiting to see what will happen?","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay, Bob, Bob, I love the follow-up from the life to auto. But I love you anyway. Matt can talk specifically about all these, of course. Frequency has all kinds of components in it, right? It's got miles driven, it's got who drives the car, it's got -- that's affected by a lot things including gas prices. The biggest driver historically, from our analysis, which is kind of hard to get between that, is really on the economic growth. So people are working, unemployment rates are down, economic activity is up, people are going to restaurants, they're driving places. And so as you look at the progress, and of course, unemployment and economic activity has trended up for the last 3 or 4 years. Matt's team has reflected that into the results, and you see we've been able to maintain ratios. Gas prices may have an impact on mileage driving. And we track it. It's not as close, right? Because gas prices aren't really that significant a cost that they keep people from driving. So if you're paying $4 a gallon and you suddenly pay $3 a gallon, even if you're getting 10 miles per gallon, you're saving $0.10 a mile. It's not really a barrier to people going places. That said, you tend to get more like summer driving vacations and stuff like that. I would just say Matt's team has proven their ability to micro-target that stuff and drive it in a way there. So Matt, if you want to make comment about frequency and profitability?","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Thanks, Tom. I don't really have much to add as far as the gas price impact. As Tom said, it's something we'll watch and watch carefully. But we don't expect it to be a core driver. That being said, our frequency so far has been extremely favorable to prior year. It's within our historical ranges, it's broad geographically. So our frequency trends are -- have been good. We stay on top of them, as Tom says. This is a national business managed very locally. And so even if the change in gas prices drives behavior and miles driven in some small geographies, it will be geographically specific. It won't be widespread. And so we'll manage it that way, and we'll continue to do what the company has been quite good at doing. As you see on page 7 of our presentation, we have a pretty long-term history of managing our margins well and keeping an eye on both frequency and severity and reacting accordingly. So it's something to watch, but not something to obsess over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first topic I want to cover is on reinsurance cost. Reinsurance costs appear to be coming down pretty dramatically over the course of this year and probably into next year. Could you update us on your reinsurance protection strategy in terms of whether you expect those savings to fall through to the bottom line? Or perhaps you've used a portion of those savings to buy more coverage?","Thomas J. Wilson","Steve, do you want to talk about the [indiscernible]. Jay, we redid those programs in June. It was just -- even if current -- if pricing is lower today than it was in June, we put our plan in place. It was a multi-year plan.","Steven E. Shebik","So Jay, this is Steve. As Tom said, we put in place a multi-year plan, the core reinsurance is a 3-year plan rolling 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3. And this year, well, actually last year and going into this year, we started issuing catastrophe bonds again, which we had not done for about 5 or 6 years. This year in particular, we issued over $1 billion and it was in excess, I think, of $2.75 billion if I remember it correctly. So the core part of the program is really subject to the changing pricing in the reinsurance market. But it would only be -- kick in about 1\/3 at a time each year going forward. And as you know, our pricing is adjusted for reinsurance costs, so that kind of bleeds into the pricing over a period of time. We did take the chance -- opportunity this year for the lower -- with the lower prices in the core reinsurance market to buy more coverage up top, so -- and also at the bottom. So for those several years, we've had a first event $750 million retention, we lowered that to $500 million this year, and we increased the amount of coverage on the topside of the program. So we have the best coverage, I believe, we've ever had. And we have multiple sources, both the traditional reinsurance program and the catastrophe bonds that are 4- and 5-year maturity type bonds. So we're covered over a longer period of time.","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, this is Tom, maybe to take it up a level in terms of capital management. We kind of look at reinsurance as just capital at this point. And so Steve talked about how we use it to reduce volatility. We, of course, are trying to be proactive everywhere in the capital structure. So we put a bunch -- as Steve pointed out, we took a bunch of debt out, put on preferred, put on hybrids, which lowers our cost of capital and puts us in a really strong financial position. As the market develops, I think what you're seeing in reinsurance pricing is really the growth of -- the increased interest in insurance-related investments and assets. And so we think you'll continue to see new forms of alternative capital being developed, which will enable us to either lower reinsurance costs, take advantage of other things in the capital structure or find other ways to lower our cost of capital or take volatility out of the business.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. On the capital management front, Tom or Steve, I find it interesting that Allstate appears to be moving towards share buybacks and dividends being in excess of annual operating earnings. There's only a few companies in the property-casualty sector that did that -- or have done that so far, mostly on the commercial line side, but Allstate doesn't have the pricing pressure they're facing. So can you update us a bit in terms of level of magnitude and in terms of what you're thinking on the pace of buybacks and dividends relative to earnings?","Thomas J. Wilson","We don't -- I know some of the banks, Jay, do it that way. They say 80% of their earnings. We don't do it that way. We obviously look at it relative to how much capital we have, which is dependent on earnings. But we look at how -- for example, some of the things, we got rid of -- we've reduced, as Steve pointed out, we've reduced the size of the Allstate Life and Retirement balance sheet by about $40 billion, which is equal to some life insurance companies. And so the capital that supported that, we either can deploy in growing our property casualty business or in giving it to shareholders. We -- included in that was the sale of Lincoln Benefit. So that's been factored in. We don't forecast where we'll go after we get done with this share repurchase program. But Steve's been very aggressive in buying back the current shares because we have plenty of capital, and we're feeling good about returns. And we do want to keep that capital and have our ROE go down.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a question starting with Allstate Financial. In the quarter, there was a fair amount of difference between the third quarter and the second quarter operating earnings. I was wondering if we're at a level that we can start to think of building off of the third quarter going forward.","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll give my view. Steve and Don may have their own views. I think this quarter looks more like the future than last quarter, John.","Yes, I think they're going to agree.","Don Civgin","No one is answering, so I think we all agree.","Thomas J. Wilson","We're not -- we don't do forecasts by line or by company or something like that. But you had some increased limited partnership returns last quarter, the second quarter of this year than this year. Now I will point out, I know there's been some questions from people about the volatility about limited partnership returns. And yes, it is true that limited partnership returns are more volatile. But that's specifically why we break them out for you, and it's also specifically why we do it. And so if you think about that, our investment philosophy is get a good risk adjusted for return, not to try and optimize any given quarter. And then we -- the return -- we look for attractive returns. And because these investments are volatile, they tend to get higher returns. And it also puts another -- with the idiosyncratic or the asset-specific concentration on investment results, it puts some diversification into the portfolio rather than just the market. So it's a good reason for that standpoint. And also if you look at our overall volatility, we've reduced volatility in the investment portfolio because of interest rates. You see that in lower operating income, but if you look at how we've shortened the duration in the Property-Liability portfolio, that's reduced volatility. While this injects a little more volatility, we think it's volatility that is higher return than just keeping interest rates -- our duration out there. So we thought the trade between the 2 and the risk return. And then if you look at the volatility across the company, and go up a level, while I know this makes it harder for you all to forecast what that -- the limited partnership returns will be, and then hence, what Allstate Financial's returns will be. If you look at the volatility in the overall company P&L, we have plenty of places. We've have plenty of volatility and this is just an uncorrelated piece of volatility. So we have catastrophe volatility, frequency volatility and then the partnership volatility. But we spike it out so you can get it, but we think overall, it's exactly the right thing to be doing with our investments, even though it creates a little bit of confusion as to, is your run rate 150 or 125.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. No, that all make sense. And you sort of got to my follow-up, which had to do with whether you're making any changes to the investment portfolio allocation towards these types of investments.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So this is Judy. And yes, we are changing our allocation towards these types of investments. As Tom just said, we like this trade off versus interest rates currently and, frankly, into the future. But we're doing that at a measured pace. There's no denying that the market is pretty fully priced in terms of valuations. So we're looking at the space, we like the space over the long term. It's just finding the right investments for us, and those idiosyncratic investments that we think will deliver higher returns again, over the long-term.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Judy, you're highly diversified in the space you're in right? So if...","Judith Pepple Greffin","Yes. Within the overall portfolio, we're highly diversified; and then this part of the portfolio, we're highly diversified as well. And you can see that in the Q, we break that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Two quick questions, the first question is on loss-cost trends. Can you talk about what you might be seeing in Personal Injury Protection, auto severity trends, concerning the fact that one of your competitors pointed out to a 17% increase recently?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, of course you know PIF coverage is in about 5 states. I'm not sure what their 17% was, if that was one state or across the country. It seems like a pretty -- it seemed high to me if it was across all 5 states. If it was us, we'd be really worried about that. I don't know if they are or not, and I don't know who you are talking about at this point, but I'll soon find out. Matt, do you want to talk -- it's really a relatively highly focused, but important question, because those states tend to be pretty large states, being New York, Florida, Michigan, anyway, Matthew?","Matthew E. Winter","So as Tom said, I'm not sure specifically who you're referring to. So I can't comment on what they might have said. Obviously, PIF and BI are things that we watch constantly. They tend to be somewhat volatile. And they move around and bounce around. And if they're not managed carefully, they can get out of control. We watch them carefully and we react in a variety of different ways, depending upon the geography. In some cases, it's pricing action, it's -- in other cases, it's underwriting actions. In other cases, it's managing where we're growing and where we're not. And so we'll continue to manage those 2 coverages fairly aggressively. We're not seeing anything get out of control from our perspective, I can say that. We're seeing normal volatility that we would expect. But we're not seeing anything out of control.","Thomas J. Wilson","I would -- a couple of things I would look at too if -- on the subject [ph] without trying to [indiscernible], but I'd first look at their size of the book, if they have a small book. I'd also look at what happened the prior year. That -- as Matt pointed out, that PIP line could be highly volatile. You get some pretty good cases in there, and all of a sudden, the quarter-over-quarter looks really wild, but the absolute level looks okay in the long term. So I don't know whether something has a problem or not. There's also the claim procedures and the schedules in which we operate. And sometimes you can't control that, which is -- so they'll put a schedule in to say chiropractors get a certain amount of money, and you have to pay according to that. So it doesn't mean that the company's not well managed, it just means you're doing what you're required to do. But the way in which you manage that is exactly what Matt said, which is you're keeping -- paying attention to it and either you're controlling your cost and making sure people get the right amount of money or you're changing your pricing. And as he pointed out, we were -- we have -- I think, when people look at our business on profitability, they tend to take a commercial lines perspective and look at sort of price and loss cost, and assume it's all about price. We really have a system. And you really have to think about the system, how it works at a granular level, which makes adjustments all the time. And it's that system that's generated the good combined ratios in auto insurance for a decade. And it's managing and leading that system which we have to do to make sure we get good returns.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","The only other question I had was going back to the discussion on telematics and I think you mentioned the mobile app is in 15 states. What I was wondering was, why not skip the OBD or the app step and work directly with car manufacturers? We all are talking about the connected car concept. Why -- what would preclude you from working out some sort of arrangement with, let's say, the big 3 car manufacturers and installing something on those vehicles which allows the customer to get a code from Allstate.","Thomas J. Wilson","It's a good question and the answer is nothing, but it wouldn't be comprehensive, in part because the average age of the fleet is 11 years. And so there's a whole bunch of people out there driving that we'd like to offer them the opportunity to get more sophisticated pricing and a better driving experience now as opposed to waiting until they buy a new car. So we're actively in conversations with everybody. And that range of potential participants in the connected car, obviously, includes the OEs, the auto manufacturers, but it also includes the telcos. Some of the telcos are interested, some of the other connected customer technology companies are interested. So we're active in all the fronts. We'd like to think of this as a tremendous opportunity for our company. And it will evolve, and so we're trying to put as many oars in the water as we can so that we at least stay with the tide, if not get ahead of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I thought I'd ask a big picture question about Esurance. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you guys are thinking about the economics of ad spend, really rough numbers. It kind of looks like you spent maybe $500 million, $600 million on advertising since you've bought the business. You've driven a similar amount of new business growth. And so I'm curious on how you think about or we should think about what the returns of that investment would be. And big pictures, is this something where you should be advertising more if you could scale up the organization and you can handle the level of growth?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll give you a strategic answer and Don can jump into the specifics, and we look at it both ways, Josh. So certainly, we think it is an important growth element in our plan. So we -- to a certain extent, if you go way up, what we've done is we now have a diversified set of growth opportunities with -- inside the Property-Liability space. We've traded some of that off for diversification and growth opportunities by reducing the size of our life business. So we used to have -- so we have -- and we had this opportunity with a highly focused customer value proposition to go at that self-serve space and really take on GEICO and Progressive Direct head on with, in our words, out self-serve them. And so that's why we talk about 7.5 minutes, not 15. We also are good at that. The reason that diversification by customer segment works is because it's something we're really good at, both pricing, settling claims, and all that has turned out to be true in aggregate for us. I think the business is up about not quite double yet, we're about 80% bigger than when we bought it. And you're right, we've invested a lot of money in it. We also think we've enhanced the underlying processes, not all of which you see in the current P&L, because we continue to invest aggressively in, like, rolling out homeowners, motorcycle, renters. I think that, Don, that's eaten up a couple of points of profit just last quarter. So we continue to invest in that. And we think it's an opportunity for us to compete more directly and stop them from coming to compete with the -- in the multiline customers in the lower left. And so we like the portfolio approach it gives us. So that said, we like the deal, we're glad we paid a lot of money for it. And we're even happier that it's turned out to be growing and we're going to make money on it. As it relates to the individual annual amount, that gets balanced a couple of ways. One is we look at our overall profitability of the company. And I like there to be a balance between that. So while we certainly could spend more money, I don't want to put too much pressure on other parts of the business that also have growth opportunities. We've got lots of places we can grow. Matt's adding agencies, Kathy's growing the benefits business. We've got plenty of places we can grow. So we try to balance it in the overall portfolio of growth opportunities. And then Don looks specifically at the returns and the efficiency curve, so to speak. So Don, you might want to talk about how you figure out where the efficiency curve is and then the economics by kind of segment.","Don Civgin","Yes, Josh, it's -- clearly as Tom said, the Esurance acquisition was done to give us a strategic advantage with that particular customer segment, not to make our GAAP results easier to explain. And it has grown -- 14% growth this last quarter, on top of 27% last year, it's been growing really nicely. But it forces us to balance between the growth and the profitability. The way we run the company, the objective function is to grow it as quickly as we can while maintaining the economics so that the returns are above our cost of capital. Now that requires balancing a few things. So if I look at this year's result so far, we've been working hard on the loss ratio. That came down a couple of points again this quarter. It's down a little bit more than that year-to-date. We feel really good about the loss ratio. The expenses year-to-date are lower if you take out advertising. And then as Tom mentioned, we've got a couple of points of investment in things like motorcycle, homeowners, renters, other product launches and so forth. And what we're really trying to do then is balance how much we spend on marketing with the acquisition cost that creates so that we can continue to manage our combined ratio on a lifetime basis to be something under 100. Should we -- if we wanted to strategically, we could relax some of those constraints. But as Tom said, we don't want to use more than our share of the resources of the company. And they're growing really nicely. I mean, the fact that they're up 80%, 85% since we bought them and still running on a sustainable economic basis is good. So that's the construct under which we're operating. We'll continue to balance that kind of quarter-by-quarter as it relates to marketing. But my suspicion is we'll continue to see improvements in loss ratio because it's been a focus area, which will allow us to spend a little bit more on acquisition and still make the equation work.","Patrick Macellaro","Jonathan, this is Pat, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just one question. Management's stated goal has been to maintain the margin, and yet you've gone past it and done extremely well for the last couple of quarters. Curious as to whether you intend to keep this margin or do you think that your overrunning just a tad and would like to maybe just grow some more?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, as you point out, we're operating at the bottom end of the range that we provided to everybody in February. We provided that range to give you all a sense for how good we think the underlying economics are of the business, and we'll do that again in February, of the outcome here [ph]. We put a range on it obviously because frequency and severity can bounce around a good point each without actually -- the underlying -- the actual economics being just volatile as opposed to you've done something right or wrong. So we like where we're operating today. As you could hear from Don's comments, we're all in for growth, but it's got to be profitable growth. Sometimes we get growth and it's not profitable and then we shrink it. Other times, we get growth and it's profitable, a little more profitable than we think. So we toggle between those at a relatively micro level. But we don't have any desire to reduce our returns in auto or homeowners or our other businesses today to get more growth. We don't think we need to, we think we're accurately priced. We think the combination of our pricing sophistication, claim skills, distribution, unique value propositions, marketing, all that adds up to customer value where they're prepared to let us earn the economic rents we do. So we're happy with where we're at. So we're not looking to sort of say combined ratio's going to go up so we can grow another point. That's not a good trade for shareholders.","Well, thank you all. I know you've got an incredible amount of work between -- in the next couple of days. So thank you for listening. Our strategy is working, it's profit growth, shareholder returns. We're proactive in running the business. We have a number of initiatives underway, which will enable us to continue to do those things.","So we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Pat Macellaro. Please go ahead.","Pat Macellaro","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for Allstate\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer Steve Shebik, and myself, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter, and posted the results presentation we\u2019ll use this morning along with an update to our 2016 countrywide reinsurance program to reflect the replacement of our Florida program. These documents are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement.","As many of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team as I transition to leading our Encompass team. I\u2019m leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of John Griek, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward. John and other members of our senior leadership team will be able to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Thomas.","Tom Wilson","Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up with Allstate. I\u2019ll provide an overview of results, and then you\u2019ll hear from Pat and Steve. We also have Matt Winter, our President, here with us; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, who is President of Allstate Life & Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","Let\u2019s begin on slide two. The second quarter results highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helps us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hail storm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents, and the impact of Brexit on the investment markets. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan.","Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a reported combined ratio of 100.8% and an underlying combined ratio of 88.6% for the quarter and 87.9% for the first six months, which is in comparison to our full-year forecast of 88% to 90%.","Allstate\u2019s financial strategic repositioning is working, with operating income up slightly to $120 million. Investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio.","Let\u2019s go to slide three, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our core property\/liability customer segments. As you know, we have a consumer-focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for property and liability protection. The results of each of the four segments of the property\/liability market are shown in the diagram on the bottom of the page.","Allstate\u2019s agencies provide local advice on a broad range of branded products. It represents about 90% of total property\/liability premiums. Total Allstate brand policies in force declined from the second quarter of last year by 1%, as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs on customer retention.","While auto policies declined, net written premium increased by 3.9%, which has essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The recorded combined ratio was 101.2%. The recorded combined ratio for homeowners was 97%, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5% for the Allstate branded business for the quarter.","Moving across to the lower right is that Esurance policies in force declined as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior-year quarter. The recorded and underlying combined ratios were 108.9% and 104.8%, which were 1.3 and 1.9 points better than last year\u2019s second quarter results. The underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior-year quarter.","In the upper right is Answer Financial. That\u2019s our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior years, which reflects fewer leads from Esurance as we reduced growth at Esurance.","Independent agencies serve customers who want local advice but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass in the upper left serves this segment and has taken significant actions that have reduced the size of the business while simultaneously improving returns.","Policies in force were down 11.4%. You can see that in the red box there at the top. Net written premiums declined by 6.8%, as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior-year quarter.","As you know, we establish and communicate our operating priorities each year, and they range from doing a better job for customers to driving long-term growth, which are shown on slide four. The first three priorities are all interrelated. We\u2019re of course always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response catastrophe that we\u2019ve become known for as well as our agency owners being trusted advisors in helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life\u2019s uncertainties.","We\u2019ve had over 215,000 catastrophe claims through the end of June and have closed approximately 95% of those. We\u2019re continually focused on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. Achieving target returns on capital, however, has required us to raise prices on auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim costs.","So we responded with a comprehensive profit improvement program, which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business volumes. It has also had a negative impact on customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 1.4% decline in the number of property\/liability policies in force. Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over last year, offsetting the property\/liability decline, but all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term.","As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile, from the early decline in energy prices to a rebound and then down again and Brexit. We have record low interest rates and global equity markets that have been moving up, down, and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution have served us well in this environment, with a total return of 3.9% for the first six months of the year.","We continue to build out our performance-based asset team and made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payout annuity block. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, this is economically the right risk and return tradeoff for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. We\u2019ve also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to roadside services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want to highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on slide five.","Allstate began investing in the telematics space over six years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways, and we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress over this time period. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables us to give customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we\u2019ve found ways to use a continuous connection to broadly evaluate [ph] gifts (8:58) from Allstate and provide additional services to them.","For example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We\u2019ve also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver Awards are very popular and expand that customer value proposition. We\u2019ve built up a wide range of capabilities and made significant investments, and today we have over 1 million connected customers.","We\u2019ve also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual report to the shareholders. As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company, which you can see on the graphic on the lower left of this slide. This provides us with the strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity\u2019s capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future, and this structure enables us to participate in that value creation.","Now let me turn it over to Pat.","Pat Macellaro","Thanks, Tom. I\u2019ll start by reviewing the property\/liability P&L at the top of slide six.","Property\/liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016 was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. Through the first six months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first six months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting income. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior-year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first six months of last year.","These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8% in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6% for first half of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio of 88.6% in the second quarter and 87.9% in the first six months of 2016 were both below their respective levels in 2015. The June year-to-date result is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88% to 90%.","Property\/liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, property\/liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior-year result, while the $477 million of operating income through the first six months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first six months of 2015.","The bottom of this slide contains growth trend information as well as a view of property\/liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. On the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows our policy in force trend.","Property\/liability policies in force declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. These trends have been heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these two trends reflects increases in average premium per policy given ongoing rate increases.","The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property\/liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see on the red line, recorded results in the first two quarters of 2016 have been impacted by a higher level of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2%.","Slide seven provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8% in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. A lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter.","Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity along with the aggressive actions we continue to take have enabled us to keep auto margins stable despite the continued challenging auto loss cost environment. The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio.","Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to increase, as approved rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The positive gap between these two trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015.","The bottom two charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claim staffing, evaluating cost trends, and estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly is as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportion of claims we close with a payment. The relationship between these two measures will fluctuate over time, given environmental impacts and claim department process changes.","As you can see in the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they had been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars was enhanced. As the impacts from safety improvements fully worked their way into the fleet, we saw flattening trend for approximately five years. Now the results we\u2019ve seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. This most recent period reflects just how challenging an auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in.","We first identified the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014, and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue along with our proactive and aggressive response will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as loss trends stabilize.","We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on slide eight.","Given ongoing auto loss pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first six months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart on the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were approved in 35 states and Canadian provinces, and were on average 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate.","The impact of these rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown in the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes take six months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while they take at least 12 months to be fully earned into the P&L.","The significant amount of premium we\u2019ve generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far. So if we had not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower and we\u2019d be playing catch-up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides.","We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local market where we feel comfortable that we\u2019ve achieved rate adequacy.","Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with repairing newer, more sophisticated vehicles, and greater total loss volume on older model year cars.","Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year.","Property\/liability expense ratio decreased by 0.8 point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect to accelerate these investment as loss trends stabilize.","Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on slide nine. On the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first two quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis was 83.5% as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6% underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior-year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are on the chart on the right. Average earned premium per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior-year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%.","Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line trends for Esurance. I will begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 108.9% in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5% remains higher than where we would like it to perform in the long term.","On the right, you can see Esurance\u2019s premium and policy in force trends. Growth in Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions, including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments, and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies, which are represented by the gray line, declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium in the second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy.","Encompass\u2019s results are highlighted on page 11. The left hand chart summarizes our combined ratio trends. Encompass\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 104.9% in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior-year quarter, driven by a lower level of catastrophes, a reduced expense ratio, and a 2.4-point improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8% was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of ongoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target margins.","The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium, as shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass has continued to take actions to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract coverage, and underwriting sophistication.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Shebik","Thank you, Pat.","Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial\u2019s results for the second quarter of 2016. We have refocused Allstate Financial over the past several years primarily on business written through the Allstate agencies and on voluntary workplace products for customers of Allstate Benefits. The annuity product line is closed to new business and is effectively in run-off.","Premium and contract charges totaled $564 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges was driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter, with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months.","Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. Across the top of the slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Life business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year.","The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015\u2019s portfolio repositioning and worse mortality. The chart on the bottom right shows the liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuitants over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we\u2019ve repositioned this portfolio from longer-duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments and sharper higher risk-adjusted returns.","Now let\u2019s go on to slide 13. We\u2019ve been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile and the low interest rate environment while reducing the portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to an eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio over time, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition the portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment-grade, fixed income, and increase in performance-based investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber, and agriculture. Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher but more variable returns over time.","We\u2019ve created capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decreasing exposure to natural catastrophes, and shrinking our annuity business.","Total return for the quarter, on the upper right, remained strong at 1.9%, as valuations continue to be positive, reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased to $2.7 billion. Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability in income largely results from our performance-based investments, shown in gray.","Investment yields by the business segment are provided on the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the property\/liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile.","The Allstate Financial yield trend reflects the impact of last year\u2019s portfolio repositioning when we sold longer-duration fixed income securities in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except for the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield at Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. Yields of both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rates remain below the portfolio averages.","Slide 14 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders\u2019 equity, a debt to capital ratio of 19.9%, and deployable holding company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains.","We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through the first six months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividends and repurchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23 of this year. As of June 30, $1.2 billion remained of the $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization.","With that, let me ask Jonathan to open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Greg Peters","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Pat, on the promotion.","Pat Macellaro","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Peters","I wanted to focus on two areas, one on the rate change in your auto, and then secondly on distribution platform. In addition to the comments you made on rate change, I was looking at slide 14 in your supplement. And the auto for Allstate brand was up 3.2% in the second quarter. That\u2019s a noticeable change from previous quarters, and I\u2019m curious if there was some geographic concentration with the rate change, or is it broad-based. I think the annualized pace of that is in excess of 12%, so I\u2019m also curious about any regulatory pushback or competitive issues there too.","Tom Wilson","Greg, do you want to give us your distribution question too, so we can \u2013 maybe they link together, I\u2019m not sure, but we can handle both of them that way.","Greg Peters","Yes, sure. On the distribution side, I noticed that the total number of Allstate agencies, licensed sales professionals, and independent agents all increased on a year-over-year basis. And I\u2019m just curious if you can update us on what you\u2019re doing there and how you\u2019re able to grow that business in a challenging marketplace.","Tom Wilson","Okay, Matt can deal with both of those. Let me just give him a little bit of air cover, which is we always encourage you not to take our quarterly results and multiply them by four.","Matt Winter","Good morning, Greg, it\u2019s Matt. Thanks for the questions. I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states, and that impacted it disproportionately when you look at it on a countrywide impact.","So you are correct, it is disproportionately high to what you had been seeing, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter \u2013 for the rest of the year. However, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say we\u2019re going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average. But when it\u2019s in larger states, it will have a larger impact. And so it will fluctuate because it\u2019s based upon need and indication in particular geographic areas as opposed \u2013 which has a countrywide impact, but you can\u2019t think of it as a countrywide rate increase.","The second question on distribution, it\u2019s been a tough period, yet we\u2019ve been able to hold fast and slightly grow some of our distribution points of presence. It\u2019s hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you\u2019re taking a lot of rate, when there\u2019s a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turnover rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past. But we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we\u2019ll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs [Licensed Sales Producers], and I would add additional financial specialists because we think the fact that we entered this phase early, took action quickly and aggressively will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question.","Greg Peters","It does, thank you very much for the answers.","Tom Wilson","Greg, let me add a longer-term view to that as well. So we have 10% of the overall auto market. We have a bigger share of the lower left, but not such a big share that we don\u2019t think there\u2019s plenty of room to grow.","Greg Peters","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I was just hoping to talk a little bit about the expense level. It did rise a little bit in the quarter. And I know you can look at it year over year, but it rose from how it had been trending in the past few quarters on a sequential basis. Can you just comment on what\u2019s driving that? And I know last quarter you guys had spoken to some advertising programs rolling out in the later stages of this year. Is that still the case as we continue to see the elevated frequency trends?","Tom Wilson","As you noted, we did decide we would reduce those expenses that were related to growth when we were not in the market for new customers. So Matt just mentioned, for example, not adding a bunch of new agency owners. That costs money to do that because we have to help them get started and get supported. We did launch our new advertising program already, and so you\u2019ve started to see that uptick that portion of expenses. So the expense reductions are not as great as they were in prior quarters and the year-over-year comparison.","So we manage it both on a short-term and long-term basis. We try to control our expenses in total to make sure we\u2019re achieving our target returns. On the other hand, we\u2019re not willing to give up our long-term growth. So I would just say it\u2019s balanced. It\u2019s hard to predict where your expenses and your frequency and severity will be in a quarter obviously on a forward-looking basis. So we manage it on a rolling 12-months basis.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then on slide seven, where you guys go through the frequency trends, I was just trying to tie together some of the trends on both the growth and the pay side. So the pay trends improved in the quarter, while the growth trends continued to remain elevated. I\u2019m just trying to tie together why the improvement on the pay side wouldn\u2019t necessarily be an indicator that incurred frequency trends are improving. And the also within the Auto book, was there any kind of seasonality within the underlying numbers in the quarter as we think about the margins in the back half of the year?","Matt Winter","Elyse, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll try to answer both of those. I think just the graph, the side-by-side of gross and paid is informative because we\u2019ve tracked both and reported on both. They serve different purposes, as Pat described, and they show up differently. Clearly in gross, it\u2019s a leading indicator. So you\u2019re reporting on and showing everything that\u2019s coming in that might be a claim. And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information, and clearly there\u2019s some segment of this that is closed without payment.","But for these, and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we\u2019re trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing need, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to over-capture obviously what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap. It\u2019s especially true on BI because of the long tail, and that\u2019s a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure.","You also see some small areas where it seems out of pattern, Elyse, but it\u2019s really a question of catching up. It\u2019s a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It\u2019s a question of figuring out what demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on [ph] Sebrough as well. Sometimes, we\u2019ll get hit with a big lump of [ph] Sebrough (35:28) claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up. And all of a sudden, they come in. And so I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there\u2019s a catch-up. As you had a backlog, things slowed down, and then it\u2019s pushed through. You manage to clear a lot of claims. And so it will never mirror it exactly. But it\u2019s eerily similar, if pushed over a little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. And then just lastly, was there any seasonality within the auto underlying numbers in the quarter, as you think about the back half and the Q3 and the Q4 of 2016?","Matt Winter","I\u2019d encourage you to look back historically on quarter-by-quarter underlying. I don\u2019t want to draw a bunch of general conclusions for you, but I think you will see there is seasonality, not only in the recorded, but there is always some seasonality in the underlying based upon weather and other activities. And so I\u2019d encourage you to look, and we do have the historical graphs, and that\u2019s apparent from taking a look at that.","Tom Wilson","Elyse, we have not changed our full-year outlook, which is the way we like to look at it. As Matt points out, it bounces around by quarter. Our full-year outlook is still 88% to 90% for underlying combined ratio.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Pat Macellaro","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Ryan Tunis","Hi, thanks. I guess the first one, just following up on some of Elyse\u2019s questions on the difference between paid and gross. Some of that new disclosure, I think it\u2019s a footnote in the supplement, seems to indicate that one of the biggest differences is vehicle on non-vehicle collisions. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to drill into that a little bit more, anything you can give us on either what percentage of your claims base tends to be vehicle on non-vehicle, how the average severity of those non-vehicle crashes compares to the vehicle-on-vehicle, or just how to think about the \u2013 I realize a lot of those don\u2019t close with a claim. But how do we think about the percentage of those that close with a claim versus the percentage that close with a claim on just a vehicle-on-vehicle?","Matt Winter","Okay, thanks for the question, Ryan. It\u2019s Matt. So I just want to point out and restate what I said in answering Elyse\u2019s question. So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really digging at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern and make sure that we were ahead of the game in both an ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent you can, emerging trends.","And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call hit fixed object or non-vehicle accidents. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It\u2019s less likely to be a snow bank in July and August. Sometimes it\u2019s something that can result in a claim, like a mailbox or somebody\u2019s tree or a garage door or something like that, and sometimes it\u2019s something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did. And as a result, we were probably capturing and continue to capture some incidents that, when you look at it, you\u2019re less likely to think it\u2019s going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process.","As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there has been a gross frequency per PD increase, and we quantified that. It\u2019s about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015. It\u2019s about two points in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s about three points in the second quarter of 2016. And so you\u2019ll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the \u201cgross\u201d numbers, unadjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we\u2019re capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement and they\u2019re not impacting our paid, but we wanted to capture it to see trends. And when you\u2019re as large as we are, every little change in what you capture in claims opening practices can influence the gross number.","Tom Wilson","Ryan, this is Tom. When Matt said this, I want to go a level below that, which is in doing our net income and our reserving processes, we use actual claim counts and severity by type of loss. As you know, some longer-tail businesses where they don\u2019t have the data that we do on a real-time basis, they book to estimated loss ratios. When Matt is talking about what we\u2019re doing with claim counts, that\u2019s all factored in. So we have greater precision in the way we estimate our current income levels.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up, we\u2019ve heard some of the life companies this quarter talk about the impact of the pullback in interest rates both on the income statement and also some charges. I guess just with Allstate, maybe looking out over the next 12 months, I don\u2019t know, maybe even 24 months, how should we be thinking about the income statement of low interest rates, and I guess also the impact it could have in terms of GAAP charges or stat [statutory] charges on the runoff life block? Thanks.","Steve Shebik","So, Ryan, this is Steve. Let me talk a little bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you\u2019re referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for property\/liability, it\u2019s fairly close.","For life, there\u2019s a difference. Obviously, we have longer duration assets. We\u2019re getting good yields on those today, but they slowly run off over time. The good news is for us, unlike many other companies, we\u2019ve been paying out our run-off annuity liabilities with a lot of that cash flow that\u2019s coming from the portfolio. So we haven\u2019t had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that\u2019s slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we\u2019re investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration than many of our competitors in terms of \u2013 because we\u2019re running it off.","So if you look at that \u2013 and performance-based investments we believe would earn substantially higher albeit variable returns over a period of time than you would in fixed income. So we feel our income for Allstate Financial, should hold on to investments, should hold reasonably well. There\u2019s going to be a slowdown turn, as you can imagine, given some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do in managing the portfolio on a routine basis.","In terms of charges, probably I think you\u2019re thinking of a premium deficiency charge. We aggregate all of our life and annuity businesses, and we disclose this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have stat sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that, and once again, having it be a performance-based investment will help us significantly in terms of increasing and holding the returns we have in those long-dated annuities. I hope that helps \u2013 answers your question.","Ryan Tunis","And I guess how about on a stat basis, like an [ph] AAT) or anything like that at year end?","Steve Shebik","On a stat basis, we do look at that at year end, as you say. I don\u2019t have any really current comments on that. But once again, it really is based upon where your investment income is coming out and moving more towards performance-based investing should help us on that.","Tom Wilson","And last year we did take a charge on stat of about $259 million.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, thanks so much for your answers, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please.","Josh Stirling","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the call and congratulations on the quarter. So I was hoping you guys can \u2013 we\u2019re all sitting here trying to figure out how to model your earnings going out over the next couple of years and balancing basically frequency trends, severity trends you\u2019re talking about, as well as the very active pricing campaign you\u2019re managing.","And I was wondering if you could help us. I\u2019m not asking for guidance per se, but help us understand. Remind us a bit at the business segment level what the underlying combined ratio targets you guys are trying to get to are. Because we can do our own math about judging how long you\u2019ll get there, but I think it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had that conversation. And as you\u2019ve made a lot of changes in Encompass and Esurance in particular, I don\u2019t think that we actually really know for certain what we should be looking to as the long-term goals for those businesses.","Tom Wilson","Good morning, Josh. Let me go way up for a minute and I\u2019ll come down. So we expect all of our businesses to earn a current return on the business they write over our cost of capital. So we start there, and that\u2019s true with all of our businesses today. But then what we do is we adjust it for what our strategies and the volatility of earnings are. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, it\u2019s lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital because it\u2019s more volatile.","We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business, but then Matt and his team push it down by state. So we\u2019ve always talked about the system we have. That system includes taking economic capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi on the coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so homeowners will always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business.","The auto business, we don\u2019t give a target like some of our competitors do. But if you looked at where we\u2019ve operated, it\u2019s been where GEICO and Progressive is, which call it the [ph] mid-90s%. That\u2019s a place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That\u2019s where we look to be at, in that zone, but we don\u2019t have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year.","If you look at the other property\/liability businesses, they look more like auto insurance than they do homeowner insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all of your money up front getting new customers, and it gets expensed right away, as opposed to in the Allstate channel, we\u2019re providing service all along. So the commissions we paid our customers to provide that service get amortized all along.","So you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of its size and the growth potential we have in that segment. So as long as Don\u2019s team is creating economic value, we will continue to invest because we believe we\u2019re creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current earnings. So if you look at the underwriting loss, we\u2019ve been running underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it\u2019s double its size. And if you double its size, we believe we\u2019ve created a lot of economic value.","Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other one. So that\u2019s how we think \u2013 obviously, we have similar conversations for the life business and Allstate Benefits. Is that helpful?","Josh Stirling","That makes sense. If I could just \u2013 I\u2019ll use my one last follow-up on similar points. If I try to keep it at 50,000 feet, it feels like your guys\u2019 auto businesses are running a couple of points below \u2013 or above where you would like them to be. If we assume that you can fix those over the next couple of years, that would be fantastic for margins. One, is that sort of the right way to think about if you guys can get ahead with pricing and\/or you get a tailwind because frequency trends stabilize or even reverse?","And then I guess the other thing that\u2019s implicit in that assumption is that you\u2019ll be able to maintain margins you\u2019ve currently been getting in homeowners. And we haven\u2019t been talking about that quite as much because auto has been the focus. But does that \u2013 if you\u2019re thinking about this big picture and staying at that level, are those sort of the right ways we should be thinking about this?","Tom Wilson","Yes, it is. I would say, if you look at where we operated the auto insurance business with flat severity, as Matt pointed out, for a long period of time we\u2019ve had flat severity \u2013 or sorry, flat frequency. Thank you, Pat. We would like flat severity. But we were able to operate that business at a combined ratio below where it is today. We see no change in our capabilities relative to our competitors, no change in the overall competitive environment that tells us we can\u2019t be back in that space. It will take us some time given that those frequency numbers have been headed up and we price on a lag basis, but we see no reason why we can\u2019t get there.","The homeowners business has been successfully repositioned, and we\u2019re zeroing in on around four years of the new environment, and we see no reason why we can\u2019t continue to maintain that profitability where it is today.","Josh Stirling","Great. Thank you, good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning, and thanks for fitting me in. Just two quick questions, if I may. First of all, again, going back to slide seven, could you perhaps give us more color as to what exactly are these type of claims that are being closed without payment, and has that percentage increased?","Tom Wilson","The percentage on it bounces around a lot. For example, let\u2019s say somebody called us and they had a claim and their deductible is $1,000, and the damage was $700. We close that claim without payment. There are lots of reasons. It could be they called us, and the other person was at fault. And so there are lots of things that happen where we don\u2019t have to actually pay money. But we want to know that somebody has a claim so that we can respond proactively and do what we get paid for, which is help them at that time of trouble.","Steve Shebik","On the macro level, it fluctuates a lot, but the trend hasn\u2019t changed.","Amit Kumar","Got it, that\u2019s actually quite helpful. The other question which we were getting was on advertising. I know you talked about this. Going back, I thought the thought process was that the advertising piece will come back once the book is fixed and under control. And I think some people were surprised on the tick up in the advertising level. Maybe just talk about that. Did we misunderstand you at that point, or you have greater comfort where we are right now and hence that\u2019s why it\u2019s ticking up?","Tom Wilson","I can\u2019t speak for what people thought we said, but what I can do is say we\u2019re comfortable doing more advertising. But I would also point out, it\u2019s really marketing because there\u2019s a tremendous \u2013 we have made a huge shift in our allocations away from TV to digital over the last couple of years. So you might not see as many ads on TV, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not out banging away trying to find new customers. But we\u2019re comfortable from both an ongoing standpoint we need to invest to make sure our brand is out there and relevant; and secondly, that we\u2019re advertising for the types of customers that we have the ability to take in.","Amit Kumar","And does that run rate go up from here or remain stable?","Tom Wilson","It varies by quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to, Amit, I wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on it. I would think about expenses overall. We think about expenses as a way to provide both on opportunity for us to grow and great service for our customers. Right now, our expense levels are down. If we had a lower loss ratio and we felt like we could expand, we would then continue to invest until we thought the average acquisition cost was too high.","Amit Kumar","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Tom Wilson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. The first question is on the inflection point on your core loss ratio in the auto book. You\u2019ve been starting raising price actively the second quarter of last year. Given the short-tail nature of your business, I was wondering when do you think that will eventually earn through above your loss cost trends. And also your second quarter this year, a big increase in terms of approved rate increases. Do we have to wait until these chunks earn in to see that inflection point?","Steve Shebik","The answer to the first one is it all depends what you think is going to happen to frequency. And we can\u2019t predict the bottom part of that chart that Pat and Matt talked about. We can\u2019t predict that. So as Matt indicated, as long as it\u2019s going up, we will continue to adjust our pricing to reflect the cost that we have to cover for our customers.","When it will go through will be \u2013 and you\u2019ll see it in the P&L, is when it exceeds the growth in frequency and severity. It didn\u2019t happen this quarter versus the second quarter of next year, but we don\u2019t price just to hold even. So at some point, we would expect to get back to that loss ratio that we talked about earlier.","Matt Winter","And I\u2019d add, Kai, I think you asked about the timing. It does \u2013 since they\u2019re six-month policies, it does take 12 full months to fully earn in, and it\u2019s earned in in the 13th month. So you can\u2019t accelerate that. That\u2019s just a function of how the rates work in the system. And so you can look at what our effective rate is, and we talk about the effective rate increase and how much is likely to burn in as a result when it\u2019s fully developed, and some of that will actually burn in, in 2017 of what we took in second quarter of 2016.","Kai Pan","That\u2019s great. The second question is on Arity. Could you talk even more about your business model there? And over time, what\u2019s the value you could provide to Allstate, both strategic as well as economic value to your franchise, and how much investment you need to make in that unit?","Tom Wilson","Okay, Kai, let me answer it first with a two-component stance. One is the overall environment and second is Allstate specifically. So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring of it. Just a few statistics, there are 240 million cars in the United States. They\u2019re worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect costs, and it\u2019s very inefficient.","Capacity utilization is about 4% in total. It\u2019s about 33% at peak hours. And then you see one person in a car most of the time rather than multiple people. So everywhere I look I see idle cars, and if they\u2019re moving they only have one passenger. At the same time, there are about 30,000 people killed in that system, and there\u2019s billions of hours spent either sitting in traffic or waiting looking for a parking spot. We can do better. If it was your system, you\u2019d shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis, so there\u2019s big money here. The train is on the track. It\u2019s moving and it\u2019s picking up speed.","So what\u2019s Allstate going to do about that? First, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our pricing. So today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With Drivewise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and price it with real driving behavior. That gives us a more accurate price. We\u2019re also testing pricing plans so that you can continue to pay us like we do today, over six months, as Matt talked about, or you can pay us per mile if you want to. There are lots of things that will happen in the personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate.","At the same time, we\u2019re broadening that value proposition to customers beyond just pricing so that they get more from Allstate than just advice on how to protect themselves and more than help in fixing their car when they get in an accident. So today, for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to do better driving. We connect them with roadside so they can be \u2013 contextually we can get there faster. We\u2019re also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rewards. So we\u2019re both doing a better job on what we currently offer, and we\u2019re expanding the offering we give them.","Now there are many companies that want to get in this space, and we think we have a natural way in because it\u2019s direct and it\u2019s low friction in terms of giving customers direct benefit from the connection. So it\u2019s our belief that we can use that connection then for multiple purposes such as road usage or providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by a customer\u2019s interest and the time-and-place specific location they\u2019re at. So as a result of that, we created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on one platform. So the strategy is strengthen our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers.","We don\u2019t disclose the amount of money. We don\u2019t get to 1 million customers without spending some money on it, but we don\u2019t break that number out.","Kai Pan","Thank you very much.","Pat Macellaro","Hey, Jonathan, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019d be interested to get your perspective on loss trends. Why do you think they haven\u2019t stabilized yet, particularly given we\u2019ve lapped on lower gas prices and the economy isn\u2019t booming?","Tom Wilson","I think you answered part of the question there, which is people do three things in their cars. They go to work, they run errands, and they take trips. It\u2019s about a third each of those roughly speaking. So as more people are working, they drive to work more. That creates more economic activity, which also makes the roads more crowded. The trips tend to \u2013 errands tend to not move around that much. And then you have trips. And so lower gas prices help. Matt, anything you want to add?","Matt Winter","I would add, Sarah, in addition to the miles driven, which is, as Tom said, miles driven is really a factor of gas prices, employment rate because that drives those behaviors. The other component that is a little more difficult to quantify but we know it\u2019s out there is the level of distracted driving that\u2019s taking place today. And that distracted driving, the use of cellphones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we\u2019ve all watched it. Some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes. And the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there\u2019s less space in between those cars.","When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and going to hard stops, it\u2019s an increased likelihood that they\u2019re going to hit somebody else. So it\u2019s a perfect storm to have a greater number of cars on the road driving faster, and we have lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our Drivewise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips, and greater speed during those trips. So it\u2019s a bad combination when you add to it people looking at their cell phone instead of being focused on their driving.","Tom Wilson","And then as we mentioned, as well the loss cost and the same trends that Matt and Pat talked about, which is cars are more expensive. Knock off your mirror, it\u2019s $1,000, not $150, because it\u2019s got all the sensors and stuff on it.","Tom Wilson","So let me just close with we take a proactive approach to the current environment, making sure we invest for the long-term strategic growth opportunity. So we\u2019re adapting to the higher cost of socio and auto insurance, as most of you have asked us about. But I want to be clear. It\u2019s comprehensive in a multi-faceted approach. It\u2019s not just about raising price. So we\u2019re taking a more segmented approach to that. We are managing risk-adjusted returns to create shareholder value. That\u2019s like what we did in homeowners, where we got smaller to get better, or as we\u2019re doing today in payout annuities.","We are focused on growth, whether that\u2019s Allstate Benefits, Allstate agencies and their relationships with the 16 million households, Esurance, or our telematics offering. We are investing for long-term growth and will continue to do so. So we have a strategy, resources, and a team to continue to create value for our shareholders. So thank you again for spending time with us this quarter and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Griek","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik, and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","In December, we announced that John Dugenske will be joining Allstate as Chief Investment Officer in early 2017. John will join the team next month and will be part of our quarterly earnings calls beginning next quarter.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted the results presentation we will discuss this morning. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. We plan to file our 2016, Form 10-K later this month.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson","Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. Let\u2019s start on Slide 2, we delivered excellent results for the year and finished 2016 with another strong quarter as we continue to effectively execute our short-term plans and build on long-term strategies. As a result, Allstate\u2019s well positioned for continued success.","Auto profit improvement plans over the last two years have enabled us to begin to withstand growth in 2017, while being able to react further auto loss cost increases.","The homeowners business continues to generate attractive returns despite higher catastrophe losses. Investment results for the year was good, but bounced around from quarter-to-quarter reflecting volatile external conditions. At the same time we\u2019re investing growth both with existing businesses and new opportunities.","Net income was $811 million for the quarter and $1.76 billion for the year. Operating income was $2.17 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.87 per share for the year. The recorded combined ratio for the year was a touch over 96 and underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the range we provided shareholders a year ago.","Shareholders received $1.8 billion in cash through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also welcome the Square Trade into the fold providing shareholders another opportunity for profitable growth.","Going to the back to the bottom, total revenues of $9.3 billion for the fourth quarter reflected 2.8% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums driven by the continued implementation plan and higher performance based investment income.","Net income for the fourth quarter was $811 million and operating income was $807 million. Operating income benefited from favorable underlying loss performance in both, auto and homeowners insurance, lower catastrophe losses, favorable prior year reserve releases and strong investment income.","The Property-Liability insurance business performed well as a result of the successful execution of the auto profit improvement plan across the three underwritten brands and continued excellent performance in the Allstate brand homeowners and other personal lines insurance.","Allstate Financial had a strong quarter with $130 million of operating income as the newer businesses benefitted from the very high investment income from the performance based portfolio.","Moving over to the full year columns at the right, the 12 months operating return on equity was 10.4% and that\u2019s down slightly from the prior year, largely reflecting higher catastrophe losses in 2016. Consolidated Policies in Force declined modestly over the year, as strong growth at Allstate Benefits was more than offset by decrease in Property-Liability business.","Looking forward to 2017 on Slide 3, we\u2019re in a position to achieve an improved underlying combined ratio and achieve our five operating priorities both of which have both short-term growth and long-term objectives.","We expect to build on last year\u2019s insurance margin improvement, resulting in an annual underlying combined ratio between 87 and 89 in 2017. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions.","First, there will be continued improvement in auto insurance profitability as increases in average premiums and filed rates gives the flexibility to deal with increases in the frequency into various auto actions [ph].","Secondly, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio would deteriorate slightly from 2016, but this will be well within our target range of profitability. Encompass and Esurance are assumed to stay on track to improve auto profitability. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to invest in growth across the company.","Our priorities for 2017 remain largely consistent with 2016. The first three priorities, better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base or [indiscernible] and ensure that corporation has multiple paths to profitable long-term growth.","In 2017, we expect to grow our customer base with continued positive growth in Allstate Benefits and Esurance, rapid growth in our newly acquired consumer product protection plan business Square Trade and by reducing the number of policy losses under the Allstate and Encompass brands.","As you know, we proactively manage $82 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk adjusted return overtime. Net investment income is relatively stable with the large fixed income portfolio and then additional income comes from the performance based investment. The total return on the portfolio will be largely dependent on U.S. interest rates and economic growth.","Our fifth priority continues to focus on building long-term growth platforms. The Allstate Agencies platform is being strengthened by rolling up the trusted advisor initiative. Esurance will continue to expand in auto and homeowners insurance. Allstate Benefits will continue to leverage its position in a high growth solitary benefits market. Arity will grow both the telematics business and Square Trade will continue to gain new retail partners.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 4 to cover property-liability results. Net written premium grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter and average premium increases were partly offset by a 2.8% decline in policies in forced. Fourth quarter catastrophe losses of 303 million were 15.4% lower than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses for the year, however, were nearly $2.6 billion, which was $863 million higher than 2015.","The reported combined ratio for property-liability was 89.9 in the fourth quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes in prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.7, bringing the full year to 87.9. The four customer segments of the property-liability market are shown in the diagram at the bottom of the page. As you know, Allstate is the only company that provides a differentiated value proposition to each of these customer segments.","The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written, that serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local relationships. Underlying margin improvement throughout the year of the Allstate brand was driven by the progress made in the auto insurance business. Homeowners insurance and other personal lines continued a strong profitability.","Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer branded products that are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improved the year, but it\u2019s above our long-term target with the fourth quarter being somewhat elevated. The homeowners business is growing rapidly. The loss ratio is within expectation. But the underlying profitability was negatively impacted by start-up advertising costs.","Encompass in the upper right competes for customers who want local advice and less concerned about brand experience and are served by independent agencies. We remain focused on improvement of returns in executing our profit improvement plan in this spring.","Allstate Financial in the upper right serves brand neutral self-served customers and is an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risk. We\u2019ll cover the results of these underwritten brands in more detail on the subsequent slides.","Now, let me turn it over to John.","John Griek","Let\u2019s go to Slide 5 to cover the results for Allstate Brand Auto. The recorded combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 95.3, which was 3.3 points below the prior year quarter and benefited from prior year reserve re-estimates. The quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios are shown on the chart on the top left.","The underlying combined ratio of 96.1 in the fourth quarter of 2016 improved by 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. This brought our full year underlying combined ratio to 96.4, nearly a 4 point below year end 2015 results.","The chart on the top right shows the drivers of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio. Annualized average premium increased to $978 or 7.1%, while underlying loss in expenses increased by 5.5%. This resulted in a favorable gap of $38 comparable to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, loss trend benefited from favorable current accident year reserve development with 0.7 points.","To provide addition insight into our loss trend side coverage, the bottom half of the page shows the paid severity and frequency trends for both property damage and bodily injury. Property damage paid frequency shown by the blue bar continues to show an improving trend. After experiencing elevated levels in the second half of 2014 through the first quarter of 2016, results in the second, third quarter of 2016 were essentially flat and the fourth quarter experienced a decline of 1.2%.","Property damage paid severity increased by a modest 1.9% in the quarter and the rate of increases come down throughout 2016. Bodily injury paid frequency decreased 19.2% in the fourth quarter, while paid severity increased by 18.8%. These results are consistent with the trends experienced in the third quarter.","Frequency and severity should be looked at in combination to get a sense of the true underlying loss trends. As we discussed in the third quarter call, bodily injury trends reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in claims processes in the second half of 2016.","These changes involved requiring enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatment and resulted in a reduction in the mix of smaller dollar claims paid. The increases in severity of larger dollar claims are more consistent with medical inflation and we continue to be comfortable with our bodily injury in current severity trends.","Slide 6 provides detail on premium and policy growth for Allstate brand auto. The chart on the top left highlights our premium trend. Average premium as shown by the blue bar increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter, a slight deceleration compared to the upward trend beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium shown by the gray line was up 6.8% and continue to increase, reflecting the lag between written and earned premium recognition.","Since the end of 2014, auto average premium has increased by over 11% in total. We\u2019ve continued to get approval for higher auto prices where appropriate as part of our comprehensive auto property improvement plan. In the fourth quarter, approved rate increases totaled 1.3% for the Allstate brand, bringing the full year approved rate increases to 7.2%.","While our comprehensive auto property improvement plan has improved margins, it\u2019s also reduced growth as we anticipated. New business applications shown on the top right were down 21.9% for the full year. However, we are flat to the prior year quarter. Additionally, auto retention shown on the bottom left was down 0.8 points in the quarter and for the year. The combination of these two factors resulted in a decline of 2.9% in auto policies in 2016. However, both trends have stabilized in the quarter.","Slide 7 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results, showing that we continue to generate attractive returns with the recorded combined ratio of 68.7 in the fourth quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophe losses despite Hurricane Matthew and the Tennessee fires.","For the full year, the recorded combined ratio was 83.7, generating an excess of $1 billion in underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 59.1 for the quarter and 59.5 for the year continues to reflect strong underlying profitability. While our underlying combined ratio results for the year have been excellent, our long-term target for this line remains in the low 60\u2019s.","The bottom half of the page provides detail on our growth trend which follow the auto lines since many of the customers in this segment preferred to bundle their purchases. New business and retention levels declined leading to a 1.2% decline in policies in force.","Slide 8 provides a holistic view of our Esurance results. We continue to remain focused on improving auto profitability while investing in product and geographic expansion. The recorded combined ratio of 105 in the fourth quarter was 2 points below the prior year quarter and through the year the Esurance combined ratio was 107.5 lower than the prior year period by 2.8 points driven by lower expenses. The lower expense ratio for the year reflects reduced advertising expense.","The underlying loss ratio of 76.3 is higher than long-term target, primarily due to higher auto claim frequency and severity and we will continue to take actions to enhance Esurance returns. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the bottom of the page. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased rate actions, while policies in force were slightly higher than the prior year end.","Slide 9 highlights results for Encompass. Encompass remains focused on improving returns, which continues to adversely impact policy growth trends. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 90 and 90.7 in the fourth quarter were better than the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, the underlying combined ratio was 90.3, a 2.3 point improvement compared to prior year. Policies in force declined by 13.4% from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting both continued lower new business and retention. The majority of decline in policies in force was in six states.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Shebik","Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 10, Allstate financial premiums and contract charges totaled $574 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 4.9% when compared to the prior year quarter. For the year, premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% as Allstate benefits surpassed $1 billion in premium with an increase of 442,000 policies.","Allstate Financial operating income of $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $32 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015.","Net and operating income trends by business are shown in the chart at the bottom of the page. Allstate Life net income was $58 million and operating income was $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was consistent with the prior year quarter and higher premiums and improved mortality were offset by lower net investment income.","Allstate Benefits\u2019 net income was $22 million and operating income was $23 million in 2016\u2019s fourth quarter. Operating income was flat to the prior year quarter as higher premiums from policy growth were offset by higher benefits, decamization [ph] and technology related expenses.","We expect to make additional investments in technology as this business grows. The $33 million increase in operating income in Allstate Annuity business compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 is a result of higher returns and performance based investments. The chart on the top right highlights the growth in carrying value and in annualized yield for Allstate Financials performance based investments, which primarily back the immediate annuity business.","Net investment income of $101 million on these investments in the fourth quarter was very strong and was almost $30 million higher than the average of the preceding seven quarters. We anticipate continued variability given the timing of investment origination and disposition and market condition.","Let\u2019s go on to Slide 11 and our investment results. The chart at the upper left shows the shift we made in the risk profile of $81.8 billion investment portfolio. The portfolio remains largely in corporate fixed income securities. To support long-dated liabilities, we are replacing market risk with idiosyncratic risk through an emphasis on ownership over lending.","The conservatively positioned high yield portfolio is being used in part as a bridge to fund performance based strategies that will be used as this portfolio increases. Performance based investments now comprise $6 billion or 7% of the portfolio. These assets require higher economic and regulatory capital and we expect them to deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders.","In the upper right, total return for the quarter was a negative 0.7%, reflecting the decline in fixed income investment values due to the post-election increase in interest rates. The full year return was a strong 4.4%. As you can see in the chart, solid investment income from both our market base and performance based portfolios has delivered a consistent contribution to return of approximately 1% each quarter.","Net investment income and investment yield by business segment are shown in the bottom two charts. Property-liability investment income reflects interest-bearing yields closer to market yields and the portfolios low to the short duration. Allstate Financials\u2019 investment income and yields reflects portfolio\u2019s longer duration based upon its liability structure, the impact of last year\u2019s immediate annuity portfolio to reposition.","Performance based investment results are the primary source of variability income and yields between quarters and you can see the numbers above the chart in the bottom left. Performance based investment returns in the fourth quarter were above our long-term target as we had strong results in the quarter, which included income realization on direct real estate investments and substantial appreciation on our coupons [ph].","Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion at year end, increased $550 million over year end 2015. The debt to capital ratio of 23.6% reflects the issuance of $1.25 billion in senior unsecured debt in December to help fund the acquisition of Square Trade, which closed January 3rd. We have $2.4 billion in deployable holding company asset at year end, which excluded the funds utilized with the Square Trade acquisition.","Book value per share of $50.77 increased by 7.2% over year end 2015, primarily due to net income and increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion of cash to common shareholders in 2016 with a combination of $486 million in shareholder dividends and the repurchase over 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. As of December 31, 2016, it was $691 million remaining on the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization.","Now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo, your question please.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, guys. Good morning. My first question, what are all the favorable development within your auto book in the quarter and did that come from some of the most recent accident years?","John Griek","Steve, do you want to take that?","Steve Shebik","So, what we - it\u2019s Steve. The results that we look at, as you know, from our reserving processes is we do a quarterly review, bottoms up. We have - the reserving department reports to me, I\u2019m separate from our business unit and we look, as you indicated, year-by-year we look at virtually every states. We have a very specific program, methodology both mathematically and quantitative, qualitatively as we walk through the results. We look at by line of business.","We look at tremendous amount of details. So, the actual results that you are seeing are based on across multiple lines and across multiple of our prior years. You will see in the 10-K that we filed, we have some additional information. It would give you a little more details of the specific years. But quarterly it\u2019s not just like 2015 or \u201814. It goes back to the full year, which is the nature of our business and the length of the tail of our bodily injury type coverage\u2019s in addition to the short tail you might see that we generally would report earlier in the year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, but some of it should relate I guess to the more recent accident years and we were seeing some of the higher frequency trends like \u201814 and \u201815?","Steve Shebik","The frequency shows up immediately, right, because we do it based on count. Some people do target loss ratios. That\u2019s not the way we do most of our reserving. We do it with some lines of business, but what happens is, of course, some people say, well, we think we are going to get 70 loss ratio, so they take 1000 a premium and they book 700 of loss and that\u2019s not the way we do it in our business, because of the short tail nature of it. So, what you see is what you get. There is also a little bit of movement between quarters. So, as we - which doesn\u2019t show up in the triangles in the 10-K but we adjust as we go throughout the year to reflect what we are seeing in the specific year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. And then as I think, as we see the frequency trends got a lot better again in the fourth quarter and you guys reported a pretty good improvement within your auto margin and now on the commentary, some of your commentary points that you\u2019re looking kind of to pursue growth, can you just provide some more color. I mean, is this you are looking in certain states I guess that are showing better trends than other or is this broad-based and how do you think about both new business which I did see flattened out in the quarter, new business growth from here as well as just pursuing growth and higher retentions across overall auto book of business?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","I\u2019ll make the one overall perspective and then Matt will give you some specifics. I would not interpret this quarter as that was then and this was now. That was going back to where we were. Miles driven were still up to the quarter. People continue to drive more than they have in the past. Accidents tends to be more frequent distracted driving [ph]. I would not want you to take away from the fourth quarter that we are headed back to where we were. Matt can talk about where we are in pricing and we are up almost a $100 for a policy in auto insurance premiums which is quite substantial, which gives us more flexibility to pursue the growth you are talking, but Matt can talk about that.","Matthew Winter","Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Matt. Let me follow on to Tom\u2019s comments. First, I think about this in three different components. First, the rate environment, the way I would describe it is that we have completed some of the work necessary to kind of catch up to that spike in auto frequency that we saw over the last 18 months and so you saw a fairly dramatic increase in rate taken in order to catch up quickly and try to get that to appropriate margins. And we believe with some exceptions in a few states, but in the vast majority of places we have not caught up and now we are in the mode of keeping up with emerging trends.","So, we don\u2019t know what this year will bring or next year, but we are now positioned very well in order to be able to react quickly and to keep up with trends as they emerge. Having caught up, it gives us a little freedom to do something that we were unable to do over the last couple of years. One of which is to begin adding agencies again and points of presence is extremely important for us to enable growth and that point of presence not only agencies but the licensed sales professionals and financial specialists that go along with them, it is hard to do when you are focused intentionally on taking rate and dealing with disruption that causes but now that we are in a slightly more stable environment.","We are able to focus on that strategic deployment once again. The second thing that we are hoping to do is to stem the retention losses and declines that we had growth, overall growth in items in four says you know there is a combination of new business growth and retention and it is a vicious treadmill if retention keeps declining since very hard to add enough new business to make up for that loss. We saw slight stabilization in the decline in this last quarter that makes sense to us since we took huge amount of rate in the second quarter of 2016 and so most of that has burned through already in customers and dealt with disruption already. To the extent we are able to keep more moderate rate increases at this point in time we believe customer disruption will be mitigated, will be able to hold on to more customers and I am in this business die.","The third component is the competitors environment and well we took fair amount of predecessors and we are questioning for reacting quickly about 18 months ago, I think that has been to our benefit I think most if not all of our competitors and recognized some increased frequency and many chases are reacting only recently from a rate taking perspective. That type of rate taking from our competitors create, shopping behavior in their customers and to the extend we are better positioned, we have increased agency capacity and our agents are ready willing enable to serve those customers, we should be in a very good position to pick up more of those customers from a new business perspective. So it is really a combination of all those items of improving retention, being in a position to capture more new business and hopefully in a more stable rate environment disrupting fewer customers.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great, thank you and then one last quick question.","Matthew Winter","Let's go to next question because we got like about 12 people on line here okay. We will come back to you if we have time.","Operator","Certainly, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please.","Greg Peters","Thank you for the call and taking my questions, I will keep it to two questions I guess. This is a follow up Matt; you were talking about agencies and points of presence. I was wondering if you could provide some demographics around your agencies, how many are closed to retirement and should we infer from your comments that you're as because your - you took pricing actions earlier than many of your peers, that your product and price decision should improve throughout 2017 and then I have a one follow up to that.","Matthew Winter","Okay Greg, well let me try - I don\u2019t have the actual agency demographics in front of me and I don\u2019t want to go based upon memory but I can tell you that we have over the last several years engaged in a different type of recruiting and selection process for agency owners, both in terms of geographic and in terms of demographic. I think as you know we have historical presence on the coast and that has served us well and we have been able to grow well there. We have not done as well in terms of strategic deployment and some of the heart land states in the lower premium stage and we have a concentrated effort to do that.","In terms of the people that we are bringing on, I would say that we've done an what I considered an excellent job of using data analytics and some of the projective tools available to us to better select people who will thrive in our new environment and we talk a little bit about our shift to trusted advisor mode but the type of agency owner and licensed sales professional that would have thrived maybe 10 or 15 years ago will not be the same type of person that we are looking to now because to drive in the next 10 to 15 years.","The trusted advisor model is much more relationship and advisory oriented, it is much more technology driven. It requires people who really want to get out there and use data analytics and technology themselves to serve customers to be able to really advise them about the risk that they take on in their lives and how to mitigate those risks. It requires somebody who is to more sophisticated about money management, so that they help our customers manage their cash flows as well as manage their risks. So the type of agency owner we were bringing on and licensed sales professional will bring you on - I feel very confident is one designed for the future and we had a decline in most of 2016.","We saw a pickup in the last quarter about 200 licensed sales professional and that is really key for us and when you look at our agencies, we will be shifting - we always had a focus on increasing the number of agencies because we believe physical points of presence are important, but agency capacity is just as important so the number of licensed sales professionals and their specialization, their ability to sell life and retirement, commercial insurance all of the different customer household lines, homeowners, their ability to specialize segment of licensed sales professionals so that they can really focus on serving customers is going to be key and so I think from a demographic perspective we are certainly creating a type of feel towards better way of serving customers in the future.","Greg Peters","Thank you. I guess the follow up question to all that, I just go back to the product positioning for 2017, in light of your comments about your early actions on price versus some of your peers, obviously the focus will be going forward for wall street, some of your investors will be growth and improvement in retentions, just to clean up on that, thank you very much for your answers.","Matthew Winter","Sure Greg, well first I am going to ask you to resist the natural tendency to think that growth is only a factor of price. Certainly rate and price competitors as a component but it is certainly not all of it and some of things I just talked about with trusting advisor, better serving our customers and better famous process and more focused advisory system, the ability to do enforced reviews and annual reviews on their holdings, that\u2019s all a piece of retention and that\u2019s all a part of growth. But you are correct shopping behavior is typically triggered by price changes and to the extend our competitors are now taking additional rate and fairly significant chunks because they are catching us as we were about 12 to 18 months ago. That will trigger if it is likely to trigger shopping behavior and their customers and if we have already gone through that and are stable I believe we will be better positioned to potentially add some of those customers and begin serving them as all state customers.","Greg Peters","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR, your question please.","Randy Binner","Hey, thank you. I just want to follow up on the response to Elyse\u2019s question on reserves and so I guess the way, I heard it was that favorable PYD [ph] was primarily from Auto BI over last three to four years and what do you think caused that is it a change in your claims approach that you have mentioned earlier? Is there some other aspect that caused that favorable development? It was notable and it is not really the pattern we've seen from others?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","While, I can't speak that what it means with respect to others. It is as you described mostly auto, it is really not a big percentage by the way total reserves and loss cost, when you look there is a normal variation in making the estimate when you are looking out anywhere from two to four years to get claims resolved strictly in BI which tend to stretch out three to four years. There is nothing unusual about we had reserve related much greater than that over time and so I don\u2019t think you should breath anything into it other than we conservatively estimate what we think are our last costs are and to the extend we wind those years up and not as much cash went out as we estimated and it shows that from P&L. ","Randy Binner","And then the other question is, I appreciate all the commentary about all said being kind of close to loss trend with all the initiatives you have done over last couple of years and that\u2019s clear, the numbers, what\u2019s your sense of what is actually happening out there form a kind of accident frequency perspective, meaning how are accidents still worse are we still seeing distracted driving impact, the frequency of accidents and I will leave there and I have one quick follow up.","Matthew Winter","Randy, it is Matt and I will try to answer that. There is loads of data out there about the correlation between miles driven and additional accident frequency but this is also that about increased deaths from increased fatalities, because the seriousness and [indiscernible] and we've talked about and I think we are seeing mounting evidence of the increased influence of distracted driving on that combination and the issue is this. People if we work constantly to that cell phones for many years and so actually cell phone use hasn\u2019t spike up that tremendously but in fact Smartphone ownership in U.S. has spiked up dramatically and when we look at Smartphone ownership statistics and Smartphone use and compare to accident frequency the correlation is great. So when you have increased miles driven due to increased economic driving, lowering gas prices so increase leisure driving.","Yeah, the increased number of drivers on the road that means lower margin for error because you used to have maybe 10 cars packed into the space and now you have 15 and so even if there was distraction before you had great reaction time before, now with increased density you don\u2019t have as greatest space to react in and so we are seeing increased accidents. We saw a spike in that, and that\u2019s what we have reacted to so when we say and I think the comment I made a few minutes ago is really important when you said there is a difference between saying things stabilize and saying things will revert to where they were before. We don\u2019t think accident frequency is reverting to where it was in 2012 or 2013 or 2014. What we are saying is the spike is over and it is now stabilized at a new norm and we think at least our belief is and our assumptions for all of our future work is that we are at that new norm and heightened accident frequency due to the greater economic activity, greater density of cars on the road and the greater use of Smartphone\u2019s and distracted driving in the car.","Randy Binner","And so then, if that is a new plateaus, it kind of penetration in these cases by the trial bar also at a new high that we should expect to continue?","Matthew Winter","I'm sorry, could you say that again?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","Trial bar.","Matthew Winter","Oh trial bar, so that\u2019s a - I think more of a severity question than a frequency question. Yeah, you have heard some of our competitors talk about combination of medical inflation and the trial bar influence on severity cost. I think to some extend we have seen, we've seen many of those same things but I would like to think we have been doing work on claims management, claims handling for the last several years as we saw those trends emerging. And that led to some of the work that we talked about - that influenced the BI frequency and the BI severity trends that you see that we reported on last quarter. I will remind you that we did have a process change and we talked about that last quarter.","We encouraged you then and I will encourage you now to look at the BI frequency and severity in combination because the claimant frequency had led to the increase in severity. We start really high and I will remind you that our number one commitment is always to take customers and claimants what we properly owe them. That being said there is claims management techniques to ferry out and eliminates fraud and wastage that don\u2019t compromise on that promise and that\u2019s what we have done. We began referring some enhanced documentation of entries and related medical treatment to ensure we were paying properly and that did change the mix of claims paid. In 2015, about 3rd of BI claims page were below the $1000, in 2016 that has dropped to about quarter leaving us with fewer but higher severity claims.","So that\u2019s what you see a change payment mix, it is still inline when you move all that around and you rationalize the two. We believe it is still in line with medical inflation, we are comfortable with our incurred loss transfer for BI and Steve said in his response to the reserving question. Don\u2019t confuse some of these operational claims statistics with profitability and reserving, when we are setting reserves, when that team is working on the reserves they know about the claims process enhancements, they take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves, they are doing very sophisticated segmented analysis and so while the claims process changes will influence those statistics you see on page severity and page frequency they are not influencing the reserves.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie, your question please.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. I'll make this quick, two questions, the first question goes back to I guess Elyse\u2019s question on the trends, when you talk about cashing up to the spike and also address miles driven, distracted driving, the distant fatalities, I am curious why shouldn\u2019t I be nervous that these trends will continue at an elevated levels and hence it is too early to start normalizing pricing, I mean we have just caught up to the past trend but it seems to all the indicators point to continued change in the slope of the loss cause trends?","Matthew Winter","Well thank you for that question, so it's Matt again. Look this is what we do, so I don\u2019t mean to be [indiscernible] about it, but we have really talented teams, people monitoring these trends on a stage and sub-geographies, sub-state level whose job is to watch net trends emerging and look at indications and ensure that we are keeping up with them as quickly as possible, consistent with actuarial standards so that you can file toward the rates and convince our state regulated to prove those rates. And this is what we have always done and we think we are well positioned to do it and in fact coming out of a spike like this one of the benefits is always that a benefit of going through something like this, it hyper focused us and those troubling segments of the business and allowed us to take segmented rates on those parts of the business so that we can improve our loss ratios as quickly as possible.","So, we believe that we have a high quality book at this point. We believe that we know the segments that we need to keep an eye on or we believe we\u2019ve gotten those headwinds rate adequate at this point. And so, we feel very comfortable with being able to manage some continued inflation and some continued rise in escalation in some of these costs. I will remind you that if we go through that, we will not be going through that alone. Our competitors will be going through the exact same thing and we think that we have an advantage with our skill in reacting quickly. We have an excellent relationship with the state regulators. Our teams have their respect. And so, when we do a filing, it\u2019s a complete thorough filing and we have an extremely high approval ratio and the ability to get rates into the book as quickly as needed.","Thomas Joseph Wilson","Amit, this time let me add. So, from our standpoint in pricing, it\u2019s only the now. It\u2019s like we look at what the frequency and severity is. We think - we look at it at that moment. It might be March, April, May, it might be August and whatever it is, we look at the previous [indiscernible]. And so we don\u2019t have a fixed assumption toward the year on frequency and severity that is used in pricing. As Matt\u2019s explaining it\u2019s very organic. So, when you are doing your models, of course, you are looking and saying what\u2019s the frequency and severity assumption looking forward and you have to put something in and then you have to put in something for price. We do that continuously by state, by some piece of the state every day.","And so, if frequency is 2 points higher, then we\u2019ll take 2 points more for rate. If it\u2019s 2 points lower, then we will decide whether we think that\u2019s reasonable or not. Unlikely we will lower our rates, but we may choose to invest more in expenses to begin to grow the business and that\u2019s why our range is what it is. With the 87, 89 range we\u2019re completely comfortable with. There is, as you know, obviously a 1 to 2 point variation if you add up frequency and severity over the course of the year. And so, - and to an extent, but we don\u2019t want you to think, so we lowered the range from where it was in 2016. This does not mean that we think you should take 2016 numbers and lower that by the same amount. That\u2019s just not the way we do it. It\u2019s not the way we run the business.","Amit Kumar","I guess I\u2019m just a glass half empty kind of guy. The other question I had, and switching topics here, the broader discussion on corporate taxation. If the taxes were to go down, does that get reflected in your pricing actions and I know it\u2019s a hypothetical or should we anticipate that netting down to your bottom line? Thanks.","John Griek","Taxes are, of course, complicated thing as it relates to Allstate. The first and probably the biggest impact is when it relates to taxes, that drives economic growth that\u2019s good for the company, because we\u2019re low on U.S. growth and that\u2019s our investment portfolio for the growth in auto and homeowners - auto ownership and home ownership. So, both of those could be very good for us.","As it relates to - you\u2019re at one component of it, if you look at our P&L, I\u2019ll go way up now and get back to pricing. We are a full taxpayer. We don\u2019t have - our industry does not have all kinds of special deductions. We think U.S. taxes should be based and corporations should pay based on what they use, not some centralized party control the economy. We know centralized timing doesn\u2019t work and using the tax provided by centralized plan and drive certain industries doesn\u2019t make sense to us.","As a result of that, there are a number of industries and companies that pay a lot less tax than us. We think it should be more relieving playing field and so we think our tax pay should be low. That would obviously immediately be good for our earnings, because we would have less cash. We have to pay out every year in taxes. What happens surprising then, it really depends on the individual state you\u2019re in, where you are in pricing that piece. I would make a couple of comments. One, I would reiterate what Matt said.","While price is important, we don\u2019t look at price as the only leverage of growth. We think price is what we have to charge relative to the value we provide that Matt is working hard on providing more value rather than just we\u2019ve achieved this in town and then it also depends - there is a variety of other facts, which would rattle through the pricing, the size shift the tax rate used in determining how return on capital and what happens to interest rate, what happens to inflation in that scenario, so there is a whole bunch of other, I would say, secondary and tertiary [indiscernible] pricing. Net, net, I believe a lower tax rate would be good for Allstate in short-term.","Amit Kumar","Thanks for the thorough answer and good luck for the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays, your question please.","Jay Gelb","Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was just on expectations for share buybacks in 2017. Should we be thinking about the 2016 page of 1.4 billion as a reasonable run rate?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","Well, Jay, it\u2019s Tom. So, I think you should think about - we still have $651 million yet to go, so you can put that in the bank that we fully expect to get it done by the time its authorization is up which is late in 2018 based on the pace we are going, it looks like it will be done sooner than the authorization. And then we look at where we are in terms of capital and we\u2019ll make the same judgment that we make every other year, which is between net and the dividend, how much cash can we return to shareholders, if we don\u2019t have a use for it, we\u2019ll return it. So, share repurchases will continue to be part of what we do, but we don\u2019t have a set number that we are ready to tee up because we still got ways to go on the existing share repurchase program.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then on the Allstate brand auto rate increases, I believe the expectation now is for those rating - the pace of rate increases to moderate in 2017. How much do you think that could slow?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","So, how much do you think the pace of rate increases in Allstate brand auto insurance could slow? It\u2019s on the extremely successful 75% you had this year. Sorry, Jay, I was just helping out.","Jay Gelb","With the editorial comment, thank you.","Matthew Winter","I wish I could tell you. I can only tell you that we\u2019ve done catching up as I stated earlier. So, when you are in catch-up mode, you are sprinting and you are taking as much as you can in order to get rate adequate and to clean up the booking and get to where you are earning in appropriate return on the business and it feels like in about probably three quarters of the states we will be reducing that level of rate we will not be taking the kind of rate we took in 2016. That being said, if we see additional pressure, we are going to take that.","So, I keep coming back to the same thing that both Tom and I have said during this call, we do have some assumptions about where loss costs are going to go next year, but they are just that. They are just assumptions and they are not a plan. Our plan is to keep up with loss costs as they emerge and take rate necessarily in order to do that. So, to the extent the reality meets our forecast and we have a stabilization of frequency trends and severity trends where they are now. I will expect us to see moderated rate need as we are keeping up with what is more normal inflationary trends at that point.","Jay Gelb","That makes perfect sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan, your question please.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. On the auto insurance margins, just to clarify, are you at your target auto margins on a GAAP basis now or is there still room to improve? And then the reason I ask is because the Allstate brand auto margin would have been 97%, the 2 points of favorable development.","Matthew Winter","Yeah, Sarah, thanks for the question. I was hoping Tom would have asked this so we would have asked it differently. - We still have room to improve, I think we feel really good about the progress we have made and we feel like we are earning under appropriate return on our investment at this point, but it is not our target return yet and we will continue to and that\u2019s makeable levers that\u2019s the claims management, that expense sufficiency that is additional rate, additional work on quality as a book, it is correct class work, it\u2019s underwriting work, all of the things that we did really, really strongly to get that to profitability, but all of those levers at the same levels as we need to continue to pull or just - now we can dial them instead of pulling them really hard, we can dial them carefully and thoughtfully to get that targeted returns but a lot closer than we have been for a while to where we wanted to be but our work is not over.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay great thanks. And then just on the auto severity, I apologies if I you addressed it but the defect in using, I sense you encouragements are consistent but we heard one of your competitors saying you are seeing much higher severity from more occupants for vehicle, more fatalities, higher legal cost, sounds like you acknowledged some of those but it doesn\u2019t seem like you are seeing any of this in your encouragement and you just clarify that.","Steve Shebik","I think you are over reading into what we said about, there are normal inflationary cost embedded in our BI. So I'm not - other people there might they are saying they got lots of stuff in its driving, ours just is normal like and we incur it that way. We show you page, but that\u2019s not the way - we used space to help and think about how we reserve but it is not the way we are trying to P&L. We are trying to P&L on what we think is going to happen using it is normal and it may answered you question on the slight of the longer perspective on the combined ratio so we had great returns in the auto insurance business group, twelve plus year, we showed that the market was going to give us the economic rent based on the value we provided and then in 2015, we had a huge spike in frequency in severity and as Matt said we don\u2019t like, we like to always turn better and so we had to move quickly, our team did, they executed well and we moved those returns up.","Are we back to the return we had for that period of time like, no but are we fundamentally different position today, where we feel like what we should be thinking about how we get there or what period time we get there and then whether we can and that\u2019s the process, that\u2019s Allstate brand. Esurance is a slightly different position, it's had a good movement throughout the year picked up mostly in the first half of the year, we are watching the fourth quarter because it bumped up a little bit and if its frequency and severity trends increase, it does the same think that Matt described, it is now, that\u2019s whatever happens. We feel like we have had some good success this year as one of you pointed out, we finally managed to get some underwriting income out of that business and we are happy that now position well and so we got - it is in the same place. We are feeling good about the process and the way the machine works here, they help us manage whatever comes our way and that\u2019s what you are buying. You are buying the machine, not somebody's projection and frequency and severity.","Sarah DeWitt","Great thank you.","Steve Shebik","Okay maybe we'll take one last question and then we will close.","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney, your question please.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thanks for squeezing me in Tom, two quickies, on square trade increased disclosure, turning more color on what the goodwill going to be and second to be excluded out of Esurance or included in per earnings?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","We just bought it as you know Bob, last month, we don\u2019t have any update on numbers. We are obviously working hard at - coming up with what\u2019s the split between goodwill and intangibles are. I missed your second question.","Bob Glasspiegel","Is it going to be included or excluded in core earnings, the good will piece?","Thomas Joseph Wilson","The good will, only intangibles are amortized and they are excluded from operating income, that\u2019s definition of operating income.","Bob Glasspiegel","Got you, one another quickie, the life earnings were up by more than sort of the partnership delta, Mary Jane was there anything unusual or recurring in that bump up in the earnings level in the quarter?","Mary Jane Fortin","So profit financial Bob, really for the annuities, we had the benefit of the format based investments that Steve alluded to that was at 13.8%, we also didn\u2019t have favorable mortality as well in both the annuity business and the life business. So we did have a favorable quarter from a mortality perspective impacting our result.","Thomas Joseph Wilson","That\u2019s what she was saying [indiscernible].","Bob Glasspiegel","No, I knew the plump up in partnership income was not recurring but it was more than that, it was 20 million to 30 million more than just increase in partnerships, but mortality could explain some of that, thanks.","Mary Jane Fortin","Yeah, most of it was the partnership recurring Bob, the mortality was worked about fixed after tax on the annuity.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay, I will go through it with John, appreciate it.","Mary Jane Fortin","Yeah, okay.","Thomas Joseph Wilson","Let\u2019s do that. Thank you all for participating if you go to slide 13, there is good reasons as to why this is good investment, why it should continue to hold Allstate, we are positioned with profitable growth and we know how to move in our market place well and we are building long-term growth platforms along the way as well. Thanks so much, we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the slides we'll use this morning. we also posted a document describing our 2015 country-wide, excluding Florida, reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. We are recording the call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Wilson","Good morning, thank you for investing your time with us. I'll begin with an overview of our results on Slide 2. Then Pat and Steve will go through the results in detail.","Also here to engage with you are Matt Winter, Allstate's President, also the leader of our Allstate branded operations; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business in Encompass; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","So let me begin, with the strength of our strategy is really evident in this quarter's results. We have a broad-based business model that serves a wide range of customers with a broad range of products.","What that does is it enables us to generate profitable growth, despite a changing economic and competitive environment. Our results reflect progress on all 5 operating priorities for 2015, which are to grow, while maintaining the underlying combined ratio, practically manage the $80 billion investment portfolio and invest for sustainable value creation. Our position in multiple customer segments, insurance products, geographies and investments enables us to continue meeting our short and long-term commitment to shareholders, our customers, our agency owners and employees as well as local communities.","If you turn to Slide 3, you can see the financial outcomes of our performance in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to build growth momentum by adding 875,000 policies over the last 12 months, and now reaching $34.4 million. When combined with price increases, this resulted in net written premium growth of 4.8%, the benefit of a segmented approach to the market was evident as growth continued to accelerate in the Allstate brand, which gave us room to slow growth in the Esurance and Encompass businesses, given our economic targets for those 2 businesses. The recorded combined ratio was 93.7, which was better than last year. This decline reflected lower catastrophes, which also shows the benefit of having a diversified product portfolio, as an uptick in the Allstate brand auto combined ratio to 96.8 in the first quarter, was offset by an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 78.7.","Esurance and Encompass; they're still making progress on improving value creation and the results still need to improve.","When you take out the volatility associated with catastrophes and reserve changes, you can see that the underlying combined ratio deteriorated slightly, but within the full year range of 87 to 89. This level of profitability does include expenses, which build long-term value, such as growing Esurance and investing in long-term growth platforms, and I'll talk about that in just a minute.","Investment results were good when adjusted for the reduction of asset due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in the second quarter of last year. Our proactive approach to investing to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, not just operating income continue to benefit our overall results and we had strong results from limited partnerships, which offset the impact of reducing interest rate risk in the fixed income portfolio.","We also had really good results from a more focused but smaller Allstate Financial. Total net income was $648 million in the quarter, $1.53 a share as you can see in the box at the top of that slide. Operating income was $1.46 per share, which was 12.3% higher than the same quarter last year, which reflected both higher income and fewer shares outstanding.","The first quarter Property-Liability results for each customer segment are shown on Slide 4. I'm just going to comment on the circled numbers in each segment, starting with the Allstate brands in the lower left, which serves, of course, customers that prefer local advice in a branded offering. Policy In Force growth accelerated across all products as Matt's team pursues a comprehensive and fully integrated growth plan. The underlying combined ratio for this business, which represents 90% of our total premiums written was 87.4 in the quarter.","Esurance in the lower right focuses on customers who prefer a self-serve approach, but want a branded offering. Policy growth slowed to 8.9%. The underlying combined ratio of $116.5 million included advertising expenses, which are being made to grow share and the costs associated with expanding the product offering and the geographic reach. As a result, we look at the underlying loss ratio, which was 78.2 in the first quarter, which still needs to be lowered.","Moving to the customer segment that prefers local advice but is brand neutral, which is in the upper left, that's the segment that we serve with our Encompass business. This business got marginally smaller in first quarter as we seek to improve profitability.","So as a management team, we're committed to both delivering these current results as well as investing in sustainable value creation as shown on Slide 5.","While these items on this page all had a negative impact on current quarterly earnings, they are an important driver to shareholder value. So therefore, we're completely committed to them. We made good progress in modernizing our operating model. We also continued laying the foundation to reducing low value added activities handled by Allstate Agencies, while increasing their ability to provide trusted advice to customers.","Since acquiring Esurance in 2011, we've grown market share by repositioning the brand, expanding its geographic footprint and its product offerings, and supporting this with advertising investments that are higher than justified by current premium levels.","We continue to invest in share growth as long as lifetime returns on new customers exceed our cost to capital. We are also seizing the opportunity that comes with connecting customers to telephony by expanding our telematics offering. We now have over 0.75 million customers using Drivewise and DriveSense. We are also innovating our roadside service operating model, which has over 3 million members in the -- under the Allstate brand and many millions more under our weight [ph] label offerings. So in summary, our goal is to both deliver today and build for tomorrow.","And now let me turn it over to Pat to go through the Property-Liability results in more detail.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing our Property-Liability results on Slide 6.","Starting with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability had earned premium of $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, 5.1% higher than the first quarter of 2014. Recorded combined ratio of 93.7 was a 1.0 lower than the prior year quarter driven by catastrophe losses of $294 million, which were 33.9% lower than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 89 was 6\/10 of a point higher than the first quarter of 2014.","Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 14.7% from the first quarter of 2014, due primarily to strong limited partnership returns in the quarter. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter was $555 million, 18.6% higher than the first quarter of 2014.","The Chart on the lower left shows Net Written Premiums and Policy In Force growth rates for Allstate Protection. The red line representing Policy In Force growth shows the continued positive policy growth trend that is being driven by the Allstate brand. Policies In Force grew by 875,000 or 2.6% from the first quarter of 2014.","The Allstate brand accounted for 86% of policy growth in the first quarter of 2015, based on the strength of Auto, Homeowners and Other personal lines.","Total premium grew 4.8% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, reflecting the combination of policy and average premium increases.","Exhibits to the right of this chart displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. You can see the recorded first quarter combined ratio was lower than the historical first quarter average and below the first quarter of 2014, due to lower catastrophe losses.","Total underlying combined ratio of 89 was more in line with the historical trend and was impacted by higher auto losses in the first quarter of 2015 versus the prior year quarter.","Page 7 highlights Allstate brand Auto growth and margin trends. Growth trends are highlighted in the top or in the chart on the top. Policies increased by 623,000 in the first quarter of 2015 or 3.2% higher than the first quarter of 2014, driven by continued broad-based increase in new business and stable retention trends. Auto items In Force grew in 42 states in the first quarter of 2015.","Net written premium grew 5.7% as average premiums increased by 2.3% over the prior year quarter.","The chart on the lower left shows the past 3 years' quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. The recorded combined ratio was 96.8 in the first quarter of 2015, 3.4 points worse than the first quarter of 2014, and the underlying combined ratio was 95.6 in the first quarter, 1.8 points higher than the prior year quarter. Further details are shown in the chart on the bottom right.","Annualized the average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continue to increase over the prior year in the first quarter. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy, shown by the red line, increased 4.1% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2014 and was impacted by 3 separate drivers.","First, Allstate brand prior year auto reserve re-estimates were unfavorable. About half of the impact is due to litigation settlement accruals on older cases, while the rest is driven by variations in reserving. Second, bodily injury frequency increased 6.8% compared with the first quarter of last year. The increase is explained partially by comparisons to a very favorable quarter of BI frequency in the first quarter of 2014. But it also reflects higher frequency experience across our book of business.","Third, property damage frequency increased 2.1% in the first quarter compared with the prior year quarter. This increase is due in part to adverse winter weather in the eastern part of the country. But again, we're also seeing higher PD frequency this year than we did for most of last year. You may recall that we did experience elevated property damage frequency in last year's first quarter due to widespread winter weather, when we look at bulk coverages over a multiyear period the trends across as BI and PD are very consistent.","As you'd expect, we've continued to dig into the drivers of increased frequency since the trends began to emerge in the fourth quarter of last year. Leverage our data and analytic capabilities to continuously analyze our business from the macro level down to the micro segments that our local teams used to underwrite in price.","Some examples of items we've been investigated include the impact of new to renewal loss ratio relativities, often referred to as the new business penalty form writing higher volumes in new business, state mix and geographic mix within states, higher growth books of business versus stable or moderately growing books, monoline versus multiline, liability only versus full coverage, and quality characteristics such as insurance score, driver age and household composition.","Based on our analysis, we continue to be comfortable with the quality of both our new and renewal business.","This analysis also reinforces our conclusion that recent frequency fluctuations are due primarily to macroeconomic trends in weather. And that while we believe industry-wide auto frequency will continue its long-term downward slope overtime, there will be periods of variability within that trend that are driven by external factors.","Our regional teams have been quick to identify these developing trends on a local market basis and have taken and will continue to take appropriate underwriting and pricing actions to achieve our targeted returns.","Given current trends, we expect the level of underwriting changes and rate increases to accelerate. Improved rate increases in April of 2015 exceed that of the entire first quarter of 2015. The result of our regional teams adjusting the timing and the amount of rates that were already planned in the year.","We do not believe these actions to maintain margins will materially impair current policy growth trends.","Moving to page 8. Let's discuss Allstate brand homeowners. Growing homeowners in parts of the country that are adequately priced and have acceptable exposure to catastrophes. Policy growth is being driven by both increased new business and improved retention.","The chart on the bottom left shows the continued strength of homeowner profitability and the earnings benefit we experienced in the first quarter of 2015 from having a diversified product portfolio.","Recorded combined ratio was 78.7 for the first quarter of 2015 and the underlying combined ratio of 64.5 improved by 1.3 points from the first quarter of 2014","Moving to the lower left, annualized average premiums shown in blue continues to improve the slowing rate versus the recent history, reflecting improved returns. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy were essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Non-catastrophe frequency in the first quarter of 2015 was 7.9 points below the prior year quarter, and the 6.6% increase experienced in paid severity was due to the claim count mix. Individual homeowners severity parallels are performing within expected ranges.","Page 9 provides an overview of growth and profit results for Esurance and Encompass. Starting on the upper left of the slide, Esurance's rated policy and total network and premium growth continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitable growth as well as the increasing size of the business.","Total Esurance premiums grew by 8.9% in the first quarter, policies in force grew 8.6% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Esurance profitability shown in the upper right chart was impacted by higher claim frequency and higher severity on collision and property damage. Esurance's expense ratio decreased 10.7 points in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the prior year quarter, given last year's first quarter spend to reposition the brand.","Spending on expansion initiatives, contributed approximately 2.8 points to the Esurance's expense ratio in the first quarter compared with 2 points in the first quarter of 2014.","Encompass policy in force growth, illustrated by the gray line in the chart on the bottom left, fell to negative 2\/10 due to lower new business and lower retentions, the result of ongoing profit improvement actions. Decline in policies also impacted net written premiums which is 1.4% lower in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the first quarter of 2014.","Encompass' first quarter recorded combined ratio of 95.6 improved by 7 points, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses.","And now I'll turn it over to Steve to cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Pat. Slide 10 provides an overview of Allstate Financial. As we've discussed previously, we strategically repositioned Allstate Financial over the last several years to focus its business on Allstate brand customers. The most recent action was to sell Lincoln Benefit Life and further integrate the life business into the Allstate brand value proposition.","Allstate Financial results for the first quarter are highlighted in the bottom of the slide. Premiums and contract charges increased 2.9% when compared to first quarter of 2014 results, excluding LBL. Growth was driven primarily by increased additional life insurance renewal premiums, Allstate benefit accident and health insurance business.","Allstate Benefits now has 3.2 million policies in force, making it a major player in the voluntary workplace benefits business.","Operating income for the first quarter was $134 million, 13.5% lower than the first quarter of 2014 after adjusting for the disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life. This reduction in operating income was driven primarily by lower investment income related to prepayment fees and litigation settlements, and higher life mortality and expenses than the prior year first quarter.","Moving to investments in the chart at the top of the Slide 11. Our portfolio total return was 1.7% for the first quarter. The components of the total return continue to show that the income yield remains consistent while the valuation impact varies from quarter-to-quarter.","Most recently, being driven by reductions in interest rates since year end 2014.","Our portfolio valuations have not been materially impacted by lower energy prices as the majority of our assets with exposure to the energy sector are investment-grade corporate bonds, which are currently in an unrealized gain position. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income in yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios.","The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield in the lower left graph reflects the impact of prior duration shortening and ongoing investments in a low interest-rate environment. The interest-bearing portfolios yield is close to current market yields and is expected to respond more quickly to changes in interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile.","Moving to the Allstate Financial portfolio in the lower right. The interest-bearing portfolio yield is higher and more stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and its cash flows being used largely to fund annuity reductions.","The drop in investment income primarily reflects the LBL disposition and the aforementioned reduction in annuities. Total first quarter limited partnership income was 39% higher than the same period last year, helped by a strong quarter for our real estate investments. Economic conditions and high liquidity levels have contributed to favorable market performance, which is reflected in strong limited partnership results in both portfolios.","As you can see from the charts, limited partnerships and other equity investments bring a higher degree of variability to our income, while more volatile, we expect these investments to increase returns in both portfolios over the long-term.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our strong capital position and excellent shareholder returns at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through a combination of common dividends and share repurchases. We completed our 2014, 2.5 billion common share repurchase authorization in February by initiating new $3 billion authorization. A $500 million accelerate repurchase program was executed in March, which should be completed by mid-June.","As of March 31, we had $2.4 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by July 2016. We provide additional information on our share repurchase activities this quarter in the chart on the right. In the table under the chart, you can see the impact of accelerated share repurchase initiations and settlements for each of the past 9 quarters. We have also posted an explanatory document on ASRs our Investor Relations website this morning.","Yesterday afternoon, we communicate the details of our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program, excluding Florida. We rolled our expiring nationwide contract in a similar to lower-cost agreements and added approximately $300 million of coverage for growth in our business. As in prior years, I challenged our team to push the envelope a bit. You will see this year's program race through the historic 3-year duration of traditional reinsurance with 2 7-year 2 limit multi-pillar reinsurance covers to provide further stability in our business for our customers.","We expect to place our Florida program in the second quarter. And we'll communicate details at that time. Now let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I wanted to start off with a question about growth. You guys have nicely increased your production coming from the core agency channel over the past few years. And there's a bunch of different things that have been going on, you talked about new younger agents coming into sort of freshen the footprint, also invest in developing agency management strategies and in cross-selling. And now you're talking a bit about the sort of evolving the -- how you run agencies, to focus more on higher value-added advisory relationships. And I was kind of trying to figure out -- map, I was trying to go through an exercise in my mind of mapping the improving production that you're actually seeing with some of the things you've been trying to do. And I was curious if you could help us sort of walk through, is this your initiatives playing out? Or is this more a function of your willingness now to write more homeowners and basically, having gone through a period of reunderwriting and now kind of having easy comps?","Thomas J. Wilson","Good morning, Josh. Thank you for the question. Matt will take you through some of the specifics. It's a good question because it really gets to the substance of that, which we are doing which is our strategy is comprehensive, but it's designed to support profitable growth in any environment. And oftentimes, we might get into an environment where costs are going up and we have to raise prices, everybody thinks that it's all about price. And it is currently price is very -- obviously, very important, but Matt has a much more comprehensive program than that.","Matthew E. Winter","Good morning, Josh, and thanks for the question. As you correctly pointed out, we have seen some nice growth overall in the business, both on the auto and the homeowners side.","We've also seen growth in the consumer household goods, and we're beginning to see some growth in the life and retirement space as well.","We don't believe that it's any one particular item that's led to that. As Tom mentioned, we really -- the entire team views this as one complex system, and we try to pull multiple levers on that system and have multiple influences on it that feed off of each other, as most self-generating systems do.","So what we're doing now is a function of trying to improve -- we use the phrase bandwidth and efficiency -- so we're trying to lay more pipe and improve the efficiency and productivity of that pipe. So we're adding a lot of agencies and we're adding agencies in a strategic manner. Not just allowing them to grow and develop wherever they want, but to thoughtfully pick geographic areas that have been underpenetrated in the past, and attempt to recruit in a more targeted way.","So that would include some areas that, historically, we've shied away from; some of the more non-urban areas, some of the heartland, the middle of the United States, some of the rural areas. And we're approaching that in a fairly thoughtful way using a bunch of different tools, including our regular agency system. But we're also using our Allstate auto dealer program, which enables us to put Allstate Agencies inside of auto dealerships. We're also using selective independent agency expansion in some of those rural areas to maximize our points of presence around the United States.","And then, we're doing a tremendous amount of work to improve the productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of those agents once they are there.","And that includes some of the Trusted Advisor work you referred to, where we're trying to take away some of the low value-added work that distracts them, doesn't add value to the customer and just eats up agency time. We're trying to use data analytics, emerging technologies as well as centralized support services to pull those out of the agencies, free them up for more value-added advice, consultation and service on coverage options; and enable them to really do what we think that we have as our competitive advantage, which is to have a local advisor in the community, who actually knows about those customers, can counsel them appropriately, and form a relationship-based business, not just a transactionally based business.","The last thing I'll point out on our growth is that while Tom said, and correctly, it's not all about price, it is to some extent driven by our competitiveness and the way we approach the market. And that's not just agent behavior, that's not just our points of presence, but that includes the rest of the system, that includes our marketing effectiveness, our lead generation capabilities, our ability to offer all the products those customers need; not turning any customers away and letting them go to other companies for one of those products. So that's where the homeowners -- opening up homeowners and expanding our product portfolio, and including life and retirement comes in. It allows us to serve the customers holistically, say yes to more customers, and not turn many away. It's where our new rating plans, which provide a -- through broadening the target -- allow us to offer a more competitive price to a broader group of customers coming in.","So I would say that the growth that we've achieved is a product of all of those factors, not any one in particular, not any one in isolation. It's one of the reasons that we feel confident that this sustainable growth and will continue, because it's not based upon one lever, it's based upon the system really functioning very effectively as a system.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's great, Matt. Maybe just a quick question on margin expansion in Encompass and Esurance. I'm wondering if you guys could talk and give us a little bit more sort of the color, the back stories sort of what's creating the opportunities here? And then, help us understand to sort of, to what long-term sort of goals you're trying to drive these 2 businesses to? I mean, when you look at public comps, people make more money and attract business if you're larger and more mature and people make more money at a high net worth business than you do. And I'm wondering if you could long-term drive for these 2 franchises to have profitability to be in line with the core Allstate channel?","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me make an overview comment, then Don and Kathy can say. I would say what gives the opportunity as you appropriately classified it, is that it's not good enough. So we have some work to do there.","The -- but they're different stories, right. So Esurance, we would like to continue to pick up share in that segment. So we continue to invest ahead of where other competitors would invest in terms of advertising as a percentage of revenues. We could obviously make that business profitable by shutting down advertising and growth and we're choosing not to do that because we want to grow in that segment.","The Encompass segment is a different story. It's much more competitive because you're inside the agency. So you have to be more careful as to how you grow there and so it's different set of stories. We're not explicitly seeking to invest in growing share [indiscernible] we're investing to get profitable growth.","So Don and Kathy, maybe you can give a quick answer to those 2.","Don Civgin","Yes, Josh. As far as the insurance goes, I think we've been very consistent since we put the company together, that our goal is to run the business in a way that's economically attractive over the lifetime value of the business we're writing. That then tends to take out this accounting anomaly of the advertising, which because of the direct model gets expensed immediately in the quarter it's spent, even though it's designed to build value over the lifetime.","So when you look at that equation of running the business on economic value, I think you have to breakout loss ratio and I'll say advertising expense separately. On the loss ratio, we still have room to grow. That's what I said last quarter too, we saw similar trends to the Allstate brand in the first quarter. And so we are also accelerating rate increases and taking underwriting actions and there is a need to improve the loss ratio in the Esurance brand over the course of this year.","On the advertising side, it's a little bit more complicated. As Pat pointed out in his opening comments, there tends to be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Part of it is cyclicality, but part of it is what we're trying to accomplish. so last year in the first quarter, we spent a lot of advertising dollars because we were repositioning the brand. This year, we spent less. That you see in the expense ratio going down a little over 10 points. We still ran the awareness ads in the Super Bowl, in fact, we ran 2 of them but we didn't heavy up afterwards, like we did last year because of repositioning.","So when we talk about running at -- running Esurance on an economic value basis that includes advertising. So on a year-over-year basis, we continue to look at what the right amount is to make sure that the business we're writing is profitable. But you'll continue to see some variation from quarter-to-quarter.","Katherine A. Mabe","Josh, this is Kathy Mabe. Thanks for the question on Encompass. You can see from the investor supplement that we're starting really lean into rates, you can see it on Page 13. But keep in mind, a lot of our rate actions come -- will come midyear and in fourth quarter for Encompass. Part of what you're seeing, I think the best way to tell the stories on Page 18 of the investor supplement. And you can see that we made progress on the underlying combined ratio by about a point, but there is a lot more work to do.","From a policies in force perspective, we're about flat with where we were a year ago. And what's driving the net written premium change, is the change in mix, as we really put strong action in a couple of highly unprofitable states, which have high average premiums, and redirect growth to more profitable states, which have lower average premiums. These actions combined will allow us to position Encompass for long-term success. So we're not looking at just short term measures, but how do we reposition -- as Matt talked about -- reposition the channel for long-term profitable growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I remain pretty confident that you guys know what you're doing on pricing, and will keep the margins within your targeted level on auto. I'm less confident that you could continue to grow PIF at the current rate. In fact, you said, I think in your script that you don't think the PIF growth will be materially negatively impacted. Where are we in the environment on pricing at Geico's commentary in Q1. I think it's helpful they're are going to be taking rate actions. Do you feel like you're with the field at the rate actions you're taking? Or maybe pushing ahead little bit and may lose some PIF momentum?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, I think in terms of your level of confidence and the level of our confidence, the first thing you have to get through is this our problem or is this everybody's problem? If it's our problem, then obviously, the actions we take will be different and the impact on shareholder value and long-term value creation is different then it's everybody's problem. If it's everybody's problem, then the actions we take and the impact on both growth profitability, customer satisfaction, ability to expand agencies is completely different.","So we feel like this is, at this point, everybody's problem. Matt can help you understand why we believe that's the case. And if you look at the relative amount of increases necessary to account for increased cost of auto insurance, and that's all that we're talking about in this particular case is auto insurance, not the broad portfolio we have.","If you're just talking about auto insurance, it's relatively small dollars when it comes to amount per customer per year.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. Bob, it's Matt. Let me expand a little bit on what Tom just said. As we talked about last quarter actually, the frequency pressure is a combination of miles driven and weather. And I believe I said, last quarter, we thought that miles driven was about 3x as influential as the weather, that pattern seems [indiscernible] pulled up again, this quarter. But we want to validate that and verify it and as Pat referred to in his opening remarks, we did a very intense deep dive into our business to ensure that the increases in the frequency we're seeing are proportional and consistent across multiple segments of the business, no matter how you cut it. To make sure, in effect, that these aren't our problems, but are, in fact, external.","And so we looked at new and renewal business, we looked higher growth states versus lower growth states. We looked across quality characteristics. We looked across driver age, household composition, insurance scores, full coverage versus liability, across different rating plans to see whether or not perhaps, the rating plans had influenced it. And all of that review has showed that this trend is externally driven, primarily by miles driven.","And then we wanted to validate that. And so we've looked at external data on miles driven. And miles driven February year-to-date was 3.9% above prior year. The 12-month moving average on miles driven is 2.8% above the 5-year average. So we see it from external data. And then we're fortunate because we keep our Drivewise device in the car for an extended period of time. We're able to look at that data on an ongoing basis. And so we have our own specific proprietary data that shows miles driven up a consistent amount to what we see in external data sources. So we validated it with our internal data, we validated it with external data. And then, we looked at other sources to ensure that, that in fact, is true.","And I switched my reading material. If you look at CollisionWeek Magazine, that periodical, it reported January production for the auto body repair industry was 6.8% higher than January of 2014.","That's a huge increase for increased activity in body shop. So we looked at that and then we looked on the weather side. And for those of you in the Northeast, you experienced most of this. You experienced winter storm, Juno. You saw the coldest February ever recorded in Connecticut and Upstate New York. You saw the second coldest February on record in New York. You saw 200 car pileups in Michigan in January, one of the largest on record.","And so we saw precipitation increases and freeze increases in the first quarter that were pretty much unprecedented. So you look at all of that and you come to the conclusion that in fact, this is an external trend. So given that it's an external trend, we believe that our competitors will react to it the same way we will react to it.","I don't think they will react to it with a level of sophistication and granularity, we might, or in the exact same ways, but they will have to react to the trends. As I mentioned in my earlier response, competitiveness is not just rate. But if you do look at rate, we saw the auto insurance CPI up 5.9% for March. 5.9% up from February CPI of 5.6% and the 2014 full year auto insurance CPI of 4.2%. So the average premiums paid by customers has been steadily increasing. Then we look at [ph] and we look at competitor rate increases and we believe we're going to be part of the path taken by rates. So as a result, it's going to come down to execution and not just execution on how we take rate and how carefully we do it, but how we execute on the rest of the system, all those other factors; trusted advise from agents, service, product design, excellent claim service, effectiveness of our advertising, the productivity and efficiency in the agencies, their ability to close the business quickly and we feel confident. I feel very confident that the team will manage through this. I like this kind of competition. I think we are very well-suited to deal with it effectively and rise to the top of it. So it does not concern us.","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, let me add something on top of that. First, it's not one product and it's not one market. So -- because we have a couple of competitors where you can see their results and they are one-product companies, we end up tending to focus on just auto.","We have a broad-based growth plan as Matt talked about earlier. And so I just want to double-underline what he said earlier, which is broad-based. Secondly, it's not just one market, like, because we report the numbers on a countrywide basis, we tend to have that conversation there, but that's not the way the business has been run.","So there are many markets. So if you look at the top 11 states, 6 of them are growing at higher than 3%, but that also means that 5 are growing at less than 3%, in fact, 4 of them are kind of hovering around 0, I think, Matt. So you're -- we don't have to react. We don't react across the country, we react to every local market. And so the results you see, reflect what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And they will reflect the way we go forward in the future.","Operator","Our next lesson comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And to just follow up on Bob's question. Just in terms of the action plan you're taking on pricing side to mitigate some of the impact of rising loss cost trend, I'm wondering when you -- like how much price increase you need to have? And in that price increase, like, do you forecast any further rising in terms of the mileage driven? And also, like in terms of time, how soon can you get pricing into the system and stay [indiscernible] on the others? And then, like I just wonder, going -- are we going to see continued high level, like combined ratio than you desired over the next few quarter as you are taking these pricing actions?","Matthew E. Winter","Thanks, Kai, for the question. It's Matt, again. So I think as we pointed out in the Q, I'm sorry, in the Investors sup on Page 13, footnote 9, April rates actually exceeded that of the entire first quarter. So it does take us a while to begin to implement the rate increases. It's a process. We have to recognize the trend, we have to do the filing. We have to do a careful thoughtful approach to it, to make sure we minimize the potential impact on growth and retention. And then, we institute as quickly as possible. So this quarter showed a fairly low-level of filed and approved rates. It doesn't mean it showed us a low-level of activity, because you can't see the activity. And you -- that's one of the reasons we point out the April rate. I would say that we are accelerating some of the rate that had been planned for the rest of the year. But overall, the levels are not something that I think will shock the system. Where rate is not our only lever on managing loss cost. We look at things like our underwriting guidelines. We have correct class programs to make sure we're getting paid the appropriate price for the risk that we're taking on. And so -- and we have expenses.","And we will continue to manage all those levers to ensure our combined ratio stays within an appropriate range, so that we earn an appropriate return on the business. I can't predict where miles driven are going to go or where weather is going to go, or what the unemployment rates are going to look like over the next several months or year. I can say that we have a very good handle on the trend. We have a system that's designed just for this in mind, because it's a decentralized rate taking system that looks at each individual geography and manages rate taking by that local geography. And so we're on it, and we will continue to preserve margins.","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me make sure you really focused on it. There was a statement Matt made in there, which I want to make sure you're really focused on, which is from a shareholder value standpoint, our auto business generates really good returns, both over time and even this quarter. Okay, so 96.8 was higher than we would have liked in the quarter. But if you look over the last 12 months, its 95.6. That's a recorded number, that's not an underline, that's not anything. That is a really good return on auto insurance.","And so we wanted to make sure we continue to earn that return for our customers -- give that product to our customers at the right price so we earn a good return for our shareholders. And we don't feel like we're in a position where we have to react expeditiously because there is something that is our problem.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's very comprehensive. My follow-up is on your reinsurance strategy. Looks like you maintained your, like, retention of $500 million. I just wonder, like, 2 directions on your reinsurance, given the reinsurance environments. But now the pricing is affordable and you have longer-term horizon that 7-year contract now. So on one hand, is that -- what's your strategy to further lower your volatility, basically even reducing your current retention level? And the other direction is really, what about the coastal market? If you can afford to buy long-term affordable reinsurance will you be more interesting expanding into this markets?","Steven E. Shebik","So I'll address that in -- this is Steve. I'll just address it in a couple of ways. As you noticed, we effectively placed the same program we did last year, $500 million retention, the nationwide coverage: We kind of rolled over the expiring contracts. We brought $300 million more of coverage as our business is growing.","And as you noted, 2 of the contracts above the nationwide program, we placed for 7 years in additional reinsurance market. So that was a major breakthrough we think in terms of our coverage. You heard me talk in the past about we need 7- to 10-year coverage to provide a stability in the business for our customers. So that we thought was a big breakthrough this year by our team.","In terms of buying below, making that $500 million less. We look at that and given our capital base, we don't think we need to do that. We're in the business to make good returns, we are making good returns in that business now.","And we don't think that economically it makes sense to really bring that down much further. In terms of the coastal business, Matt's talked, off and on, about the optimization of our exposure on the coast. We continue to work on that in terms of agency placements. In addition, to just getting reinsurance, we want to have the people in place, we want to have a spread of risk, not only the coast, but the central part of the country; which provides the most optimal reinsurance buy and the optimal economics for the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the reinsurance program. A part of it goes out 7 years, does that have positive implications for capital or is that layer just too small?","Steven E. Shebik","The implication -- this is Steve, again. The implication is, it's -- we have buy at a high enough level to appropriately meet the capital tests that the rating agencies have. The 7 years is really for us because it provides stability in our capital base and for our customers.","Thomas J. Wilson","And this would be Tom. We're way underrated in anyway, so...sorry, I couldn't help myself.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Another quick follow-up for Steve, just on the reinsurance program. Could you guys give us a dollar amount or even just, directionally, what you expect to save on your reinsurance program over the next 12 months?","Steven E. Shebik","So if you look at the -- what we placed in the rollover of our nationwide program, it's 1\/3 of our program, and market pricing today is 10%, 12% better than it was a year ago. We reinvested a good part of that in buying this other $300 million of coverage at the top. So you shouldn't see a whole lot of savings. If you remember, most of it actually just goes through our rates, a little bit delayed basis.","But more than 80% of our reinsurance cost are baked into the rates. So if the reinsurance cost go up, the rates go up as they go down and as they have the last handful of years, our rates actually go down.","Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess just shifting gears to Allstate brand, just a little more color on the 8\/10 of a point of unfavorable reserve development in the auto. It sounded like about half is ascribe to litigation settlement accruals. I know that segment, it has been that redundant for a while. I think, because of the severity related reserve releases. Just curious what drove the rest of the noise there?","Steven E. Shebik","So let me do it -- look at it in a couple of ways. First, our reserves are appropriately stated in the balance sheet.","And we -- they are subject to multiple internal and external use on a regular basis. I just want to make sure we get that out of the way. Second, we do stay that way, because we use a variety of reserving methods and they react quickly to the underlying changes in the data we see.","So on the first point, to reiterate that just slightly, the reserves are established by a team under Sam Pilch our controller and under myself. That is separate from our business units. So we have independence in terms of within the company and they are independently evaluated by both our auditors and an annual basis by our appointed actuaries. So that's the process to ensure the integrity of the reserves.","In terms of the changes, which is the second point, when we use a variety of methods to enable the accuracy of our reserves -- and when we -- when changes are made in the underlying data, we react quickly, so take a look at particularly, at this quarter, as you just noted, about the half of the unfavorable prior reserve adjustments related to litigation accruals, which really were from many years ago. Secondly, it has to do with an increase in case reserves for our major medical claims. And those case reserves were increased earlier than our past patterns, because of changes we've made in our claim processes to both improve our customer experience and better manage the claims.","So while we believe that acceleration of what we think would ultimately have been upward development in the claims, we increased our reserves for both last year; so last 2 or 3 years we had and also this year's severity given the long duration of the settlement of medical claims.","So this increase was determined using a variety of methods. We continue to look at those and as the period of time goes along, we believe that the methods will come together as we do the final payouts and the cases are settled. Does that...","Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And I guess, I had one more. It sounds like you guys are of the view that some of the frequency blip might be an industry issue in general. And I'm just trying to understand, why might we have seen this more at Allstate now and perhaps not in a lot of peers? I'm not sure if it's geographic or anything along those lines. And also just drilling down within the customer base, where are you seeing above average increases at miles driven versus below-average?","Steven E. Shebik","I think as it relates to competitive, it's hard to answer that question, right. So you saw the Geico's Q, you can look at Progressive's numbers, you can -- but there is -- it's always a question, in part, of like when you start like you're looking at percentage ups versus absolute levels. So there is some obviously, some state mix in there, there is weather-related mix, there is how you grew your business. So it's -- we can't answer the question as it relates to the other people. We can answer the question which Matt talked extensively about, which is, we don't see anything in the way we have done our business -- and we have the ability to slice and dice our data, as if we were our own competitor, right -- so we can slice and dice it in a whole bunch of ways, and we do think it's comprehensive. Matt, do you want to take the second piece?","Matthew E. Winter","The second piece was -- I'm sorry, where we're seeing miles driven? Miles driven is essentially, I think, Tom in the last call referred to it as an indicator of economic activity. And I think that's really a way to view it. And so it's been very consistent when you look at miles driven in those regions of the country that have seen an increase in overall economic activity, lowered unemployment rate or higher investment or higher home construction. There is a whole bunch of different ways of looking at it. But economic activity has spurred miles driven, which has spurred frequency.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of questions here. How important is channels? So if we look at captive versus the independent agency channel, and your ability to push for pricing to offset the impact of these loss trends that you're seeing. It seems like, in retentions looked pretty good in the quarter, new applications were higher. So I'm just trying to get an idea, I mean, is it really just a timing difference in your ability to kind of right size or do you expect to start seeing some pressure from a ceiling on pricing?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, I would start with, it's really about best value for the customer based on what they want. So if you look at the Allstate agency segment, they want local advice, they want a broad set of products and services. And they obviously, want a good price as well. And so it is price-sensitive. But if you sell them there 2 cars and a house, and a boat and all kinds start raising their price by $15 or $20 a year, isn't going to change that relationship or that value equation in a substantive way. So we tend to look at it in terms of what's the customer value proposition, how you give them best value. That's what the quality of the service and the product is as it meets their needs. And then, what is the cost of it?","Obviously, the channel then subjects that value proposition to different levels of competition. So when you're in the Allstate channel, that -- do not really subject to competition from a whole bunch of other people because you've got that local relationship.","If you're in the independent agency channel, there is more competition around that value proposition. So it tends to be a little bit more price sensitive up there. And to those people that are in that segment tend to value brands a little differently. They would, sort of, if I know the company that's good enough as opposed to I really have a long-standing relationship and I've been part of Allstate for a long time. That person tends -- that second person tends to be less price-sensitive. So there tends to be more price competition in the upper left of our four quadrants, that's the independent agency channel. There also tends to be a little more competition on the right-hand side of the page, which is the self-serve segment, because the relationship is not as strong.","And they're doing a lot of the work themselves, so they can go out and get it. There still is in the branded segment where Esurance is highly focused, a fair some -- a focus on am I getting the right kind of product and service and is it easy for me? So it's not just how do I go get another $5 off on this price? So -- but I would say the lower left tends to be the least price-sensitive segment out of all of them.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I guess for Matt. I mean, so taking that into consideration, I mean, you've taken clearly, took some rate action in 4Q that you talked about and you took more in 1Q, then you took more in April. Where are we in the process in terms of kind of getting us back to kind of where we were before we saw this change in trend? And have those actions now sort of addressed the issue, at this point? And you mentioned pulling rate forward, should we expect that you will continue to balance an opportunity for rate in the captive channel to sort of get yourself back to where you want to be. And does the environment -- is the environment at this point conducive to that?","Matthew E. Winter","We are earning good returns. We're doing a great job for our customers. Our customer Net Promoter score is up. We're growing the business, we're getting good returns in the auto insurance business. And so I don't want the conversation to be too -- I mean, we are reacting to what is normal in any market place in any business, which is as you have your cost go up, you work to make sure that you're maintaining the returns where you want them to be.","The first quarter was a slight blip up. But we're doing what we normally do. Which is what we are trying to explain is, we look to see is it our problem or everybody's problem? If it's everybody's problem we'll just keep compete and keep growing. So I don't think this is about getting back to some place versus being at a place we don't want to be.","We had a good profit this quarter. We made really good returns on our homeowner business in part because of low caps. But we didn't make as much money in auto insurance this quarter, in part because of weather, in part because we have to adjust prices reflecting economic activities. The strength of what we got going is we have lots of levers we can pull, whether that's by product, by channel, by customer segment, the way we think about it to help us achieve what we're supposed to do for our shareholders which is to get a good return. Last 12 months, we've had a 13% return on equity, and we just gave back $1 billion in cash. So we think that's a pretty good offer.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, just lastly, I guess, just as a follow-up. Is there a tailwind from more economic activity for your business as well, we sort of focus on the frequency impact, but is there an offsetting tailwind to premium or policies that we should think about as well?","Matthew E. Winter","Well, sure. I mean there is couple of tailwinds as the country continues to grow and given where we are, we will continue to grow with it. The other part to that is in the investment portfolio, we are basically long U.S. growth; the way we positioned our portfolio, that being shifting into more performance-based investments and keeping our duration short in the investment portfolio. So as growth goes up, then you would expect to be able to earn higher returns in you fixed income portfolio at some point of time and that would be a huge tailwind for us. We'll take one more question and then we'll finish it up.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was trying to get your perspective on the underlying combined ratio. The guidance for this year was 87% to 89%. First quarter was 89%. I'm just trying to gauge your level of comfort to stay within the outlook for the full year.","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, if we wanted to change we would've said we wanted to change. I would point out its a full year number, we are committed to that full year number. We see no reason to change that number at this point. Obviously, you would prefer to start a year at the low end of your range rather than outside your range, which we did not. Being at the high end of the range, just means we have to continue to work to get our commitment done.","I would also point out that 90% of our business had an underlying combined ratio of 87.4 that's the Allstate brand piece. So we feel like we're in good shape for running the business the way we want to do it.","Let me close it off because I know you have other things and we are appreciative of the time you give us. We had good results this quarter, good balanced results. You can see the strength of the broad-base of our business model, which is not just one product, not just one customer segment, not just one investment offering, and investment strategy. We have a lot of levers we can continue to pull to earn good returns for our shareholders. We continue to generate not only good returns on equity, but also good cash returns for our shareholders. And we expect to continue to do that as we go forward. Thank you very much, have a great quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

We also completed the capital restructuring program that we initiated early last year.","So, let\u2019s go through each of these and then Steve will cover the operating results. So, the visual depiction of our strategy is on Slide 3. On an overall basis, we achieved policy in force growth of 2% when compared to the previous year quarter, which resulted in a 5.2% increase in net written premiums. Overall, profitability was good with recorded combined ratio of 94.7 despite severe winter weather and the launch of a new advertising program for Esurance. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 88.4, which is in the range we have provided for the full year.","Growth was achieved in all segments as you can see from the data in each of the brand specific boxes. If you start in the lower left, which is the largest segment in the market and the largest segment for us which is served by Allstate agencies, we had continued broad-based unit growth of 2.1% in auto, which was offset by a 1.2% decline in homeowners policies given the success of our repositioning of the homeowners line we expect that decline for homeowners to become less of a drag on growth in the future. The recorded and underlying combined ratios were in line with expectations.","Esurance in the lower right had another quarter of strong growth. The combined ratio is about where we expected it. There were a number of offsetting pieces. First, there was a large increase in advertising expense. There were the benefits of the profit improvement actions we have put in place in 2013 and then the impact of severe winter weather. The advertising expenses were 28% of premiums in the quarter as we launched new advertising to reinforce the insurance for the modern world positioning.","Encompass in the upper left also continued to grow, but at a slower rate than last year. That reflects the profitability improvement actions we have put in place last year and are still working on this year. Answer Financial sells non-proprietary policies through the web and call centers in the upper right, non-proprietary premium increased 10% over the prior year. So, we like the strategic and operating flexibility that the utilization of these different offerings gives us in the marketplace.","If you go to Slide 4 our five operating priorities are shown on this page. We just discussed the insurance policies in force growth. So, let\u2019s move to maintaining the combined ratio. The underlying for the combined ratio for the quarter is within our full year outlook. So, it\u2019s a good start to the year. This includes, of course, the impact of severe winter weather. We have been within or better than our expected annual range every year since we started this practice in 2007. And investment returns were good in the quarter. The expected decline in interest income was partially offset by another strong quarter of limited partnership investments. You will remember we shortened the duration of the property liability portfolio, because we did not like the risk and return trade-off of investing in long bonds. As a result, the portfolio yield has decreased versus the last year first quarter.","The priority to modernize the operating platform reflects programs to simplify our technology infrastructure and continuous improvement actions, both of which provides greater operating flexibility and improved customer satisfaction levels. Building growth platforms is another important priority given the operating and financial strength of the current business. Improving the Allstate agency effectiveness and expanding capacity to growth in that largest customer segment, expanding Esurance\u2019s product offering will allow us to compete more effectively against the large direct carriers to primarily sell auto insurance. Leveraging the Allstate Benefits platform, which were at 10% over last year is another source of profitable growth.","If you move to Slide 5, the financial results generated in the quarter reflect our growth initiatives and proactive approach to managing margins and risk. Revenues were $8.7 billion or 2.6% higher than 2013. This reflects 5.2% growth in the Allstate protection net written premium partially offset by lower capital gains in investment income. Net income of $587 million declined from the prior year quarter primarily due to a decline in operating income and realized capital gains.","Operating income of $588 million was 9.1% lower than in the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather related losses. Operating income per diluted share decreased only 3.7% to $1.30 reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases on EPS. Operating income return on equity was 14.4% for the trailing 12 months. We continue to provide strong cash return to the shareholders this quarter, it\u2019s been our history with $113 million of common stock dividend and $987 million in share repurchases for a total of $1.1 billion.","Steve will now cover the operating results in greater detail.","Steve Shebik","Thanks Tom. I will start by reviewing the first quarter financial highlights on Slide 6. Starting in the upper left, property-liability had earned premium of $7.1 billion in the first quarter, 4.2% higher in the first quarter of 2013 and a recorded combined ratio of 94.7. The underlying combined ratio was 88.4 for the quarter, which is within our full year outlook range of 87 to 89. Catastrophe losses were $445 million, 24% higher in the first quarter of 2013. Net investment income for the property-liability segment was down 8.5% in the prior year quarter, reflecting interest rate risk reduction actions taken during 2012 and 2013. As a result, property-liability operating income in the first quarter was $468 million, 15.8% lower than the first quarter of 2013.","The property-liability combined ratio on a recorded and underlying basis is shown in the chart on the upper right hand side of the slide. You can see that both the recorded and underlying combined ratios rose in the first quarter. Severe winter weather as Tom had mentioned impacted the combined ratios of all three brands in the first quarter. The table below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio by brand for the past five quarters. We have also broken out the Esurance underlying loss ratio to provide greater visibility excluding investments in advertising and expansion which are immediately expensed.","The Esurance loss ratio remains higher than we would like it to be on a long-term basis so we continued to adjust price \u2013 pricing underwriting to ensure long-term profitable growth. These actions had negative impact on growth which is offset by higher spending on a new advertising campaign to further strengthen the Esurance brand. The Encompass brand\u2019s combined ratio for the first quarter was 102.6. The underlying combined ratio of 91.8% in the first quarter was 6.1 points lower in the first quarter of 2013 and reflects the benefit of ongoing profit improvement actions. We expect to continue our profit improvement initiatives for both Esurance and Encompass brands.","Allstate Financial on the bottom end of the slide had a 4.8% increase in premiums and contract charges in the first quarter including a 7.8% increase for Allstate Benefits. Operating income of $189 million was a 31% improvement over the first quarter of 2013, driven by increased investment margin and lower expenses. Net income of $162 million for the first quarter includes an additional $18 million after tax loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","On Slide 7, we showed net written premium and policies in force by brand. For Protection in upper left chart the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began in the second quarter of 2013. Overall, policies grew 2% from last year and 0.5% during the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2013. Each brand achieved growth in the first quarter in both net written premium and policies compared with the prior year\u2019s quarter.","Moving to the upper right chart Allstate brand policies ended the quarter 1.1% higher than the first quarter of 2013. Allstate brand grew net written premium 4.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter driven by continued favorable trends in both retention and new business as well as higher average premium. Allstate brand auto net written premium increased 3.3% from the prior year while policies rose 2.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Allstate brand homeowners\u2019 net written premium grew 5.8%, but policied in force declined by 1.2% compared with the prior year.","On the bottom two charts you can see growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Both brands continued their growth in premium and policies in force compared to the first quarter of 2013. Esurance\u2019s rate of growth is slowing due to its increasing size and the pricing and underwriting actions being taken to ensure long-term profitable growth, partially offset by the impact of the higher advertising investment. Keep in mind that the scales on the charts for these businesses are much smaller than the charts at the top of the page.","Moving on to Slide 8, the charts on the left hand side show the earned premium and the underlying loss trends for Allstate Brand auto and home, while the charts in the right show the combined ratio trend. For Allstate Brand auto, you can see the impact of non-catastrophe weather in the underlying loss ratio compared with a very favorable first quarter of 2013. Physical damage frequencies increased during the quarter due to challenging winter driving conditions. This increase was concentrated in Midwestern and Eastern states and accounts for almost all of the increase of physical damage frequency in the quarter.","Finally, injury frequency declined slightly, while severity showed only modest growth over prior year. We continue to take rate increases as needed in the first quarter as shown on the graph on the upper right, with average state-specific rate increases of 2.5% in 19 states. Despite higher underlying losses in the first quarter, the underlying combined ratio for auto was still within our expected range. For Allstate Brand homeowners, shown on the bottom half of the slide, the first quarter story is similar to auto. Underlying loss costs per policy plus an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses such as frozen pipes, ice damage, and higher levels of fire losses. The first quarter increase in homeowners\u2019 losses was driven by states that experienced lower than average temperatures.","The combined ratio trends for Allstate Brand homeowners are shown on the lower right hand chart. You can see our underlying 12-month average has essentially flattened out as we approach price adequacy. The composition of our investment portfolio is presented at the top of Slide 9. Over time, we are shifting toward an asset mix we believe will have higher returns. We expect to rely less on interest-bearing assets and more in equity and other assets, where returns is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance.","Interest income will remain the largest and more stable component to investment results, while equity investments will have attractive but more available returns in the time. The lower left graph shows first quarter investment income before expenses of $999 million and a portfolio yield of 4.5%. The expected decline in the interest bearing yields 4.1% from 4.3% in the first quarter of 2013 reflects the interest rate reduction in the property liability portfolio and a smaller portfolio due to Allstate financial liability balances. Strong limited partnership income partially offset lower income from the interest bearing portfolio.","The last column in the table shows investment results for the quarter exclusive of LDL. The yields are unchanged, but investment income was $126 million lower. Our total portfolio return, presented at the bottom right, was a strong 2.1% for the first quarter reflecting improved fixed income valuations and positive equity market performance. You can see, however, the devaluation impact has been highly variable, while the income yields have been relatively stable in the last five quarters.","Finally, on Slide 10, we provide a view of our capital position at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed the capital restructuring plan commenced last year, which included tendering for and replacing higher fee from senior debt with a mix of lower cost senior debt, hybrids and preferred stock. The result is a capital structure that is stronger and more efficient, along with enhanced financial and strategic flexibility. On the top left chart, we show our capital structure both pre- and post-restructuring, where you can see the substantial reduction in senior debt levels and the increase of hybrid debt preferred stock. A full form review of our capital mix adjusted for the expected pay down of approximately $1 billion of debt during 2014 is also shown on the far left bar.","We finished the first quarter with $22.1 billion in total shareholders\u2019 equity, book value per share of 46.70 increased 3.1% since year end and 7.5% since March 31 of last year. The statutory surplus of our operating companies continues to reflect the financial strength of our insurance operations, while deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $3.4 billion at quarter\u2019s end. During the quarter, our Board authorized a new $2.5 billion common stock repurchase program, increased our common share dividend by 12%, which enabled us to return $1.1 billion in cash to common shareholders during the quarter.","After completing our previous $2 billion authorization, we began repurchasing common shares under the new program both through open market purchases and the execution of an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Overall, during the first quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million common shares for $987 million. The final number of shares we repurchased under the ASR will be determined when the contract is approved. In addition, we paid 113 million in common stock dividends during the quarter.","Overall, in the first quarter, we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and achieved each of our operating priorities. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue to effectively execute our differentiated strategy, while delivering strong returns to shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Your question please.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Good morning, and let me echo your kind memories of Bob, Tom, he\u2019s definitely be missed by all. Question on Esurance, what exactly is the strategy right now? It seems like the increase in advertising would suggest that you think you\u2019ve got the underwriting fixed within the plan. Is that a fair read of the scenario?","Tom Wilson","Bob thanks for the comments about, Bob. They make a macro comment about Esurance is to how it fits into our overall portfolio and then Don can talk about the new advertising program. So, first, we like having four approaches to the marketplace. It gives us ability to get very clean customer value propositions for each of those target segments. For example, an Esurance segment is one of the components of the customer value proposition is give me tools to make me smart, whereas in the Allstate agency channel, it would be my agency \u2013 and my agent knows me so, we can see the difference that \u2013 you can think of that difference as it relates to our operating so, we like the ability it gives us to really hone in and get a customer exactly what they want. It also gives us the ability to compete more effectively against those people who are trying to serve multiple brands and so, we use those brands in conjunction to compete on two fronts as suppose to just competing on one front.","We \u2013 obviously in all brands, they are supposed to make the adequate return on capital and we\u2019ve talked about Esurance is progress to improve their loss ratio. We\u2019re happy with where the progress they\u2019re making but they are not where they need to be at. That said that doesn\u2019t stop us from wanting to continue to invest and compete aggressively because the returns are still above our cost of capital in that business. So, Don, perhaps you want to talk about the new advertising program john, you\u2019re actually want to talk about the new advertising program and what we have going.","Don Civgin","Yes, hey, Bob, first of all, let me reiterate, I mean our strategy with Esurance is to grow the business as fast as possible while maintaining positive economics over the lifetime of the business we\u2019re running. And we\u2019ve talked about this many times before, but that\u2019s, by definition, going to be reflected in a higher GAAP combined ratio, which you saw again this quarter. It was a pretty exciting quarter for Esurance and they built on a number of things that they\u2019ve been doing with the customer value proposition by continuing to build their advantage. So they continue to be the only direct multiline carrier with the addition of motorcycle homeowners. They continue to build out their features which are making their product differentiated from the competitors and they continue to improve the ease of doing business. The ad campaign, I think we transitioned this past quarter. In the past, we talked about Esurance and what quadrant and what customers they were serving.","This past quarter we spent more effort to make sure people understood just how good we were getting within that quartile and against the competitor. So you see us \u2013 went very aggressively against the fact that we can do quotes on the Esurance website instead of the half minutes and obviously we put a lot of advertising rate behind that you can see in the supplement, another 12.8 points in expense. I say by all measures that campaign has worked quite well. The Super Bowl campaign, we had 3.4 million entrants, we had 2.7 billion social impressions. Unaided awareness and consideration of the brand is up to all-time highs. The trust level is up. The quotes are obviously up pretty dramatically in the quarter. And I think those are good results in particular because we\u2019ve been taking a lot of pricing action and lot of underwriting action to get the loss ratio back to where we wanted to be and while we\u2019re not entirely there, as Tom said, absent the January, February whether we\u2019ve actually seen a nice improvement in the loss ratio during the first quarter. I would also say that the results for Esurance in the first quarter are particularly good because we know at least through February, that the main competitors had substantially increased their spend as well.","So, I think we feel good about where the campaign is working, it is all predicated our Esurance building a customer value proposition that is differentiated than the competition. And so I think we will continue to build that out, but we still have work to do on the loss ratio and Gary and the team are all over that and we continued to expect \u2013 I would continue to expect us to improve the loss ratio throughout this year. But it\u2019s going to come at same on pressure on the top line.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Okay. And the final question is what free cash was generated from your life company, is it consistent with what your earlier guidance was going to be?","Tom Wilson","Bob, do you mean free cash on the sale of Lincoln Benefit or free cash in total?","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Yes.","Tom Wilson","It\u2019s consistent with what we have, which was $1 billion of freed up capital, but we got \u2013 as you know we got to move it through the system to get it up to the holding company.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Your question please.","Josh Stirling - Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the call. So I wanted to ask you a question, a follow-up on Bob\u2019s question on Esurance, so just to be clear you guys have doubled your ad spend at least in sort of recent run rate. I am wondering if that\u2019s sort of a sense of how you expect to continue to spend money in Esurance. And as we think about looking to profitability of the business going forward should we expect you to continue to spend that kind of money should end and as we think about sort of total earnings is this sort of thing that pays off over the next year or two. Are we going to be lagging sort of the additional ad spend in terms of sort of Esurance driven profitability and Esurance driven underlying growth for some time? Thank you.","Tom Wilson","Good morning, Josh. Thanks for your question. Let me split it into a couple of pieces when we launch a new advertising program that\u2019s trying to get new features across, we invest every year upfront in that than we would on a continuing basis. So you saw that whether that\u2019s you buy a Super Bowl ad which is expensive or you just buy a lot more media in February, March. We don\u2019t disclose what our future advertising program will be because that tends to competitive. But the normal pattern will be you invest heavier upfront and then you come back to something that\u2019s more sustainable over time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it at the same \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t expect to see it at the same level and for the rest of the year as you would here. But that said we do believe that to the extent we are writing economic business, we have the earnings capacity as the total company to continue to grow. We have brands that we will continue invest to the extent it is economic. So I would \u2013 our commitment is to grow the business in total to balance between the brands that deliver the right strategy and to serve each customer. How we move that the money around between them as long as we are meeting our overall underlying combined ratio commitment to the street, we feel like we \u2013 it should use the strategic and operating flexibility to drive what are the ultimate economics for the shareholders which is discounted of cash flow. Is that helpful?","Josh Stirling - Bernstein","Yes. That\u2019s helpful Tom. Thank you. And if I can ask you just sort of a bigger question and I was sort of looking beyond the numbers to trying to link some of your strategies together, you guys have a very broad product set auto, home, accident, house and traditional life and a couple years ago, you are talking about sort of cross selling I think we are seeing you started to do that, obviously, Esurance, Encompass has been successful for \u2013 with the package for long time and you got sort of the voluntary benefits thing working and in your Allstate brand I am wondering if you can sort of give us the sense of how big a lever this is especially in your more mature channels, will you actually be able to get any meaningful sort of cross selling opportunities from selling say voluntary benefits to PNC or term life and things like that to PNC customers?","Tom Wilson","I will make a general comment and Matt can talk about the efforts he has undertaken on what we would call the trusted advisor. So you are right we do have a broad range of products in the portfolio. We are thrilled actually, you saw that Allstate Benefits has now over $3 million policyholders that sometimes gets lost by people. Our Good Hands Roadside is well over 1.5 customers. So we have garnered these \u2013 and that\u2019s product we launched like three years ago or something. We garnered these people like with millions and it tends to get lost because they are so large, but we do think it is an advantage for us. We obviously Don mentioned the work that Esurance is doing to leverage the skills and capabilities we have in the company. We have also created our business-to-business unit under Kathy Mabe, we\u2019re just trying to leverage that broad set of skills and capabilities as it relates to business customers because we\u2019ve always been highly focused on consumers. We think we have plenty to offer businesses, particularly small businesses, and so we have a lot of work going on there. And then, as you point out, we\u2019ve been at in our main channel with Allstate agencies, we\u2019ve been working on having multiline relationships for as long as I been here, which is 19 years. And made some progress, but it\u2019s been one of those areas where we feel like we have much greater potential. And Matt is hard at work on that trusted advisor piece. Matt, do you want to talk a little about\u2026","Matt Winter","Thanks, Tom. So that the company as Tom has described it several times before is really in an evolutionary status. So, we went through period early on where there was an attempt to create a bundled offering for our customers. But that was disrupted somewhat by what happened with homeowners for a four to five period as we had to do some risk mitigation there. When you take homeowners out of the mix, it really is problematic to try to create a diverse set of offerings and present a whole bundled offering to your customers. Now that as you can see homeowners business is back in a fully fledged mode, we then able to shift out of what I call the subcontractor auto specialist mode to more of a general contractor trusted advisor mode for our agency owners who are able to position themselves as the personal risk advisors for their customers offering a variety of risk mitigation and protection products including not only auto, not only home, but life products, but retirement products, motorcycle, renters, LPP, the full line of personalized products in life and retirement products that an individual customer might need and might come to an Allstate agency owner for. The trusted advisor model is based upon some work done by David Meister \u2013 the Meister model and many of you in consulting and others probably familiar with that model and we begun shifting towards a trust based advisory model here and are building the entire system around including the technology, information, capabilities for the agency owners. The processes we\u2019re doing a fair amount of continuous improvement, re-engineering work to change some of the work flows. We\u2019re doing some work that we call unbundling the value chain to make sure that our agency owners are spending their time and energy and the staff is spending their time and energy and think that truly add value to the customers.","When you take all of that and combine it, the impact should be and we\u2019re seeing very encouraging early signs of it that they are shifting to more bundled offerings. They are approaching their clients, their customers in a more holistic manner and when we look at our new homeowners business, our homeowners new business right now that 80% of that is bundled with auto, 40% already have an existing auto policy and our purchasing homeowners on top of that, and 40% added a new auto policy at the same time as they purchased the homeowners policy. That\u2019s combined with what are exceptionally strong growth trends in our consumer household lines now shows us that our agency owners are now living into that new model. Life and retirement is going to be more difficult voluntary benefits I could along with that, just because it\u2019s a different type of business from many of them for their longer term agents, it\u2019s something they are not that familiar with for many years. They were used to passing on those leads to others and involving our financial specialists from a distance in that opportunity and now we\u2019re asking them to work with their financial specialist in the more integrated manner. So, I think it holds, and Tom thinks it holds, great promise for us as a company. I think it\u2019s core to our differentiated value proposition for the Allstate agency owners. And I think you should expect to see it receive the increasing degree of emphasis and importance over the next several years.","Josh Stirling - Bernstein","Thanks, Matt, Tom. I appreciate the thorough answer. Good luck.","Tom Wilson","Thank you. I am very excited about what Matt has got going there. Beside, as Matt pointed out the alignment with customers, we are building stronger local businesses \u2013 those agencies which are worth billions of dollars. One of Matt\u2019s jobs is also to make those agencies worth more and to the extent they have a stronger relationship with customers, it makes them more valuable. I am very excited about what it does for them and for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you. First, for the impact of non-cat weather on the underlying combined ratio in the quarter, what was that versus a year ago?","Tom Wilson","Jay- Matt do you want to I think maybe just talk about winter weather frequency. You are talking about frequencies, is that right Jay.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Yes. I mean I am sure there is a good portion of winter weather that\u2019s not included in the cat impacts I am just trying to get a better sense of the baseline on the underlying excluding the impact of non-cat weather?","Tom Wilson","No, it\u2019s really a good question and as you know we manage our business with great precision. Matt can deal with that\u2026","Matt Winter","Yes. So Jay, it\u2019s interesting it was intuitive to all of us that winter weather is going to have an impact on first quarter. But we wanted to really spend some time looking at it in a granular \u2013 at a granular level to ensure that we weren\u2019t just kind of discounting the rise in frequency as the result of winter weather when we weren\u2019t absolutely 100% sure that was the causing factor. So we did some a fairly intense work on a state-by-state basis. So let me give you some facts because I think rather than just conclusions the facts should be helpful. And I will do it on auto and I will do with then on a home for you. So when you look at physical damage frequency for total auto, it was \u2013 the increase was driven entirely by states that experienced increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures that caused icing, so let me give you a breakdown there. We had 25 states and we do this comparison by month, by state comparing this year\u2019s snowfall and temperature with last year\u2019s snowfall and temperature looking for statistically significant deviations and what the impact was on frequency. We had 25 states that had increased snowfall and elevated frequency and those 25 states represented about 55% of our premium (indiscernible).","The first quarter PD frequency in those states was 7% above the three year average. If you look at the 10 states with the largest increase in snowfall that account for 25% of the total, they contributed over 50% of the unfavorable variance in frequency. So that\u2019s just on the snowfall side. Now look at the temperature side which as I said caused unexpected icing there we had 32 states with colder temperatures that includes 24 of the 25 snowfall states. For some reason Wyoming was an outlier there, that represented 60% of premium in it. And there too we had a 7% rise in three year \u2013 above our three year average for PD frequency. And if you look at those 10 states with the largest decrease in temperature, they contributed over 75% of the unfavorable variance in frequency. So clearly the frequency actually improved in the rest of the country that wasn\u2019t impacted by statistically significant increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures.","We did the same thing on the homeowner side and remember homeowners we basically experienced three major winter impacts frozen pipes in the Eastern half of the company \u2013 country, fire losses from heating sources in the South especially in Georgia and Texas and ice damming from temperature fluctuations in the Midwest. And the non-cat examples of those \u2013 the space heaters, the fire, the ice damming, many of the frozen pipe claims would not come as cats, they would show up in underlying due to reporting delays, it\u2019s hard to attach them to one particular stronger event and as you know, house fires aren\u2019t cats either.","So you look at the impact there 30 states with colder temperature and higher loss ratios representing 70% of the premium NF, that was a 16 percentage point loss ratio increase including cash. So, fairly significant, one other little factoid for you, we had more freeze claims in January alone than the previous 24 months combined, which is a fairly significant occurrence and the biggest one was the January 2nd freeze event in the Midwest and Northeast down to Georgia so, again if you take out those areas impacted by the lower temperatures that cause the house fires, the frozen pipes and the ice damming, the loss ratio absolutely improved in the rest of the country. Did I answer your question, Jay?","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Yes, just back on the original point, what was the \u2013 can you quantify the impact of non-cat weather in that underlying combined ratio of 88.4?","Tom Wilson","Matt gave you the impact on our frequency. We haven\u2019t taken it so close to say it\u2019s X point of the combined ratio. I would say when you go above all that if you look at our auto combined ratio it\u2019s 93 to 94, depending on which one that you want to use, whether it\u2019s underlying reported. And so, we covered at that way or if you look at homeowners, what we\u2019ve done with homeowners is combined ratio was 87.25 basis. So, while it\u2019s clearly \u2013 and you would expect it to bounce around, so we don\u2019t want to \u2013 weather happens every quarter, sometimes it happens in January and February and it\u2019s cold, sometimes it\u2019s fog, sometimes it\u2019s other things, so we don\u2019t want to act like you should ignore the impact of weather. We still are responsible for an overall combined ratio, but that gave you was the information to help you see that. We don\u2019t think the bump in the underlying combined ratio up is a sustainable bump to the general trends around the country, which are not weather related. But I don\u2019t want you also just taken out and say that next quarter that we\u2019re not going to have weather because we\u2019ll have weather every quarter, is that make sense.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","I understand. Absolutely, and then just a quick follow-up on Esurance, it looks like the company is looking to raise rates to address the loss ratio issue. But at the same time, ad spend is also going up, so how do you clarify those two countervailing issues?","Tom Wilson","How about we want it all? We want to grow and we want to make money.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Fair enough. Thank you.","Tom Wilson","I\u2019m looking at Don as I say that.","Operator","Our next question is from John Hall of Wells Fargo. Your question please.","John Hall - Wells Fargo","Good morning, everyone. My first question has to do with Allstate Financial. During the quarter, there was a quite significant drop in the expenses over there. I was just wondering if you could comment on sort of the profit profile of Allstate Financial going forward ex-LVL and whether that drop in expenses is a permanent stair step down.","Tom Wilson","Okay, Don will take that.","Don Civgin","Yes, let me first address the LVL question, it\u2019s \u2013 we had about $34 million of operating income in the quarter that was related to LVL and so obviously going forward that business is no longer part of Allstate. As it relates to expenses given that we reduced the size of our business pretty substantially, you should expect that expenses will come down. We\u2019ve been hard at work during the last six or nine months of expenses. A lot of it is driven by the headcount. The fact is we\u2019re running the smaller business, we\u2019re running a simpler business. Matt and Tom talked earlier about advancing the Allstate customer value proposition with the Trusted Advisor and Allstate Financial over the last 10 years or so has been in a lot of distribution channels that takes a lot of resources, a lot of efforts. With the conclusion of the LVL transaction, we are now committed 100% to the Allstate customer. There\u2019s only one channel. We\u2019re all in on the Trusted Advisor Model. So we\u2019re changing our expense structure and our organization around to simplify it quite honestly make the adjustments we need to because we simply can\u2019t spend the way we did two or three years ago and we\u2019ve been successful in that. We\u2019ve also had benefits from lower pension expense from what we did last year and some shared services expenses and so forth as well. It isn\u2019t all just what we\u2019ve done. But yes we\u2019re committed to getting the expenses down so we can maintain our profitability.","Tom Wilson","John, there is a paragraph in the queue that does a good job of breaking out the three components of that which \u2013 when you get a chance we can direct it to you.","John Hall - Wells Fargo","Great, thank you. And then just following up on the homeowners if I look at the ads that you guys have been running fire kitchen \u2013 kitchen fire and return of Mayhem as a cleaning person, it seems that you\u2019re actually targeting homeowners rather directly. Should we be expecting homeowners to go from a negative PIF to a positive PIF over the near term?","Tom Wilson","I would agree with everything you said other than perhaps near term. We\u2019re obviously working and Matt\u2019s team\u2019s hard work as we talked about and Trusted Advisor is driving that. We\u2019ve not yet called when we think that negative will become positive but obviously with what we\u2019ve done with the homeowners business we like to turn it into a growth initiative as well.","John Hall - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your question please.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Hi, good morning. The first question is really on the loss trends versus the earned premiums. In the last four quarters, the loss trends seemed to be up around 1.9% to 2.4% on the Allstate brand auto. And the earned premiums I believe are up around 0.7%. So \u2013 now you guys are taking pricing up (2.4%) now, so that should be a positive for the future. Just curious as to whether we should expect pressure on margins at least in the near term while the earned premiums catch up with the loss trends?","Tom Wilson","Vinay, this is Tom, I\u2019ll ask Matt to deal with both where he feels they are in pricing and loss cost trends in auto in general. We do read all of your \u2013 everybody stuff and earlier this morning we\u2019re trying to figure out to you 19. So we couldn\u2019t, so we\u2019ll get back to you on the specific on the 19 after the call. But Matt can talk in general about both where he feels the business and what he is doing to make sure we keep in line with our second priority which is to maintain underlying combined ratios.","Matt Winter","Good morning, Vinay. We\u2019re overall feeling very good about where we stand in auto in the underlying and our margin and our capabilities for continued growth and maintenance of good profitability. As I\u2019ve talked about on previous calls we really run the auto business by geography not solely as one large system and it\u2019s managed on a real-time basis by quite confident teams at the market operating committee level who are aware of what\u2019s going on in each geography, watching trends emerge, looking at regulatory issues, watching demographics and other factors and making calls on a day-to-day basis to ensure we\u2019re staying ahead of those trends to the extent we can and that we\u2019re maintaining the margins.","And as I said before we breakdown our combined ratio and our loss ratio in what I would call almost agonizing detail. We know what\u2019s happening there. We\u2019re not surprised by any and we feel confident that we\u2019re approaching it in a rational way. We\u2019re as I\u2019ve said also previously trying to optimize the point between growth and profitability to ensure we\u2019re able to continue the kind of growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing recently. We just had in terms of new business production, one of the best total auto quarters since 2001. We like that. Retention is up significantly and it has been up for a steady period of time now and we like that. And we\u2019re balancing our desire to grow, capture market share and retain profitability and ensure we meet all the commitments we\u2019ve made regarding underlying combined ratio.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The second question was on the net investment income on the P&C portfolio and I\u2019m looking at it ex-prepays and litigation. And we actually saw per stabilization in the \u2013 some interest-earning securities there and a stabilization in the yield. Are you doing something now more positive in a sense that changing the asset mix there where we\u2019ll see a stable yield and should we and is your move away from longer duration to shorter duration securities or instead we\u2019ll see more stable net investment income from the earn-out?","Tom Wilson","Judy will answer that question and let me make sure I get the math right. So the stabilization are you talking about the earned deals fourth quarter of 2013 to first quarter of 2014 or.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Yes.","Tom Wilson","Stabilization, okay, because it is down about 20 basis points versus a year ago.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Yes, yes.","Judy Greffin","So there is stabilization and as Tom mentioned over the past year we have moved \u2013 shortened the duration in the portfolio. And that work is largely done. So when you look at the portfolio at this point we\u2019ve got a duration a little bit under three years and you plan to stay there for the time-being. So it isn\u2019t necessarily a change in the mix, it\u2019s more that we\u2019ve done the work that we wanted to do. We\u2019re going to continue to see the impact of the work that we did last year in terms of year-over-year but quarter-over-quarter it has largely stabilized where we are today. And the portfolio yield is down so the differential between where we\u2019re investing today in the portfolio yields isn\u2019t as great as it would have been a few years ago.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Tom, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the other personal lines business I mean it\u2019s come up a little bit more recently in some of the calls. A couple billion dollar book I mean it looks like now three quarters of double-digit growth, margins are in mid-to-high 80s on an underlying basis. Want to just get a little bit better understanding of what\u2019s in there. I mean I guess specifically it looks like the growth is coming from Dealer Services and Roadside. What are the margins in those businesses specifically and are those higher \u2013 if you can tell us higher-margin business than the rest of the stuff that\u2019s in there? Thanks.","Tom Wilson","Okay. I\u2019ll make some general comments and then Kathy you can talk specifically about what we\u2019re doing in Roadside and Dealer Services. But first when you go all the way up in other personal lines there\u2019s lots of other stuff in there. So there is a number of consumer household products where that be personal umbrella policies, many of the policies Matt talked about that fit inside of that organization and are fully integrated with the way we do with our agencies just like auto, home and everything else. In those businesses Matt mentioned are also growing well. So renters and some other things we\u2019re having a good year there. In addition to that as you pointed out we have a number of other really strong and significant businesses that oftentimes don\u2019t get the attention that auto and home do.","So one of those would be Roadside, the other would be Dealer Services. Roadside we have really three parts to that business. There is our standard, our auto \u2013 our Motor Club policies we sell for fee, then we have our Good Hands Roadside where it\u2019s paid when you use it that\u2019s why I mentioned we have over 1.5 customers. And then there is our wholesale business. Kathy, if you can talk about that business is growing quite rapidly in that third piece if she can talk about what she is doing there and what we need to do to \u2013 in terms of profitability there. And then Dealer Services sales extended warranties and things through dealers. That\u2019s also a pretty large business. That\u2019s a longer tail business. So the profitability as you have to \u2013 turns in over time, if she could talk about what we have going there as well.","Kathy Mabe","Thank you, and thank you, Michael. With regard to Roadside, Tom talked about the different components. Inside that in terms of it\u2019s profitability the business is growing rapidly. The wholesale business is less profitable than what we call the retail business or the Allstate segment of the business. So in the short term we\u2019re focused on slowing the growth a little bit in the wholesale side while we focus on increasing the profitability of that segment.","Where at the same time we\u2019re doing picking steps to aggressively grow the Allstate branded part of Roadside which is highly attractive and we\u2019re doing that, Matt talked about the Trusted Advisor that\u2019s a component of key steps we want to sell through the Allstate agency distribution force. With regard to Dealer Services, there are a number of things going on there. It is a rapidly growing business, most of the growth is coming from the vehicle service contract portion of the business. We feel the \u2013 that it\u2019s adequately priced although we\u2019re taking steps to make sure that we\u2019re getting the profit margin that we need on that business and working aggressively to pursue that. We love some of the synergies that we see in Dealer Services with regard to the property casualty business as well and some of the other businesses in B2B.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And I guess the question is I mean you\u2019ve seen them really I mean just looking at your supplement I mean those two have seen the lion\u2019s share of growth in other personal lines over the last at least quarter over the last year. And over that \u2013 over the past couple of years the underlyings have come down and really kind of settled into that 80s, low 90s sort of range. I\u2019m just wondering like are the areas that are growing, are those just more profitable than the others or is there something else that\u2019s happening at the same time that these two areas are growing that\u2019s caused that profitability to kind of settle in? Thanks.","Tom Wilson","I think where Kathy was is the wholesale business, it grew quite rapidly, we picked up GM which was the giant account and actually that business is not as profitable of the other businesses, they actually reduced our overall profitability. And in the Dealer Services business we like to profiting, we think it\u2019s got good pricing and it\u2019s growth is profitable. I think Michael there maybe some other pieces in there in terms of what we\u2019re doing in renters and personal umbrella policies. So I would say let us help you we\u2019ll dissect that for you because I think you\u2019re looking at a broader combined ratio measure than just the businesses that we\u2019re talking about.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","I apologize I have between Jay and John. My questions were answered.","Tom Wilson","Okay. It\u2019s easy.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your question please.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Thanks. One nitpicky question. The corporate expenses went down \u2013 were flat year-over-year, but were down significantly from the fourth quarter. Is the first quarter number a good run rate going forward?","Tom Wilson","You\u2019re talking about the corporate expense line we\u2019ve broken out. So there is \u2013 you have \u2013 yes interest expenses down some and then there are some shared service cost that rattled through their pension and other things that are down. In terms of the number we mentioned we took a big shot because we restructured the pension plans added to the balance sheet and as a result in terms of \u2013 we took the liability down and reduced our expenses by well over $100 million a year. So part of that rattles through but a large part of that also as Don mentioned gets allocated back out to him, so which is a good thing so \u2013 because it gets reflected in the profitability of our businesses. So but there is no big trends going on in corporate I guess \u2013 I\u2019d say once you get through the capital restructuring plan and you got to look at the preferred dividends relative to interest expense because that shows up in a different line item. So\u2026","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, no, that\u2019s helpful. Bigger picture I guess is there a time frame for expanding the target focus of the Encompass to maybe attack a more broad segment of the independent agency customer base?","Tom Wilson","Our current strategy with Encompass is to continue to rollout and expand the package policy because we think we have room geographically to do that and room within some of the agencies to do it that we exist to do business with. And why we\u2019re doing that we\u2019re still working to improve profitability in some of the space. So we\u2019ve actually shrunk Meyer the \u2013 what we would call the segment business which is the standalone auto policy over the last four, five years. Over time I believe you\u2019re right that we know how to price auto, we ought to be back and expanding that business, but right now it\u2019s not on our list of priorities.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Tom Wilson","We\u2019ll take one last question.","","Operator","Our final question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question please.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Thanks. Good morning. The BI severity was pretty low. It\u2019s been trending down. Is that more Allstate specific actions or is that some market phenomena?","Tom Wilson","It\u2019s hard to answer what the market phenomena is, but Matt might want to talk some about the actual results we have.","Matt Winter","Yes. I think well that\u2019s an interesting question to try to break it down from the entire market. We have \u2013 as I said before we\u2019ve taken a fair amount of effort to look at this on a state-by-state basis and manage it as well as we could. We \u2013 there is always geographic mix issues and policy limit shifts and other things that impact that. And I guess I would say I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve done anything dramatic recently to indicate a trend line that you should read into this.","Tom Wilson","So remember part of the trend is Florida. We have some profit issues in Florida and New York, they tend to be BI space. So it\u2019s (definitely) \u2013 you really got to look at it by state. And I would say if you go all the way up and it\u2019s we\u2019re \u2013 to the extent our BI cost severities go up, frequency goes up in BI or same with PD frequency or severity will reflect that in our pricing and all of it is manageable if you look at our average pricing and we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Okay, thanks a lot. Very helpful.","Tom Wilson","Thank you all for participating in our strategy. It gives us the flexibility as you can see they\u2019re operating in a variety of different customer segments and we\u2019re going to stay highly focused on our 2014 priorities. And the success we\u2019ve had maybe proactive from an operating and strategic standpoint over the last four years. It put us in a position to just begin to build on a great franchise. Thank you all. We\u2019ll see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for Allstate's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We'll begin this morning with some prepared remarks from Tom Wilson, Steven Shebik and me. Following that, we will open it up for your questions. Joining us for the Q&A session are Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies.","Late yesterday, we issued our press release and investor supplement, as well as our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012. We also posted a slide presentation, which will be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. As noted in our press release and 10-Q, Allstate adopted new deferred acquisition cost accounting guidance on a retrospective basis as of January 1, 2012. Accordingly, all prior period balances have been adjusted. The DAC and shareholders' equity balances were reduced by $572 million and $376 million, respectively, when compared to the previously reported December 31, 2011 balances. We filed an 8-K yesterday reflecting these adjustments, and we added a few pages in our investor supplement that have details on the adjustments. All of these documents can be accessed from our website. ","Referring to the first slide of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Actual results may differ materially from those statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the first quarter 2012, our 8-Ks filed yesterday in May 2 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. ","As always, I'll be available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have. ","Now let's begin with Tom Wilson.","Thomas J. Wilson","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on what I know is a very busy day for you. I'll cover our performance relative to our 2012 priorities. Within the context of our overall strategy, Bob and Steve will follow with more details on the drivers of our results. ","If you go to Slide 2, our strategy is to sell unique protection products to different customer segments. The left side prefers the personal assistance of a local agent, whereas the right side is very comfortable purchasing directly from a call center or over the Web. So lower segments -- the segments on the lower half of the grid are less price sensitive than the upper half. So we serve all 4 segments of customers. ","Our 2012 priorities are to maintain auto profitability, to raise returns in homeowners and the annuity businesses, to grow insurance premiums and to proactively manage our investments and capital. So this strategy and those 2012 priorities are designed to enable us to achieve the goal of producing operating return on equity of 13% by 2014. ","Turning to Slide 3. It was a good start for 2012, with strong financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated basis, we generated net income of $766 million. It was an increase over the prior year first quarter of 46%, and it was driven primarily by improvements in operating results. On an operating income basis, we increased almost 44% to $710 million or $1.42 per diluted share. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio for the quarter was 88.1, which is 1.8 points better than Q1 of 2011. ","Now we made progress in each of our priority areas. We maintained auto profitability in the first quarter, with the Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio of 95.2, an increase of 0.2 points compared to Q1 of 2011. Now there's some pressure on the cost side of business, which we're addressing to protect our margins. We continue to improve returns in homeowners, with an underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand of 67, which is 7 points better than the first quarter of last year and essentially, equal to the fourth quarter of last year. We remain focused on our profit improvement actions in this line, as continued improvement is a critical component to achieving the goal of 13% operating ROE by 2014. ","Allstate Financial's operating income was up largely based on higher partnership income. While we made some improvement in returns on the annuity business due to higher partnership income, the low interest rate environment continues to be a challenge for us in raising returns in that business. ","Overall, premiums increased, reflecting the acquisition of Esurance, higher average homeowner premiums and growth in the emerging businesses. Esurance's policies in force grew in the first quarter from the year-end 2011, as benefits of our new marketing programs begin to be realized. We did have an expected reduction in auto policies and Allstate Agency channel, reflecting profit improvement actions in the auto line in Florida and New York and the impact of raising homeowner prices for multi-line customers. Our investment results were very good despite the challenging interest rate environment. ","Finally, from a capital management perspective, we raised the dividend and repurchased $300 million from the current stock buyback authorization. Our book value per share increased 8% and 6.6% from the first quarter of 2011 and year-end 2011, respectively. ","So now Bob and Steve will provide more details on our results for the quarter.","Robert Block","Turning to Slide 4, we show our top and bottom line results for Property-Liability. Overall, the results were mixed for growth, but profitability was strong. Property-Liability net written premium of $6.46 billion grew 4% versus the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to the acquisition of Esurance, which grew net premiums and policies in force as expected. Allstate brand standard auto net written premium of $3.9 billion declined 1.2% from the first quarter of 2011, as auto profitability actions in New York and Florida and higher homeowner prices hampered growth. ","Unit growth also declined from prior year. The volume of new issued applications was comparable to each of the last 3 quarters but did decline 10.8% from the first quarter of 2011. Average premium on a gross written basis increased 1.8% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We received approval for rate changes in 10 states averaging 5.8% in those states. Retention ratio at 88.7 was down slightly from prior year, driven primarily by Florida and New York. The balance of the country experienced an increase in retention from the first quarter of 2011. ","Allstate brand homeowners net written premium grew 2.7% from the first quarter of 2011, as rate actions designed to improve profitability continue to more than offset the reduction in units. We received approval for rate changes in 13 states averaging 7.9% in those states or 2% on a countrywide basis. ","For the quarter, net written premium for Allstate brand emerging businesses, Encompass and Esurance all positively contributed to the top line. We also experienced favorable sequential unit growth in our Canadian operations, Encompass and Esurance. ","Moving to the bottom half of the slide, the combined ratio for Property-Liability was 92.1, an improvement from the first quarter of 2011 of 2.8 points. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio was 88.1, 1.8 points better than prior year and well within the annual range we provided earlier this year. ","The next slide provides the loss trends in rate actions for the Allstate brand standard auto. On the top half of the slide are the gross frequency and paid severity trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages, which account for about 45% of the incurred losses for Allstate brand standard auto. For the first quarter of 2012, both bodily injury and property damage frequencies improved relative to the prior year for the fourth consecutive quarter. While bodily injury and property damage paid severities were above prior year for the first quarter, the increase moderated relative to the fourth quarter 2011. ","In the lower left-hand corner of the slide, we added a chart on approved rate changes. For Allstate brand standard auto, we averaged about 4% increase over the last 4 quarters, a pace which has kept the combined ratio relatively level. ","In the lower right-hand corner, we provided the combined ratio results for the last few years. In the first quarter of 2012, the combined ratio was 95.2 for Allstate brand standard auto, an increase from prior year of 0.2 points. Breaking the combined ratio apart, the loss ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto improved by 0.7 points compared to prior year's first quarter, while the underwriting expense ratio increased by 0.9 points. On an underlying combined ratio basis, the results for the first quarter were essentially flat with prior year. We remain vigilant in our efforts to maintain auto margins. ","On Slide 6, we display similar charts detailing approved rate changes and loss trends for Allstate brand homeowners. We continue to gain approval for rate changes in the 8% to 9% range countrywide. The chart in the upper right-hand corner provides the trends for loss cost, excluding catastrophes. Frequency results for the first quarter of 2012 were below prior year, while paid severity was flat. The rate actions we have taken, coupled with the moderating loss cost trends, produced an underlying combined ratio of 67.0, an improvement of 7 points from the first quarter of 2011. On a reported basis, the combined ratio for the quarter was 80.2, 11.2 points better than prior year, reflecting the improvement in the underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011. We continue to focus on raising returns in this business.","Shifting the focus to Allstate Financial on Slide 7, we provide results for the top line, the bottom line and returns by product. The results for the first quarter continue to reflect progress towards improving overall returns while shifting our focus to underwritten products. While total premiums and contract charges declined for the quarter, premiums and contract charges for underwritten products increased 3.5% to $535 million compared to the prior year. ","Allstate Agencies continue to generate strong growth over prior year, with a 16% increase in issued life insurance policies. We recorded operating income of $150 million, an increase of $37 million from prior year. The increase in operating income included a $39 million after-tax benefit from a classification of equity method limited partnership income as net investment income in 2012. ","Allstate Financial reported net income for the first quarter of 200 -- or excuse me, $112 million, up $10 million from the first quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from an improvement in operating income in the absence of a loss on the wind-down of the Allstate Bank in 2011, partially offset by current year realized capital losses compared to realized capital gains in the prior year. Operating income return on attributed equity of 8.8% improved 0.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2011, with life insurance at 11.3% return, while accident and health insurance provided a 15.5% return. ","The favorable movement in the return for immediate annuities was driven primarily by the reclassification of equity method limited partnership income and is consistent with our previously disclosed intent to change our asset allocation for long-term immediate annuities. This shift may result in more volatile investment income but should lead to higher total returns. ","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Shebik.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Bob. We continue to proactively manage the investment portfolio, supporting our key objective of managing investment yields and creating value. On Slide 8, you can see the size and composition of our overall portfolio. Improved fixed income and equity valuations, along with a positive cash flow from our Property-Liability business, more than offset the expected reduction of Allstate Financial's spread-based liabilities, raising the portfolio valuation to $97 billion at quarter end. ","Our portfolio actions during the first quarter continue to optimize our fixed income portfolio's position on the yield curve, shifting out of longer-term municipal bonds and shorter-term lower yielding treasuries into intermediate-term investment grade corporate bonds. Additionally, we shifted from public equity holdings to high yield corporate bonds. These actions benefited us as credit spreads narrowed, improving fixed income valuations and also supported our average fixed income portfolio yield. ","Slide 9 highlights the portfolio income in yield trend. As Bob mentioned, we made a prospective change this quarter to classify our equity method limited partnership results in net investment income. We believe that this presentation will closely align the results of our expanding strategies in alternative investments and private asset ownership with the liabilities they support. Including the effects of this change, net investment income for the first quarter was $1,011,000,000, and the total portfolio yield was 4.6%, with both measures increasing compared to the prior year quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011. ","If the results of these limited partnerships had not been reclassified, net investment income would have been $915 million or $67 million less than the first quarter of 2011, driven by the expected reduction in Allstate Financial liabilities. The total portfolio yield would have been 4.3%, consistent with prior year's first quarter but lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. ","On Slide 10, you can see we realized gains of $168 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $72 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. Realized gains in the quarter were primarily from the sale of public equities. Our impairment losses were the lowest recorded since the third quarter of 2007. Derivative results also improved, reflecting a reduced usage of derivatives to manage rate risk and favorable results with respect to our credit position. ","Finally, moving on to Slide 11, we finished the first quarter of 2012 with $19.2 billion in shareholders' equity, an increase of approximately $900 million from year-end 2011. Statutory surplus for both Property-Liability and like remained strong, and deployable asset at the holding company level increased to $2.7 billion at quarter's end. We continued to buy back our stock during the first quarter, repurchasing shares worth $300 million. We now have repurchased $406 million of our $1 billion authorization. We also raised the first quarter dividend at the February board meeting. As Tom mentioned, our book value per share rose to $38.57, a new high for Allstate, 6.6% above year-end 2011. ","Now let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one question on ad spend and Esurance in particular. How are you thinking about advertising there? And is the first quarter kind of an indication whether from a dollars perspective or a kind of combined ratio perspective how you're thinking about Esurance? And just one follow-up.","Thomas J. Wilson","Michael, this is Tom. The -- Don might want to make a comment about the first quarter seasonality Esurance, but let me give you some perspective on sort of how we allocate resources. Each brand stands on its own. So the advertising for the Allstate brand is separate and distinct, and we'll invest whatever we need to do to keep that brand strong and that business growing. The same is true for Esurance. So we look at the economics of those in total. We do not put those together and have a total ad spend budget. We do what we think makes sense. Obviously, we launched a new program in December of last year with Esurance. And along with that, we increased our ad spend, and we like what the have there. Don, you might want to talk a little bit about just first quarter results on Esurance.","Don Civgin","Yes. The -- first of all, Esurance does have a more seasonal business than Allstate, and so their first quarter spend tends to be higher. We spend about $45 million in advertising in the first quarter, and we did that as -- partially, as Tom said, because the launch of the new campaign, the rebranding of Esurance, we wanted to get some weight behind it. I'm happy to say it's working as well as we expected it to. So we're seeing good response rates, good customer mix changes, conversion ratio is improving as we would have expected. So I think, as Tom said, we'll continue to spend money so long as it's economic to do so. And at the moment, it feels like we're spending the right amount, subject to the seasonality of the first quarter.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on Answer Financial, where does that roll into the financial? Is that in other or does that roll into a fee line somewhere? I just wanted to get an idea of where that was and kind of what the magnitude and kind of year-over-year change there was.","Don Civgin","The year-over-year change is minimal, but it's actually very small. But it rolls up into other. So it's not under Esurance.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's in the other line. Okay, great.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Underlying combined ratio in home, high 60s, past 2 quarters. I think that's relative to your longer-term goal of low 60s. So we're not that far away. Would you say the -- you're making progress ahead of plan? Or has the driver just been more benign catastrophe losses the past 2 quarters?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. Mike, this is Matt. I'll try to answer that for you. We had some great product and profit improvement in that line. I'd say about 60% of it was temporary and 40% sustainable. So a large portion was cats and weather x cats. But a significant portion was rates, inspections, correct class actions, the nonrenewal actions and the blocking and tackling that's been done. So I think we're -- I wouldn't say we're ahead of plan or behind plan. I think we are making significant progress about where we thought we'd be, and we feel confident that we're doing the type of fundamental steps necessary to improve the long-term profitability on the business. And we continue a plan that includes rollout of a new homeowners product, house and home, that helps us deal with roof costs specifically. There is some pressure from pricing on roofing. Roof prices fell 2 years in a row from 2008 but had their first increase of 12% in 2011. So we know we have to get out in front of that, and we are with our new product. So we feel pretty confident that fundamentals have helped us dramatically, but it's no denying the fact that first quarter was helped also significantly by just the lack of cats and the weather x cats.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So the 40% was sustainable then. So should we continue to expect high single-digit rate increases in home going to the back half of the year?","Matthew E. Winter","I think that's an acceptable range to think about.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on auto. Can you talk about the competitive environment in auto? And can you also comment on the knock-on effect raising home insurance rates is having on the PIF there?","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Well, obviously, there is an impact of taking homeowners rate actions on not only home but also on our auto customers and our PIF. We're also in places where it's necessary taking rate actions on the auto side, which is compounding that. So when you combine the 2, it's having, what I'd say, is a chilling effect on our ability to grow PIF right now, as we have a core focus on the profitability side. We feel like that's the right balance right now. We believe that growth in the absence of profitability is the wrong strategy. And so we're pretty disciplined right now as far as focusing on getting rate adequate both in homeowners and auto and accepting but not liking the fact that it can impact our ability to grow. The competitive environment is interesting. I think some of the multi-line companies are now raising their homeowners rates a little later than I think we did in some -- a few early adopters. So my expectation is that we will no longer be alone in the marketplace taking rate, that -- now that many of our competitors, even though you may think of them as auto-only competitors, they're offering nonproprietary homeowners products in an attempt to bundle. So even those traditional auto-only companies are getting some of these collateral impact on the raising of homeowners rates. And that's especially true for that market segment, the personal touch loyalists who prefer to bundle their products and aren't looking for independent providers of their individual insurance products.","Thomas J. Wilson","Can I -- let me add to that. I think as you're thinking about growth, really should start with looking at a different customer segments, begin the analysis there, then drop into products. So as Matt just said, the Allstate Agency service those people who want local advice assistance, want branded products by bundles, like bundled product. And so when you're looking at the efforts to maintain homeowner returns, at the same time, you try to grow your auto business and obviously compound that. And of course, we have our issues in New York and Florida. If you look at Esurance, on the other hand, that's the self-serve side of that matrix. You can see that Esurance is growing and competing effectively with GEICO and Progressive. And then if you look on the Encompass side, that was -- we will not turn that business. They've gotten a lot smaller. That was really our issue. We've changed leadership. I don't think we've got it all in the right -- it's headed in the right direction, but we don't have it fixed yet. So I think, really, as we're thinking about growth in the future, it's helpful to set that in the context the way Matt did of who are the customer groups that you're serving and how do you grow within that customer group.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just -- sorry, real quickly. So in terms of Matt said taking rate actions in auto, there's this chart on Slide 5 that shows about 4% rate changes. And then how do I reconcile that with -- in the supplement, Page 18, it shows about 5.5% rate increases in auto.","Matthew E. Winter","I think the -- on Slide 5, you're talking about approved rate changes. And I think in the supplement, it's what's been earned in?","Robert Block","No. The difference is, the 5.8% -- this is Bob -- that you see in the supplement, that's where the -- that's the average of the rates taken in the state specific. What's on the chart is the 4 quarter moving countrywide impact of rates. So they're 2 different numbers.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So would the supplement be kind of a more leading indicator that you're accelerating?","Robert Block","No. If you took the 4 quarters of the supplement for the countrywide, you'd get the 4%. And add them up, you'd get close to 4%.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","On the auto, I thought the frequency and the severity trends in total were quite benign. And with Progressive's commentary and GEICO reporting over 100, there's some nervousness about what's going on in auto. I mean, you've been reporting steady 7 to 8 points better than the industry, auto underwriting and contracting. I'm just trying to understand the difference between what you're seeing and they're seeing. I'm wondering if the fact that they're growing much more rapidly and you're contracting could be feeding into it.","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, this is Tom. It's hard to comment on what other people's results are. I mean, obviously, I think Progressive got hit with some reserve changes that they had to make down in Florida. I can't speak to GEICO since they're not -- they don't publicly disclose all the stuff that you can really go over. I would say, when you look at our practices in auto insurance, we pay attention to it at a very local level. We have good operating discipline around it. We're watching the trends. You see that the countrywide ones, the frequency is down, but a lot of frequency is down because of New York and Florida. So we're looking at a level below that. Matt and his team are on top of that, so they have a number of places where they are managing rate. That's why you see some -- 10 states had some increases. So we believe in small frequent adjustments rather than large and infrequent in terms of managing our business from a customer standpoint.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Just a bookkeeping question. You have $4.6 billion of limited partnerships. What's the amount of that, that's impacted by the EMA geography change?","Thomas J. Wilson","About 60% of that is impacted by the EMA. I think it's about $2.5 billion.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","And the split between PC and life of those 2?","Thomas J. Wilson","PC is about 2\/3, life is about 1\/3. You can see that in the underlying numbers. In the 10-Q, we have those splits.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","PC is bigger?","Thomas J. Wilson","PC is bigger. Yes.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Looking at the policy count to client in homeowners, it was negative $110,000. And I want to know, where are you in reshaping the homeowners portfolio through risk management and price increases? How many years until we get to stability? And I also noticed that the decline in auto was a little higher but about the same. Is it possible that Allstate's begun to grow in unbundled homeowners policies?","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, you broke up on a few of those, but -- so -- but I think we got it. Matt, do you want to...","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, I think I heard enough. If I start answering a different question than you asked, please [indiscernible].","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I can ask again if you want. Look, you guys can take it for what you want, and I'll steer you if I get misdirected.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay, good.","Matthew E. Winter","Okay. Now I lost my train of thought on what your original question of the...","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Homeowners reshaping the portfolio, where are we in the long-term process? And are you growing in unbundled auto at this time?","Matthew E. Winter","Okay. So I don't think it's prudent for me to guess a percentage of how far we are along in our path. I would say we've made significant progress in taking a look at our homeowners offerings on a state-by-state and region-by-region and even locality basis to determine where we believe we have long-term prospects of making an acceptable return for the acceptable level of risk. And we began that process and have done a great deal of work there. As a result, we're making decisions about those areas where we will begin offering nonproprietary homeowners products and brokering products so that we can serve our customers with a complete portfolio but not necessarily always with an Allstate-branded product. And so we are doing a fair amount of work in our brokering operation and on our E&S segment to take a look at more, I'd say, more of a refined view of looking at our markets and determining what product should be offered where. That takes some time. It takes some time to build up the brokering capability, to build up the linkages from a technology standpoint so we can serve those customers the same way we would serve customers with our Allstate-branded product. And we are, I think, making excellent progress there. To your unbundled question, look, homeowners is often the lead product in our marketplaces. In some areas, it is their #1 go-to customer product and then they follow with auto. It is possible that we are seeing some areas where they're getting homeowners products, and for whatever reason, we do not then get to follow on auto. But our focus and our incentives and our goal is to provide a bundled product offering, deep relationship with multi-products to our customers, so they can get the true full value of working with an Allstate agent.","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, this is Tom. Maybe to give you a little longer-term perspective, too. In 2005, I think it was after Katrina, we looked and said, \"Should we get out of the business?\" And we broke it into 3 buckets: one was make it cats, hurricanes and earthquakes; two was non-model cats; and three was just sort of the normal slip, fall, low severity, high-frequency events. And so we went off at all -- we went at all 3 of those components. We went first at the cat thing. I would say we made tremendous progress here, and we're pretty close to being where we want to be. But there are a few states where we still got some more work to do. But we like what we've done in Florida, what we've done around the coast. We're down over 1 million policies in homeowners as a result of many of those changes. The second piece was non-model cats. That's the part that popped really in '08, '09, '10 and '11. And as Matt said, we've been hard at work on that for the last 3 years, and I totally agree that it's hard to predict when that one will be done because you got to figure out what the weather will be in the future. And then the third piece was just the normal slips and falls. And we got a little behind in '08, '09 as cost increases due to commodity prices and oil prices spiking in those periods. Our actual underlying severities on non-catastrophe-related stuff went up. So I feel like we've made a lot of progress on that piece, too. So I would say #1 and #3, we're pretty far along, and #2, a little harder to sort out. About 75% or so of our homeowners business that's written comes with another product. So we're not there. That said, we'd like -- as Matt said, we'd like it to be a lead line. When Matt and his team get this -- get house and home rolled out, get the pricing right, we believe that being a provider of a wide variety of products for that personal touch loyalist customer who likes to bundle stuff will be a competitive advantage for us.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And quickly on Florida and New York. The loss ratios were off the charts. Have you overshot the mark in terms of your -- trying to get profits out of there at the expense of new customers?","Matthew E. Winter","No, I don't believe we've overshot the mark. I think that those 2 markets are obviously extremely volatile and extremely difficult. We have challenges there on the regulatory and legislative side. We have some challenges in some of the PIF trends. We've taken firm and decisive action there. I do not believe we've overreacted there. We're trying to reposition and stabilize and ensure that when we begin growing, that it is all profitable growth. And so I actually think the team and the agents in those 2 regions have done exceptionally well in managing through very difficult circumstances and still maintaining good customer relationships and good customer satisfaction. So I don't feel like we've overshot the target. I think that we're -- we've hit pretty much a bull's-eye on both of those, and we'll continue our efforts in a careful, disciplined way.","Thomas J. Wilson","And there were some reserve changes, too.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk about -- excuse me, 2 issues, first, in Allstate brand standard auto have. How much time do you think it will take to turn the corner to get to flat on PIF? And then my second question is on Esurance, with the 128 combined ratio and about a $50 million underwriting loss. I'm just trying to get a sense of when you feel we might see signs of improvement there and maybe even heading towards breakeven on the underwriting front.","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, we don't want to do forecast of growth, so we're working our way through it. Unfortunately, I'm not going to give an answer on when we expect that to turn, but we are obviously hard at work. Matt's team segment said we do provide some information on where we're growing outside of areas where we have big challenges, like New York and Florida. On Esurance, there's a bunch of our purchase accounting stuff in there, so the combined ratio is really 106 when you strip out all the other stuff. And we do provide -- we added a new sheet to the investor supplement which has the loss ratio in it, which should be able to give you the -- a bill, which is Page 26. And you can -- we show in there the loss ratio, and you can see the loss ratio is down at 73. And then you can look at the -- what we spend in marketing, and you could do some estimates. We do that so that you can see that we believe this is -- we're riding it at an economic rate, that we're not just growing and funding by giving the business away.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How long does that amortization expense continue on the Esurance business?","Robert Block","Less than 5 years.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the PIF, I understand where you're coming from. Can you -- I don't know if you disclosed what the auto -- Allstate brand standard auto PIF change would have been, say, x New York and Florida or x the underwriting actions taken in homeowners.","Thomas J. Wilson","You can see the first piece, you can't see the second piece. But you should assume that Matt has depth and understanding behind his comment that in those places where we take homeowner rates above 10%, we have growth challenges in those places where it's less than 10%, and we feel pretty good about our business.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, the only thing I'd add, Jay, is it gets lost here, but we did grow auto at year-over-year first quarter in 24 states. So a lot of what you see is an aggregation, driven by a couple of large states with a lot of rate action taking place there that is causing a decline.","Operator","The next question is from Alison Jacobowitz of Bank of America.","Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been touched on, but I was wondering if you could talk some maybe about some of the smaller operations you have like Encompass and maybe the non-standard side. Is there any opportunities there to turn things more dramatically around?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll start with, what we would call, Alison -- I'll start with what we would label as our emerging businesses. Don might want to talk a little bit about some further growth in Esurance, other things we can do there. Matt can talk about non-standard, because there's a number of places we are pushing on growth. And coming back to our customers, we do believe that our customers want to buy in the Allstate channel a wide variety of products. So we're doing quite well in motorcycles right now. We need to do better in a wider variety of stuff. We're doing great in Good Hands Roadside, which is our \"pay as you go\" roadside thing that we launched on a national basis as part of Grow to Win last year. And so that business has, what we would call, consumer household business, and our motor club business are doing well. We think we can continue to accelerate growth in those areas. Encompass is -- when you look at over the last 4 years, Encompass is a significant portion of the decline we have in total premiums. We did not properly position that business in that channel, which are people who want local advice but are less concerned about who the company is, and they tend to be a little more price sensitive. So our -- we got the wrong business, we got it through the wrong agency owners. We've repositioned that business. You see a small growth in that business in the first quarter of this year. I'm not satisfied that we have that completely positioned yet to grow. They have more work to do, but we believe there's upside there because if we just get back what we lost, we'll pick up about $700 million or $800 million premium. So that's a good growth. Don, I don't know if you want to talk about potential to add products to Esurance and the positioning of the risk profile in terms of preferred. And then, Don, maybe you can go to non-standard and then if you want to say anything else.","Don Civgin","Yes, Alison, it's Don Civgin. We've only had Esurance for one full quarter now. But I would tell you, I think we are just as happy as the day we made the announcement, if not more at this point when we look at what the opportunity -- the breakout opportunity to your question is with Esurance. A lot of good things are taking place. The integration is going quite well. Some of that is going to be efforts to reduce costs so that we're taking advantage of scale and process improvements and claims. Contract renegotiations have been very fruitful as well. Tom's right, I think we're looking at launching a series of new additional products for Esurance, increasing the number of states that they will be operating in, because if you recall, when we acquired them, they were not in all 50 states. And we are adding the benefit of our kind of deep pricing knowledge, particularly as it relates to our customer segment just a little bit different than theirs. So none of that's rolled out yet. It's all going to be part of the customer value proposition over the next year or 2 as it grows. But I would tell you, even in the first quarter -- now we don't report year-over-year results because we didn't own them a year ago. But if you look at their gross written premium compared to when White Mountains reported them last year, they're up 6.5% in the first quarter. So that's the result of some advertising and a new campaign and so forth. But when you ask us their breakout opportunity, I think there's a substantial opportunity for Esurance as they build the value proposition around their customer.","Matthew E. Winter","This is Matt, Alison. I'll touch on non-standard a little bit. We've shown a slight improvement in new business over the prior year. We stabilized the Allstate blue states, and we've had a little bit of a surging new business in the non-Allstate blue states. But nevertheless, those 30-day retention continues to decline, and our items in force continue to decline. We've slowed that down a little bit. I've asked our group to take a very long, hard look at ways of getting more substantially back in, what I'll call, the near non-standard or the near standard niche here, possibly not the full non-standard all the way down market, but those borderline cases. And so we will do a fair amount of work over the next 3 to 6 months to assess our opportunity there. It's an area that I think has great long-term potential if done right. And if done in a disciplined, careful manner, which includes some variations on the business model and how you bill and how some of the underwriting rules are executed, and so I see it as a growth opportunity that we should be very careful about how we tap into so that we do it right. Because as I said before, growth without the profitability could destroy shareholder value, and we're about building shareholder value.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Johnson of Citadel.","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Maybe could you put around a little more insight into the alternative asset strategy that you've moved the accounting a little bit on? Just tell us a little bit about how big and what you're interested in doing there, and then maybe just an update on the agent consolidation strategy. Can you throw us some numbers in terms of where you're at on that?","Judith Pepple Greffin","So, Dan, it's Judy Greffin. And I can talk a little bit about what we're doing in alternative and private assets. So if you think about where we are today, we have a mix of private equity, private real estates, real assets and infrastructure, as well as hedge funds. And we've had a long-standing program in private equity. We continue and expect to have a long-standing program in private equity, don't expect that one to grow that much over the next 12 to 24 months. Private real estate and real assets and infrastructure, though, we are growing those. We look at those as an opportunity to own some good assets, as well as assets that generate some cash flow. So we look at that and say, \"That's a nice alternative in this low rate environment, selling some assets directly.\" And then within hedge funds, we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds and expect that we'll look at that more opportunistically into the future. So that is the total of those assets. And the reason why we're increasing the real assets and real estate, really has to do with not just the low interest rate environment but also the strategy for Allstate Financial, which we talked about earlier. And we look at those assets as a nice fit to our long-dated liabilities and see that as a long-term asset choice for us.","Steven E. Shebik","Dan, this is Steve. What Judy has described is really the reason we moved the EMA income from realized capital gains up to the net [ph] investment income. It's really much more closely aligned with our operating income than it has been for the last several years.","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Do we have the historical data set on that, like if we went back into the AOCI or something, can we see the sort of earnings that have generated from those assets?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, you can see that in the investor supplement and the 10-Qs going back by year and by quarter.","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Great. And Judy, in terms of sort of new money yields on more traditional fixed income investments, what are we seeing today versus the average yields?","Judith Pepple Greffin","So our new money proxies for the property and casualty portfolio, which we keep around a 5-year, it's around 2.75. New money proxy for Allstate Financial was a little bit longer. It's around 3.5.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Dan, I'll make an overall comment on the agency consolidation, and Matt might want to talk about some things he has going on. First, the agency consolidation makes it sound like we don't want everybody. Everybody counts. You can be a big agency, you can be a middle agency, you can be a new agency. We are seeking to have all of them be more successful on behalf of our agency -- of our customers. And so we have programs around there. I think the net of that is, some people have chosen to leave, so we have a fewer. But it's not as -- it's not like we're trying to get rid of a certain class of agencies. If you're taking care of our customers who are happy, we have to help you, support you, because bigger agencies do have more capabilities. So we're helping build [indiscernible] going to help build the efforts for the capabilities for other agencies as well. Matt, maybe you want to talk about some of that.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. So at a high level, there's such a diversity in markets and geographies that we cover that having some artificial numbers about what is the appropriate size agency just makes no sense in a system like ours. So what we're all about doing, and what Tom was referring to, is creating an economically viable agency that's able to appropriately serve their customers and grow and develop so that these are vibrant businesses that are really serving Allstate customers the way they deserve to be served. And so we're allowing the economics of the system to drive things. And so in a lot of cases, we have smaller agencies that see a path to getting to the right size for them and their geography to be supportable. And we're helping them every step of the way, and we'd love them to grow. So we don't really have, in my opinion, an agency consolidation strategy. We have an agency help strategy to help all of our agencies become vibrant, economically self-sufficient and capable of serving customers. Next week, in Las Vegas, we have a conference. We have opened up that conference. It was typically a recognition conference for people who achieved a certain level of production. We've opened it up to additional non-qualifiers who are paying their own way to go there. And we have over 4,000 attendees from agency owners and exclusive financial specialists who have attended, of which 44% of them are paying their -- I'm sorry, 44% of them, this will be their first national conference of any type, which is very powerful. It's an opportunity for people who have not achieved levels of success that would have allowed them to attend a recognition conference before, be around people who have and learn best practices from their peers and colleagues, exchange ideas in how to approach and serve the marketplace. And so we're really excited about that. And we, in fact, have workshops and seminars available for every size agency there to help them all be successful. So I think we did a bad job previously on explaining our strategy, if you think of it as a consolidation strategy because I don't think...","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Yes, I apologize for belaboring the question. I thought the idea was to bring larger scale to the agencies to help drive a customer satisfaction, which had waned a bit but also basically economic efficiencies.","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, that is true, Dan. And certainly, the bigger they are, the better and easier to do that. But I think what got lost in that translation was we can do some of that centrally for our agencies, so that even if you only have 1,800 accounts, we can make you look and feel like a 3,000-account agency.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","My question is around buybacks. You're obviously making more money. You have additional debt capacity, and the life exposures are shrinking. What's the possibility to accelerate the current buyback? And longer term, what's the potential to actually increase the level of buyback?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, I think if you look at our track record, you can see if we don't have a good use of the capital, we give back to shareholders. This -- we do see -- you're correct in saying this is an accelerated pace on this one, this billion dollar program, which should be done by February '13. And we're obviously ahead of pace on that. We saw the stock was so cheap, we just thought we ought to be buying it back faster so, we rushed and did it. We're making good money, we still have -- when we get done with this authorization, then we'll figure out where we're going next.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one quick follow-up. You show that Texas auto loss ratio popped up. Is that tornadoes, or is there some other issue in Texas?","Matthew E. Winter","It's cats and weather. It's tornadoes, it's hail, and it's actually rain in some areas.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Straus of Schroders.","Alan Straus","Yes. Given the powerful cash flow, is the notion of issuing the preferred off the table again? Or is it still out there and you're thinking about it?","Thomas J. Wilson","Alan, this is Tom. When we announced the billion dollar share repurchase, we said there were 3 places we would source the capital from. First was we had a deployable capital at the holding company level. Second, we said we obviously will have earnings. And we said if those are not enough, then we will issue the preferred. Obviously, given what's happened with earnings, we haven't seen the need to do that, so we're -- we don't feel like we need to issue it at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Just 2, if I may. The other personal line segment, Tom, the combined x cats, x development, it was the best in, I think, 5 years. Can you just talk about what went on in that line? And then do you know just is that trendable, or were there some onetime benefits?","Thomas J. Wilson","Overall personal line?","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","The other personal line segments, so the non-auto, non-home.","Thomas J. Wilson","Other personal line. I would say 1 quarter does not make -- they had a good quarter. I think we -- but there are some portions of that business that are not operating as well as we would like them to be, so for example, in there, you have manufactured housing and a few other things, so -- which were not yet well priced on. We have some businesses that we like a lot, so there's 7 or 8 things. They're headed in the right direction. Last year, we had an underwriting loss on those businesses in large part because of catastrophes. But even when you exclude catastrophes, we thought we could run a higher profit margin in those businesses, given where the competitors are. And so we have some work to do still. But we feel good. They had a good quarter, so we're happy about it.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Any particular lines that drove the performance, motorcycles or commercial or anything like that? Or was it kind of broad-based?","Thomas J. Wilson","No, it's pretty broad-based.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay, great. And then just one other one. On the idea of turning around the PIF, and honestly, I'm not trying to pin you down on a number or timing. But just sort of what initiatives are going to drive it? Obviously, you talked a little bit about the agency issues and -- but beyond that, I mean, are New York and Florida now able to start growing? Are they fixed enough where you feel like you can start turning up the market support there? I think you mentioned in your prior meeting about expanding the bull's-eye a little bit, I guess, to try to target some more customers who maybe haven't been a good price PIF before. What are sort of the initiatives that we're going to see? When PIF gets better, what are going to be the reasons?","Thomas J. Wilson","I would say, Matt and his team have a whole variety of initiatives going on relative to growth, most of which you've talked about. The one that is not -- we haven't spent as much time talking about either on the positive or negative side is retention. And part of Grow to Win, which I think I've mischaracterized publicly, Grow to Win was really a one task of component of our overall business strategy. And then we had more marketing programs for customers. We wanted to launch Good Hands Roadside on a national basis, we wanted to do a number of local programs to engage agencies in growth. And we had a program focused on retention, which we had our employees calling out on behalf of the agencies. We called 1 million customers. And so the retention part is something that we're hard at work on. It's a little difficult when you're doing things like New York and Florida and you're raising homeowner rates to get overall retention, but I would say that's the other part of our growth program, which you didn't mention, and then Matt talked about non-standard. I don't know if there's anything else you want to add.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, I guess you mentioned broadening the target, and in fact, we are rolling out some refinements to our auto pricing state-by-state that will have the impact of broadening the target in the first state that it rolled out in, the first pilot. It improved close rates by just over 2 percentage points. So that was very encouraging. We have a carefully thought-out rollout plan for this year of -- about capability. Don't forget, we also have Claim Satisfaction Guarantee that's being rolled out. We have a tremendous number of initiatives. We're trying not to overwhelm the field with initiatives, yet provide growth-oriented initiatives where they're most needed. And my firm belief is, as the need for taking rate and doing reinspections and rate reclassifications, et cetera, diminishes, it will free up agent time and the agent capacity to focus on the things they like doing the most, which is growing and serving their customers. So we feel like the trend line is good. It's hard to tell you exactly when we're \"ready to grow\" in New York and Florida, but we're on the right path.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Matt, does it feel this is a particularly good time to be broadening that appetite, given 2 of your largest competitors seem to be pulling back a little bit due to their margin issues?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On the homeowners, we've seen a decline in frequency and severity. How much of that was because of the underwriting actions you've taken? And can we expect to see that in the future?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, Vinay, I mentioned earlier that whether it's 60-40 or 50-50, some percentage is temporary due to weather in cats and some is very sustainable due to rates, inspections, correct class actions, non-renewals, the actions we're taking to ensure that we're increasing, what I'd call, the underwriting muscle in that line. And so I think it's very sustainable, and I think we're feeling very good about it.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's great. Just a follow-up for New York and Florida personal auto. Those states seem to be fixed. When do you think that you guys can start having a flatter PIF growth in those 2 states?","Thomas J. Wilson","Everyone keeps circling around this one. If you look at the business model and the way it renews and the way the customer flows work, it takes a while to overcome declines in retention and declines in the new business. So I don't think you should expect to see those turn around soon. We're obviously working on them. They're different in each market. Florida's got some new legislation passed, although it's also got some pricing components to that, so we're kind of watching that one closely. New York, we feel good about the operational position, wherein it's a little less fluid in terms of being able to adjust if you don't have it quite right. And we have a relatively sizable decline in both retention and new business here. Now we've rolled out some new pricing in New York. But -- so we're about growing in the right way, but I don't think you should expect to see us start talking about growth, including New York and Florida being up in the near term.","Operator","Our final question today is from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'll just be a quick one here for you all. On the paid severities going on in the quarter, I know last year -- last quarter, you talked about used car parts and replacement [ph] causing that to kind of move up. Is that still the case? And do you think that's going to continue here for another couple quarters, or is it kind of an aberration here?","Matthew E. Winter","This is Matt, Brian. Well, yes, we saw the third consecutive month that the Manheim Index showed an increase in used car prices. So, in fact, every month of that quarter, we saw an increase in used car prices, which certainly drove some of it. We also remember had a very good weather quarter, which decreased the number of small fender benders. So the accidents that occurred tended to be the larger ones not related to weather. And I'd say that's the predominant piece. BI is moving along with the relevant index, the medical CPI. And PIP is within our expectations. So the thing that we're pretty focused on is PD severity. Frequency looks relatively benign with gasoline prices and the continued benefits from New York and Florida.","Thomas J. Wilson","Brian, this is Tom. If you want to look at used car prices over a longer period of time, there are some measures out there, and what you would see is from sort of 1999 to 2009, they kind of were down to slightly flat over that entire 10-year period, which, of course, happen to coincide with massive amounts of new car production sales in the United States. Of course, then in '09, when new car sales went way down, then you saw the opposite. So you could [indiscernible]. Our job is not to predict that but is to react to it, and that's exactly what Matt's team is doing. ","Okay. Well, thank you, all, for joining us today. We're off to a good start in 2012, but we obviously have more work ahead of us this year. But we do have our 4 priorities we're focusing on, which is maintain auto profitability, raise returns in homeowners and annuity businesses, grow insurance premiums and then proactively manage our investments and capital. Successful execution of those will keep driving shareholder value up. Thank you, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Steve Shebik, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Steven E. Shebik","Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and me, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter 2013 and posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012, our 10-Q for the third quarter and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. We're recording this call, and a replay will be available following the conclusion of the call. We'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning, and thanks for investing your time with us. I'll start by covering the third quarter results, as they relate to our strategy and then our 2013 priorities. Now Bob Block is not with us today. He's attending to a health issue. So Steve will cover both the business performance and capital sections of the presentation. Also today -- with us here today are Matt Winter, who, of course, leads Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, who is responsible for Allstate Financial and Esurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Don Bailey, who leads the Emerging businesses; and then Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Now if you look at the quarter in total, we generated very strong results. It really reflects the broad and comprehensive approach we've taken to creating shareholder value. Operating income was strong, and we made progress on all of our 2013 operating priorities.","Growth improved, and we made progress on balancing risk and return and deploying capital to enhance returns. Starting with Slide 2. It summarizes our third quarter results. Revenues increased to $8.5 billion, which is up 4.1%. That reflects a 5.3% growth in net written premium with contributions from all of the customer segments and businesses. Net income of $310 million declined from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the $475 million after-tax loss from the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Operating income of $713 million was essentially equal to the last year's third quarter, while operating income per diluted share increased as a result of our share repurchase program. Our book value per common share increased both with and without fixed income on realized gains and losses.","On Slide 3, we show the 4 distinct customer segments that drive our competitively differentiated approach to the market, and our results in each. The 3 brands where we underwrite risk, that's Allstate, Encompass and Esurance, all grew net written premium. Answer Financial also increased its nonproprietary premium. Now for The Allstate brand, which serves customers who prefer local advice, assistance and a branded experience, policies declined by 0.4% from the prior year quarter, as growth in standard auto was offset by continued reductions in homeowner policies.","Allstate brand's standard auto policies increased 1.1% versus 1 year ago and 0.6% versus last quarter, reflecting continued improved retention and strong new business growth. We've made substantial progress in improving returns in homeowners, and as a result, the decline in homeowners policies has lessened. Total homeowner policies declined by 3.2% from a year ago, and 0.3% versus last quarter. We're beginning to take steps to position this line, as a competitive -- so it becomes a competitive advantage for us as opposed to a drag on overall growth. Actions taken to position high-performing agencies for success, including more effective compensation programs, is also working, and agencies are expanding. The profitability improvement in this segment with a combined ratio of 86.4 and an underlying combined ratio of 85.4. The Esurance brand, which is in the lower right, serves the self-directed brand-sensitive customer, and continues to generate significant premium in unit growth as it successfully leverages the benefits of being part of Allstate. Increased advertising that's more effective, better pricing for preferred risk auto customers and improved claim practices are designed to acquire and retain profitable lifetime value customers.","The combined ratio remained high at 116.8, in part, reflecting the high levels of marketing spend, the expensing of acquisition intangibles and the impact of higher loss ratios on new business. The Esurance team is working to adjust pricing underwriting to ensure that this growth will generate long-term profitability. These actions caused growth to decelerate in the third quarter, if you look from month-to-month, and we expect growth to decline somewhat in 2014. The Encompass brand, which is in the upper left, serves consumers who want local advice but a choice of products and services. That continue to show positive growth of policies, up 7.2% compared to the prior year quarter.","Strategically, we remained focused on household penetration with our unique package product that represents about 75% of Encompass' volume. The combined ratio on the quarter was 93.6, an improvement of 6 points from the prior year quarter, with an underlying combined ratio 92.5. The improvement in the combined ratio reflects a favorable reserve reestimate.","On Slide 4, we show a progress report on our 5 2013 operating priorities. I've already covered the Grow Insurance Premiums priority for property-liability, and that's the first 5 sub bullets there. Allstate Financial's premiums and contract charges also increased by 3.7% over the third quarter of 2012. The growth in premiums and contract charges for underwritten products was 4.4%, with Allstate Benefits growing approximately 10% compared to the prior year quarter.","Our second priority is to maintain auto profitability. The Allstate brand had a standard auto combined ratio of 94.9, which was 3 points higher than last year's third quarter due to lower favorable reserve reestimates. When you look at the underlying combined ratio, it was 94.6, which is 0.9 points higher than the prior quarter. That increase reflects a modest increase in frequency and severity and a higher expense ratio, which is offset in part by higher average premiums. Esurance and Encompass had a combined ratio improvement in the quarter when compared to the prior year quarter, but more work is required to improve returns on these 2 brands. Our third priority is to focus on returns in homeowners and annuities. We continue to make progress on raising returns in homeowners with an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 65.3, with an underlying combined ratio of 61.8, which is 4.4 points better than the prior quarter. With the underlying combined ratios tracking towards the low 60s for the last several quarters, we believe we are now positioned to focus on building a sustainable competitive advantage in homeowners. Annuity returns improved in the quarter, but the long-term outlook is still challenged by low interest rates. Given our favorable strong underlying results for the quarter, it's reasonable to ask if we'll end the year below our 2013 annual outlook of 88 to 90. We believe the annual outlooks are the appropriate way to manage expectations of profitability, so we're not providing a change to the range for just the fourth quarter. We will announce an outlook range for 2014 when we report the full results for this year.","Our fourth goal is to proactively manage investment. Net investment income benefited from higher income on investments and limited partnerships in the quarter. We continue to position the property-liability portfolio with a shorter duration to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, and Steve will take you through some graphs that make that very clear. And while this action generates current capital gains and lowers our risk profile, it obviously reduces the portfolio yield and future operating income.","Total returns for the quarter was 1% on modestly higher net investment income and really minimal changes in the overall valuation of the portfolio. Now the fifth priority is to reduce our cost structure, so we can give customers greater value with a differentiated offering. During the quarter, we reduced the cost structure through simplification and process improvement initiatives. We also restructured our employee and retiree benefit programs to make benefits more consistent amongst employees and adjusted current market practices.","Our property-liability expense ratio increased in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, but has sequentially improved since the first quarter of this year. Investments are being made in technology and to expand Esurance's geographic and product footprint. Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Tom. On Slide 5, we provide financial highlights for Property-Liability and Allstate Financial. Property-liability had earned premium of $7.0 billion, which grew 4.1% from the third quarter of 2012, with a combined ratio of 90.0. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.9, 0.9 points better than Q3 2012. And the year-to-date underlying combined ratio was 87.2, better than our full year outlook range.","Catastrophe losses were $128 million, $78 million below the third quarter of 2012, and the lowest third quarter losses since 2002. As a result, net income was $656 million in third quarter, 2.7% higher than the prior year quarter. The combined ratios on a recorded and underlying basis for each brand are shown on the right side of the exhibit. The Allstate brand continues to generate solid profitability, as the positive effects of rate changes and low catastrophe losses more than offset the modest increases in loss cost.","The Encompass recorded combined ratio for the quarter improved from the prior year quarter, reflecting favorable reserve reestimates. The Esurance combined ratio of 116.8 improved 1.7 points from the prior year quarter; however, it remained elevated, as Tom noted. Allstate Financial, on the bottom left, had a 3.7% increase in premiums and contract charges in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year, helped by underwritten products increasing 4.4%, including an approximately 10% increase for Allstate Benefits. The benefit spread declined in the quarter due to an increase in reserves related to our annual review of reserve assumptions, partially offset by improved mortality in life insurance. The investment spread decline reflects a $169 million pretax gain in the prior year associated with updating input used in the valuation of certain embedded derivatives. Operating income, which excludes this gain, improved 30.9% from the prior year quarter due to lower credit interest on spread-based liabilities and improved mortality in life insurance, partially offset by a higher charge associated with our annual comprehensive review of DAC and reserve assumptions. The net loss was $360 million in the quarter due to the loss on the pending disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life.","On Slide 6, we provide net written premium and policies in force trends by brand and in total. For total Property-Liability, in the upper left, net written premium increased 5.3% from the third quarter of 2012, and overall policies grew 0.8%. Our strategy to provide unique products and services to distinct consumer segments is working, as both net written premium and policies grew for each brand compared to last quarter.","Moving to the upper right chart. Total Allstate brand grew as standard auto net written premium increased 3.3% from prior year, while policies increased 1.1% compared to the third quarter of 2012, and 0.6% compared to last quarter. Allstate brand's homeowners net written premium grew 5.5%, while unit volume declined at a slower rate than last quarter. The results for both of these lines reflect favorable trends in retention and new business.","On the bottom 2 charts, you can see the growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Both continue to grow compared to the prior year quarter, in both written premium and policies. While growth trends have improved, we've maintained overall margins.","On Slide 7, the charts on the left side of the slide show the earned premium and loss per policy trends, while the charts on the right-hand side show the combined ratio trends.","For standard auto, losses per policy increased at a rate just slightly higher than the earned premium per policy, as you can see in the upper left, where the blue line is above the red line. Essentially, moderate increases in frequencies and severities were offset by rate increases. The combined ratio for standard auto remained consistently profitable, as shown in the upper-right chart, where the red bar is generally around the 95 combined ratio.","For Allstate brand homeowners, shown in the bottom half of the slide, loss cost per policy decreased, while earned premium per policy increased; with the blue line substantially below the red premium line. These resulted in an improvement in underlying combined ratio of 4.4 points to 61.8. The recorded combined ratio for the quarter was 65.3, a 7.6-point improvement from the prior year quarter, reflecting the improved underlying margin and lower catastrophes. The combined ratio trends are shown in the lower right-hand chart, and you can see our underlying 12-month average is about 63, the lowest point in all quarters shown.","On Slide 8, third quarter investment results reflect actions we have taken to reduce interest rate risk in our Property-Liability portfolio, maintain alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile and reposition our public equity portfolio. The carrying value of our portfolio totaled $80.5 billion compared to $97.3 billion at year end. The decline is primarily in our core debt portfolio, reflecting the $12.2 billion reclassification of Lincoln Benefit Life's investments to \"held for sale\" due to LBL's pending sale, as well as lower fixed income valuations driven by a significant rise in interest rates since the beginning of the year.","The equity and owned component of our portfolio continues to grow. We expect to earn higher but more variable returns over time on this part of our portfolio. On the top of Slide 8, you can see net investment income totaled $950 million in the third quarter and total portfolio yield is 4.5%, both below prior quarter but better than the third quarter of 2012. Low reinvestment yields and a smaller asset base driven by reductions in Allstate Financial's spread-based liability, resulted in lower income in our core debt portfolio. The decline was partially mitigated by $36 million in prepayment fees and litigation proceeds. Our equity and owned portfolio continued to benefit from strong limited partnership earnings, which increased by $84 million compared to the prior year quarter, and more than offset the decline in the core debt portfolio income.","At September 30, 2013, limited partnership valuation included approximately $400 million of cumulative appreciation that have been recognized in our income, but has not been distributed. This amount is carried on our balance sheet as an asset, but is subject to variability in the ultimate realization. If cash proceeds are less than its valuation, it will negatively impact future operating income.","Moving to total return. The total return for the quarter was 1.0%. Net investment income was a primary driver, as treasury rates were relatively stable for the quarter. And attribution of the change in net unrealized capital gains for the first 3 quarters of the year is provided on the bottom-right of the slide. The fixed income valuation decline driven by a significant increase in treasury rates was the overwhelming driver of a $2.7 billion decline in unrealized gains for the first half of the year.","For the third quarter, positive equity valuations and realized loss activity offset the impact of the additional modest declines in fixed income valuations, as the net unrealized position held relatively steady.","Slide 9 depicts trends in our Property-Liability in Allstate Financial portfolio, separately. You can see a declining earned yield trend on our Property-Liability core debt, in a graph at the top left, reflecting maturity reinvestments and our ongoing risk-reduction activity. Through our rate risk-reduction actions, we have positioned the portfolio to be less sensitive to an increase in interest rates, and have pulled forward our future income through the realization of gains and the sale of longer-term securities. In a scheduled maturity graph in the upper right, the 2 declining red bars at the longest maturities represent that only -- reflect that only 15% of our current portfolio is due after 7 years versus 32% at the end of last year. The current yield on intermediate corporates, which is our targeted reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1.75% to 2%. Given the shortfall relative to the portfolio yield, maturity and sales activities have and are expected to continue to result in a decline in net investment income for the core debt portfolio.","At the bottom of the page, you can see that Allstate Financial's net investments income has declined as a result of the managed reduction of the spread-based liabilities, a trend that will be accelerated with the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Over the past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows rather than being reinvested. So the portfolio yield has not declined as much as the Property-Liability portfolio. Further, our future investment income will continue to be impacted by the pace of the liability outflows and reinvestment activity. The exhibit provides a pro forma view of portfolio results exclusive of LBL-related assets.","As you can see in the -- on the bottom-left chart, in the last column in the table, the core debt portfolio yield remains essentially unchanged around 5%, but the investment income is approximately $140 million lower, excluding the LBL-related assets. The chart on the bottom right shows the ongoing decline in the Allstate Financial portfolio, as we continue to reduce spread-based liabilities.","Moving on to Slide 10, we provide a roadmap of items that impacted the results this quarter. Last quarter, we announced the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which is a business serving customers in the upper-left customer quadrant with life and annuity products who did not have a competitive advantage. Lincoln Benefit Life is treated as held-for-sale beginning this quarter, with its assets and liabilities collapsed into separate lines on the balance sheet. We estimated $475 million after tax loss on sale, as recorded in Loss on Disposition on our income statement. We expect this transaction to close early in the first quarter of 2014 subject to regulatory approval.","After closing, we'll have lower financial risk, and additional deployable capital of approximately $1 billion. This capital will be freed up in Allstate Life Insurance Company, and a number of steps will be necessary for us to move into the parent company, post closing.","As discussed last quarter, we made changes to our pension and postretirement benefits, which caused the liabilities to be remeasured in July. This resulted in a change in our liabilities; favorably impacted shareholder's equity by $658 million; a curtailment gain related to changes in our retiree life favorably impacted net income by $118 million; and a pension settlement charge included operating income of $49 million. We'll also perform an annual remeasurement of our pension liability during the fourth quarter and are likely to have additional settlement losses of a similar or greater magnitude at that time.","Our annual review of the discontinued lines of coverage reserves resulted in a negative after-tax impact totaling $86 million compared to a negative impact last year of $25 million. This year's review resulted in a pretax increase to asbestos reserves of $74 million, and of our metal reserves of $30 million, and other exposures at $30 million.","I've already mentioned our annual comprehensive review of DAC and reserve assumptions at Allstate Financial, which negatively impacted operating income by $44 million this year compared to a negative impact of $21 million last year. Slide 11 shows our capital position at September 30 compared to the same period a year ago. We remain in a strong capital position at the end of the third quarter. This quarter, we returned $608 million to shareholders. We repurchased 2.1% of our outstanding stock or 9.8 million shares, compared to $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. We have $589 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","As we continue to execute our capital management plan, our balance sheet has changed, as we have previously described. We issued $800 million of subordinated hybrid debt and $385 million of perpetual preferred stock in the third quarter, bringing our total preferred stock to $673 million. Our estimated statutory surplus at September 30, 2013, is $17.3 billion in total, with $13.9 billion estimated for the Property-Liability companies. Holding company level assets were $2.8 billion. Net income return on common shareholders equity was 9.0% and 12.0% on an operating income basis. Operating income ROE declined due to higher capital levels at September 30, 2013, and lower operating income for the trailing 12-month period, primarily reflecting higher catastrophes caused by Super Storm Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net income ROE declined primarily due to lower operating income and the loss in disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life.","Overall, a strong quarter in which we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and 2013 priorities. Now, Matt, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital Markets.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","It seems like -- first of all, let me wish Bob Block a speedy recovery, so we can beat him up and have fun with him again soon. On the agent count, are we in a position that you could be able to grow that over the next 3 to 5 years? Tom, what's your outlook there?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, first, thanks for the comments about our own Bob. He's listening, so I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that you want to beat him up. The -- let me make a comment, and then I'll turn it over to Matt. First, when you look over a longer period of time, 3 to 4 years, we knew we were going into this slow growth segment with trying to fix homeowners. We knew they would impact auto, and we also knew that we needed to help our most successful agencies become more successful. And those that could not get there needed to find another way to earn a living and not take care of our customers. So we made a whole bunch of changes. Some -- and then, of course, we always have turnovers. So we went down from like over 11,000 to like 9,000, as you point out, of agency owners. And that helped build up the size of the average agency from about 1,800 policies to over 2,500, which gives them more skills and capabilities, which is -- gets to the other point that I'd like to make, is, it's really about the number of feet on the street we have. So it's the number of agents that -- agencies we have, as well as the number of people, licensed sales professionals, they have in their offices. And that number has continued to go up, in part, because we've built a system which is very supportive of them. Everything from new technology, rolled out to the compensation programs, to the way in which we help them grow their businesses. So Matt can talk about the specific plans he has to grow. But I think you're correct in that, we are positioned now to begin to grow distribution in The Allstate Agency channel.","Matthew E. Winter","Bob, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. As Tom said, we look at total sales professionals, including exclusive agents, our licensed sales professionals, our exclusive financial specialists, The Allstate independent agents. So we're looking at the number of points of presence on the street capable of selling The Allstate products. But we're not just looking at it in terms of numbers. As Tom said, we're looking at it in terms of numbers, productivity of those existing points of presence and the geographic distribution to ensure that we have appropriate market penetration. One of the consequences of shutting down The Allstate direct operation and shifting all of The Allstate assets, The Allstate brand assets to an agency model, is that various geographies in the past were covered by the direct operation and did not have sufficient Allstate agencies on the street. That's part of the Heartland, that's part of -- pieces of New England. And so we have fairly aggressive initiatives underway, to put points of presence where they need to be, so we can appropriately serve customers throughout the United States. So you should expect to see not only numbers improve and productivity improved, but the geographic distribution change over time as we analyze it from a market potential and a market penetration perspective as well.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Thoughtful answers. Just a follow-up. You had year-over-year growth in PIF and Allstate brand auto, and certainly, insurance is showing good growth. So both of those units seem to be bucking the trend of the aggregators, which some of your competitors are starting to complain about. Did you see that at all as an issue in Encompass? Or are you a little just less immune to the aggregators' impact because of your current product mix?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, this is Tom. I would say, if you're talking about aggregators like Answer Financial, it continues to grow. It, of course, has a relationship with Esurance, where it takes a lot of the quotes that Esurance does not close, and then gets those customers placed with somebody else so that we can still serve them. And as you saw, their premiums were up this quarter as well. As it relates to each individual market, we are seeing the competition change in each segment. So many people in the lower left with The Allstate agencies are starting to pursue similar strategies to us in terms of product differentiation and bundling. In the Esurance side, you're not seeing people pursue the bundling. And we're just getting started there, and starting to -- we just rolled out, in one state, Homeowners. But Esurance has not only the potential of a good low-cost model and an ever-increasing strength in its brand to be able to then broaden the product suite from there. And Encompass has a specific focus. So rather than just try to sell standalone auto policies, it's really trying to sell both an auto and a home policy together, which is our packaged policy. So we think that getting the right customer value propositions for each segment is the way to compete.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just following up on some of the auto questions. Your new issued applications are up roughly 15% in The Allstate brand. Could you talk about it? And that's a big jump from what it was a couple of quarters ago. What's driven that big jump in applications? That's number one. But also number two, within those applications, are those more within your core preferred? Or is that moving more into the standard market for auto?","Thomas J. Wilson","Adam, I'll get Matt to talk about new business. But let me just point out that the biggest driver of growth in this quarter, actually, or this year in auto, is retention. So new business is obviously important to us, but the retention of -- is moved up about 0.7 points. So I'll ask Matt to talk first about new business, but then he'll probably want to talk some about the broad-base improvements we have in retention as well, because that's -- I guess that's another factor driving your question or your comment.","Matthew E. Winter","Adam, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. As Tom said, auto growth this quarter and auto growth generally, is driven in large part by increased new business and better retention. On the new business side, what we've seen is roughly 3 quarters of the lift came from improvements in our closed rate, and the remaining quarter is driven by quoting more customers. So if you look at the closed-rate component, I'd say the vast majority of that has to do with continued enhancement of our pricing methodology, our agency reengagement, and the increased home availability. All of those combined to improve our close rates. On the quote volume piece, it's certainly what we just talked about with Bob, it's increased points of presence and its reengagement of the agency force that's driving more quotes through the sales funnel. When you get to the renewal side, we saw widespread improvement in renewal rates. But the majority of the improvement on that side, on the retention side, in September -- through September, is a result of New York and Florida improvements. Now certainly, it's not only those 2, but those were the 2 biggest levers on the retention side. A number of other factors like increased homeowner availability, customer experience initiatives, we have a much better rate management in place, so there's less rate disruption. And all of that has contributed to the retention improvement as well.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So -- I'm not asking for prediction but as, particularly as your homeowner product becomes more competitive going forward, does that have the potential to continue to pick up your standard auto retention going farther?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, certainly without predicting, as I've said on a previous call, about 80% of our new house and home sales are coming with at least 1 auto. So it's a system, as we've said before. We talked about home availability impacting both the new business side and the retention side, since we're able to keep a stronger relationship with the customer. But it's also customer experience, rate management. It's the level of advice and service provided by The Allstate agency. And of course, it's just the sheer numbers of feet on the street capable of representing the Allstate brand and serving our customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, just wanted to circle back on the positive PIF growth year-over-year in The Allstate brand. It's the first time, I believe, in about 5 years. So the question I've been getting is the sustainability of that trend of positive growth going forward.","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, it's Tom. I think if you look back over the last, say, 8 quarters and do a trend analysis, you'll see that the negative impact on homeowners peaked about 1 year ago at about 6.5% down by quarter in terms of the number of policies we've done. And as we said this quarter, it's come down to 3.5%. And if you look at the trend analysis on price changes in homeowners, you'll see that, that's also come down. So that trend line should continue which, as Matt pointed out, is helpful to not disrupting our current customers. And then, in addition, as they rollout House & Home, that should drive the auto line up. So the auto line that you're pointing to has a similar trend line. And you can do the same kind of math. If you just look at it, it's continued to go. I think we should be able to -- and our goal is to pick up share in all of our brands, and we're clearly picking up share in Esurance and Encompass. The Allstate channel's not yet to the point where it's picking up share in its segment, but I believe that the broad-based system and approach that Matt's taking will do that.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on lost cost trends within the Allstate brand standard auto, it is the second quarter of losses exceeding earned premium growth, and both frequency and severity were higher in 2Q. I'm just trying to get a sense of the -- what's driving that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Matt can talk about profitability management specifically and what he's doing there. A couple of general comments I would make is that, first, frequency bounces around a lot as do paid severities in BI, in particular. So depending on which cases you're settling. And we feel good about the reserves we have up, which are a little different than paid. So we feel good that we've accurately recorded the profitability, and frequency is just within its normal range. But Matt can talk about what he does to adapt to that going forward. I would say we have, though, a organizational system, which over the last 10 years, if you look at our profitability in auto, we know how to adjust and adapt, if you look back at our performance. Matt, you can talk -- will talk about what he does with the specific trends you're talking about. And he may have some comments about specific places he's working on.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. So as Tom said, we've looked at it fairly carefully. We're confident it's not a quality of business or a systemic issue. It's normal volatility. It's within our 3-year historical ranges and it's within our expectations. We manage to the overall combined ratio targets, knowing that the individual components will move over time. So one of my favorite sayings and one of the ways we manage this business is, \"You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.\" And that's kind of how we think about it. The waves are the normal volatility in the business, it's movement of BI, it's PIF fraud, it's economic changes, it's competitor actions, it's weather changes. And we are set up not trying to fight those waves or not trying to prevent them from occurring, but to ride them. And so we use pricing, we use sophisticated pricing methodologies, we use rate actions, we use underwriting actions, we use process changes, and most importantly, we use our 14 market operating committees, and 15, including Canada, to give us early warning and detection of the movement of those waves so that we're able to react appropriately to them, quickly get out in front of them and be able to ride them. And my opinion having watched this team over the last several years is, we have a bunch of tremendous surfers out there who are very good at reading the waves and getting on top of them. And I think the team, overall, does a remarkably good job of managing that. So these ins and outs in volatility frequency and severity, while we always explore them and research them to make sure they're not systemic, they do not concern us.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then a separate one for Don. In terms of getting the freed-up capital from the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life out to the holding company for share buybacks, how quickly could that occur?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, this is Tom. That's really a question for Steve, I think.","Steven E. Shebik","Okay. So first, we have to close the deal, which is we believe early first quarter of next year. We have dividend limitations, which we'll have to get state regulatory approval to actually move the cash up to The Allstate Insurance company, and again, from the Allstate Insurance company up to All Corp. There are other alternative ways we might be able to move the capital through a repurchase of some of the equity ownership of Allstate Life from -- Allstate Life by Allstate Insurance company, which could get us up another level. But we still have to pay dividend up to All Corp. So it all requires regulatory approval, is the bottom line. We're in a strong capital position, so we're hopeful that our -- we apply for that, that we'll get favorable results.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, Tom. In regards to the goal of reducing Allstate Protection's expense ratio over time, I was curious if the major initiatives to drive that decline are already in motion, because I know there's been a lot of expense initiatives. And related, is part of the reason for the initiative due to the desire to bring Allstate's cost down closer to competitors who are gaining market share?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, a couple of things. First, I would say we're always trying to reduce expenses around here. So the challenge we've had in reduced -- and we've done that over the last 4 or 5 years. The challenge we had in terms of the expense ratio was that the top line was going down, so you had to reduce your expenses faster than your top line was going down, particularly when it related to the number of policies you have. So we weren't offsetting inflation in some of our other costs. So that was our first challenge. Second, what are we doing now? We're continuing that. We have a different approach to it, so we're really looking at more continuous improvement actions to continue to take costs out. Our cost though, it depends how you slice and dice it. We look at it by segment. And so when you look at the lower left, that's a different cost structure than the lower right. And when you -- so if you look at it, you have to really look at the cost relative to State Farm, Nationwide, Farmers, because those are the people providing the same kind of value proposition. So you can't say that the agency expense is too high, because the agency does a lot of work. And our customers love our agencies, and they're happy to pay for our agencies. Those customers in the lower right want to do it themselves. And so you have to make sure your expenses are -- right there are relative to GEICO and Progressive Direct. So we look at the expenses relative to the customer value proposition that we deliver to people. When you look -- so -- and we think we can do a better job in all of our segments, so there's lots of -- we already should be able to take cost out with the improvements in technology, data management and global sourcing. So that's part of why we're saying it's part of our effort, which is, we're supposed to deliver good value for our customers. When you look at it by component, and if you look at advertising expenses, we think we're very efficient and effective, whether that's our float rates that you heard are up or it's the close rates at Esurance. So we feel good about the advertising component. So when you look at technology, which is another large component of our expenses, we -- actually, I think we're in the top quartile in terms of best, in terms of cost per line of code delivered, because of the way we do it. That said, we think there are ways we can simplify our processes. We still have too many processes that are legacy-based and too much, what I just like to call, built-up wax. So you should expect our expense ratio to come down over time. I would like you to think about it relative to the customer value proposition that we're delivering, not just who's growing and who is not growing.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful and thorough. Last question is in regards to investment income levels. You guys gave great disclosures, thank you, but there's still a lot of moving parts. I was hoping to get some guidance. So on the 10-Q, it looks to be about $56 billion of assets maturing through 2014 between P&NC and Life. And if we -- probably at least a 100 basis point lower yield -- higher yield than current new money rates, I'd guess. And there's also a lot of life insurance spread-based liabilities moving off the balance sheet. So I guess, at the end of the day, I'm just trying to -- if you net out everything together, what's the dollar amount of investments we should be sizing up as needing to be reinvested at potentially lower new money rates 2014?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll get -- Judy will answer the question on that. First, I agree. It's difficult to project investment income with what's both going out in the markets, what we're doing with Lincoln benefit, and what we're doing from a risk and return standpoint. So that is why we try to have as much transparency as we can. The number sounds high to me in terms of what's rolling, and Judy will talk about that. But let me maybe just say, our philosophy on this is we're going to make the appropriate risk return tradeoff for our shareholders, not do something just to maintain operating income so that we make somebody's estimates for operating earnings, if it's a bad idea for our shareholders. A good example of that is the shortening that Steve showed you on the Property-Liability portfolio. We could have had higher and would have had higher operating income this year, had we not shortened that portfolio. We're not trying to trade interest rates, we just didn't think it was a good risk return tradeoff to be longer than 7 years. So we sold about as much of that as we could. So as you're thinking about our investment performance, you should obviously look at how much we deliver in operating earnings per share, because that's what you and we are all held accountable for. But also think about it in terms of our total return and say, do you think we're getting the right total return relative to the risk that we've taken? Judy, can you take on this $56 billion number?","Judith Pepple Greffin","Sure. So not sure where you're getting the $56 billion number. But if you look at our notes, we do outline the maturity profile of the overall portfolio on Page 10 of the notes. And in 1 year, it's about $2.5 billion. And in longer than 1, less than 5, it's closer to $22 billion. And plus Steve also outlined for the property and casualty company in the presentation, that also shows what's coming off in the property and casualty portfolio, which is significantly less than the $56 billion. When you think about what's going on in Allstate Financial, as Steve said, and what we've said in previous quarters, that's largely a cash-matched book. And LBL really doesn't change that, the sale of LBL. So as Steve said, we're going to lose about $12 billion in assets under management when LBL goes away, but that doesn't really change our maturity profile as much as -- I would think of it more as a cash-matched portion of the book is going away and the balance of the portfolio stays largely in line with where it should be. When you said 100 basis points, that's about right. Our portfolio yield at this point is a little over 3%, and our reinvest proxy as investment is intermediate corporate. So that's about between 1.75% and 2%, so it is about 100 basis points differential. But it's not anywhere close to the $56 billion that you're mentioning. Those hits [ph] have run off.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I wanted to see -- maybe ask about Esurance and whether or not some of the changes you've made and some of the things that you've experienced the last couple of quarters have changed your thinking about scale in that business, and whether or not your view of sort of how big you need to get there has changed in order to be sort of scaled profitable?","Thomas J. Wilson","Paul, this is Tom. Let me make sure I understand the question. Our view of scale, we think Esurance is of scale today, but we're more than willing to invest a fair amount of money in advertising, which we break out in the disclosures, which is more than it would support if you didn't want to grow it. But we -- actually, I think there's a great opportunity to grow the business because we have a unique value proposition, which we're continuing to build out. So maybe help me think through a little more on the scale piece.","Paul Newsome","Well, I guess advertising is part of that scale, right? That the all-in -- eventually, the all-in costs have to get to the point where we're profitable. Are we -- is your thinking there changed when we're going to get to the point where it's all-in profitable?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. I have a better sense of where you're trying to go with it. First, we think -- we look at it, and the way Don runs the business, and you can talk about it in a second here with Gary Tolman, is that we have to have profitable lifetime value by customer cohorts, so what we write in a particular year. Given that you have large upfront advertising expenses, obviously, the first year, you lose money. And then you make money after it, because your advertising expenses are not required, really, for retention. So you have a large loss. As it relates to the total P&L, what I've said to Don is, as long as you're writing lifetime value business, which gives us a good return on capital, I'm prepared to keep funding the growth because it's a good economic deal for our shareholders, even if the advertising costs are such that they more than offset the earnings you get from retention business. So I'm willing to write an overall loss at Esurance as long as we're growing economic value for the shareholders. We obviously could stop that any time we wanted, and it would -- the combined ratio would drop down into a profitable standpoint. Don, you might want to just talk about how you're managing and thinking about lifetime value.","Donald J. Bailey","Yes. Paul, first of all, I do agree with Tom. I don't think it's a matter of balancing scale and profitability, it's more growth and profitability. And so with PIF up over 30% more than prior year, that gets called into question. So when you look at the combined ratio that they're running, underlying is about 111.5. Because of the accounting model, there are 3 things going on. First is the advertising gets expensed upfront, as Tom said. We run it, as Tom said, based on the lifetime value of the business we're writing. So we're running it for economics. We take into account the acquisition costs, that's running in line with what we expect. Retention is running in line with what we expect, if not a little better. So we feel good about that. The second issue is the loss ratio. And I'll be honest, the loss ratio, it continues to be a little bit higher than we'd like. Gary and the team are on it. It's a few states. We're taking the right actions on pricing. If you look at the supplement, you'll see we've been consistently taking pricing actions, where necessary, throughout the year. But -- so I feel comfortable we'll get that back in line. But that's the second reason the compounded ratio is high. I think the third one is just investment in expenses. I mean, we're building out states. We're building out product lines. As Tom said, we sold our first homeowners policy last week in a bundled fashion. We've got motorcycle, we've got renters, and that requires a lot of upfront work to get those filings done and get the product ready to go, including technology investments. So I feel good about that. I feel good about the advertising response. A little bit of work to do still on the loss ratio. But overall, all those things put together, so long as we're making money on an economic basis, we're going to continue to grow the business.","Thomas J. Wilson","So Paul, let me -- it's Tom. Let me, maybe, make one other comment. If you look at the increase in premiums in average rate that we show in the supplement, you can see that in The Allstate brand, auto -- if you just add up the last 4 quarters, you can't really add them up, but it's easier math, but it's a little less than 2%. If you look at Esurance, it's a little less than 6%. And if you look at Encompass, it's a little less than 6%, too. So both of those latter 2 businesses, we believe, we still have work to do to improve profitability in the auto business. Not so much work that we want to shut growth off completely, but you may see growth in those 2 lines come down next year as we work harder to deal with the issue that Don talked about in terms of loss ratio. At the same time, you should see the trend, that Jay talked about, in The Allstate brand go the other way. And of course, remember that the Allstate brand, in terms of total items in force, is about 15x the size of those 2 individually and of course, 7x to 8x the combination of them. So we don't need as much growth. So if we give up x points of growth in Esurance and Encompass because we're trying to manage the loss ratio, we don't need nearly that percentage increase in the Allstate channel to get overall growth. And we're trying to grow not only in each channel, but we're trying to grow the overall company.","Paul Newsome","That was perfect. Second question. And I actually know the answer, but I'm going to ask you anyway. The new accounting, I've been asking everybody what they -- if they want to comment on the new GAAP accounting that's coming down the pipe.","Thomas J. Wilson","Are you talking about insurance, contracts and IFRS?","Paul Newsome","Yes, sir. The new FASB proposal.","Thomas J. Wilson","Sam has been actively involved in shaping that. I think I would comment that it's not the answer you just gave us, which is perfect. I'm going to write that down, Paul, that we gave you a perfect answer. But we don't think it's a perfect answer. Sam might have a view as to -- we've been very public about our statements on it.","Samuel H. Pilch","Paul, Sam Pilch. The -- yes, we filed a comment letter with the FASB and the IASB last week. And our view that the proposed accounting standards are radically different than the current. In fact, there is very little carryforward, if any, from the current standards that are proposed. The framework of the standards is to contribute to solvency measurement and performance and have deviated from historical performance reporting for financial purposes. So we have strong views that are different than proposed, and we advocate improvements to the current model, but not of any great significance, very targeted. Did I respond to your question?","Paul Newsome","That's also perfect.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Good quarter; new auto apps were up 20-ish, almost 20%, even though you raised pricing in standard auto by something like 3% last quarter. Let me say that's great, you're not seeing much of a trade-off there. But against this, folks like Progressive seem to be sort of selectively reducing pricing, and Travelers are talking about a big double-digit reduction to auto new business. And so I guess that tees up 2 important questions. The first is, how does more competitive pricing in the independent agency channel actually affect you in your exclusive channel? And second, I think driving a lot of this is people and companies talking a lot about price elasticity. And I'm wondering what you think your elasticity looks like in the exclusive channel, and how you think that compares to the independent?","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, I would go this way. First, we don't think it's all about price. If you're in the -- if you go back to our quadrant, if you're in the upper end of the -- upper side to those, it's clearly more price-sensitive, because those customers are sort of like, \"Just give me a name I recognize.\" So they tend to be a little more price-sensitive. We've tried to design our value propositions to recognize price is important, but that value is equally important. We don't get as much leakage between independent agencies, pricing and the captive channel. When you look at where our business comes from or where it goes, there's not -- obviously, people who want local advice go to the same kind of person, but we don't see a huge amount of pressure. If somebody in the independent agency channel takes that price down, we don't see a big change there. The -- as it relates to overall pricing, I would say we're sort of in line this year with our -- if you look at the top 3 competitors, top 7 states, we look in line with those people; not a big difference. Progressive might be at the low end. GEICO and State Farm would be slightly higher. But in the range of -- hard for a customer to tell. If you're talking about 0.5 points, $1,000 a year, $900 a year, you're talking about $5, so it doesn't really matter from a price elasticity standpoint. As it relates to what other people do in the future, I think Matt described how we run our business. We do the same thing in Esurance and Encompass, which is highly specific, we watch our cost, look at our value proposition, make sure it's fair to our customers. So I wouldn't -- and as it relates to Travelers taking big decrease, I think theirs was also related to a different product, and Don Bailey is shaking, may have some comment. But I think you're starting to see more people move to product differentiations. So if you look over a longer period of time, competition first was on sophisticated pricing, then it moved to advertising, particularly in the branded channels. And now it's moving to product differentiation.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful, that's helpful. And if I can just ask just one more quick question. Severity last year, everybody was generally concerned about it. It led to a bunch of price increases. Your guys' metrics, I mean, are still going up, of course, but seem to be moderating a bit. And there was some commentary coming from other companies that sort of suggested maybe the severity spike that everybody feared hasn't materialized. And I'm wondering if you guys have any color around that, or whether maybe people are just reacting to noise?","Thomas J. Wilson","I think I would go back to Matt's comment that to the extent we have cost pressures, and we think they're real, we increase our prices. If we think it's just noise, we don't. If you look at our overall pricing, it's been less than 2% over the last 12 months. So we're feeling okay about where we're at.","Operator","Our final question today is from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on -- want to square the deployable capital. So it looks like about $2 billion of run rate LBL, $1 billion at some point in the future. I remember you talked about the preferred issue that you, sort of balance sheet rightsizing you did late last year, creating another certain amount of capital plus the hold co. of cash of about $1 billion. Just want to think about -- first off, how much on the preferred capital movement, capital generation is yet to come? And how should we think about the right amount of liquidity you need to hold on to, like, on a go-forward basis, once you clear all these stacks? And then just one follow-up.","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll let Steve answer the preferred question.","Steven E. Shebik","So on the preferred side, we've issued somewhere over $600 million so far. We're planning to issue about $1.5 billion. So kind of as the market allows over the next several months. The proceeds of that will generally be used for general corporate purposes. But we do have $950 million of debt maturing next spring and summer, and we may need the cash to pay that down.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the timeline for the remainder of the liquidity? Like, how much cash should we think about you kind of hanging on to it, the holding company, on, I mean, a run rate?","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. This is Tom. So Mike, what we do is every year, we wait until we get the statutory. We try to look at our capital plan in sort of January, February, and then let shareholders know what we're going to do for the next 12 months. So we still have about $600 million left on our current share repurchase program, so we're out buying that back. And then in February, when we get done with sort of how the year turned out, where was the, where was statutory capital, and then we look forward, and say how do we feel about earnings, profitability of the business. And therefore, we then come up with a share repurchase dividend plan out of that, which is based on how much cash we think we need. Obviously, we don't think we need $2.8 billion at the holding company. So let me actually close kind of around that, which is to say if you just look at the quarter, a bunch of things that come together at the same time, and they all happen to show up in the P&L, which really reflects our broad-based approach to try and drive shareholder value. So we are -- we've been maintaining profitability in the auto business. We've dramatically improved profitability in the homeowners business. Obviously, this quarter with cash incredibly low, it really showed up. But we think it shifts it to a more sustainable position, which gives us that strength, Mike, as you're talking about, in terms of earnings power, in terms of giving us confidence to do it. At the same time, we've made some strategic moves to -- which give us increased capital called Lincoln -- the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. At the same time, we're working to improve the strength of the balance sheet by issuing things like Preferred, really, at little cost to the shareholders in terms of current earnings. And at the same time, we're buying back a bunch of stock and paying what is a great cash on cash return to shareholders, which cash on cash is both dividends and then the shares we buy back. So it's a very strong side we're in [ph]. And we're going to be in a better position, I believe, at the end of this year on that. And we still have plenty of capacity to fund the growth that you're start -- are now starting to see. So we feel good about the way everything came together. You wouldn't expect it all to hit the P&L all in one quarter, but it did. And we feel like we've been successful in driving shareholder value, which relates into increasing the value of your shares. Thank you very much for investing your time to continue and learn more about our performance. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time today to be part of our Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We'll begin with some brief commentary on our results from Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and me, followed by a question-and-answer period. On the call with us today are Don Bailey, Head of Emerging Businesses and Encompass; Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies.","Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement, as well as posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are available on our website. We plan to file our 10-K for 2012 by the end of February.","Beginning with the first slide, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate\u2019s operations. Actual results may differ materially from those statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks.","Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. Recording of this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have once this call is completed.","Now, let's begin with Tom.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning, and thanks again for your interest in Allstate. Today, I'll cover our results in relationship to our strategy in 2012 priorities, then I'll cover our priorities for 2013. Bob will cover our business unit results and Steve will cover investment performance and capital management.","But before we go through 2012, let me just update everybody on Sandy and the progress we've made in helping our customers restore their lives. So as you know, Sandy was a huge storm, affected an enormous heavily populated area and of course, many of you, personally. We're one of the first insurance companies on the scene to help our customers. With our mobile units, we often got to customers' homes before they even called us. Now we received about 170,000 claims to date and we've closed 98% of the claims reported. We paid about 95% of our expected net losses. Now we did update our initial loss estimate, which was, as you'll remember, $1,075,000,000 to $1,117,000,000. That's $42 million increase. And our losses, of course, would have been significantly higher had we not taken the actions we did due to catastrophic exposures over the prior 6 years.","And of course, while the numbers are large, the real significance is the fabulous work that the Allstaters had done for our customers, whether that's our claim professionals, our local agency owners or the thousands of other key members across the country that sort of rose to the occasion, helping those people rebuild their lives. We're very proud of what we've gotten accomplished, and we know our customers are happy as well.","Our customer-focused strategy is to provide unique products and services to distinct customer segments, which is based on their preferences for price, service and delivery channel. That's shown on Slide 2. You can -- there's the 4 segments we have there.","The Allstate brand serves customers who prefer local advice and assistance and branded products. That's in the lower left side of that slide. In 2012, we introduced our expanded -- or expanded new products and services like Claim Sat Guarantee, Drive Wise, Good Hands Roadside and House & Home to differentiate Allstate from the competition.","The Allstate brand profitably grew the top line in 2012, primarily on the strength of increased average premium for auto and homeowners. It generated a total underlying combined ratio in the mid-80s. Now policies in force did decline for the full year. But in the fourth quarter, we began to reduce the negative impact of auto profitability improvement actions in New York and Florida and our long-term program to raise returns in the homeowners business.","Allstate brand premium growth did accelerate at the end of the year in auto, homeowners, Emerging Businesses and Canada.","Esurance, which serves the self-directed customer segment in the lower right, continued to exceed expectations from the top line perspective, producing net written premiums over $1 billion for the year and unit growth of 31% year-over-year. The combined ratio remains elevated given the rapid growth, but we continue to monitor the long-term profit estimates and adjust pricing as needed, and we're comfortable with the economics of that business.","The advice-seeking brand new to our customer segment is in the upper left. That's served by Encompass, which of course distributes to independent agencies. Our strategy is to serve this market with a differentiated package policy. That gained traction throughout 2012, with top line growth of 5.3% compared to 2011 and 8.2% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2011.","The underlying combined ratio was 96 for the year. But given the property risk in that business, we need to further improve profitability in that segment.","Answer Financial is in the upper right. That serves self-directed brand neutral customers. That's broker and policies, some leads received from Esurance and third parties. This business generated nonproprietary premiums, which don't show up in our top line of over $400 million for the year. This represents an increase of 9% from 2001.","So these results show that our strategy of providing differentiated products and services to a unique customer segment is working.","We also had strong operating results in 2012 as shown on Slide 3. On a consolidated basis, we generated $2.3 billion in net income. That's an increase of $1.5 billion from 2011.","[Technical Difficulty]","Thomas J. Wilson","Excuse me, is somebody not on mute? Okay. Well, with that weather forecast let me keep going. So operating converted $2.1 billion. Our book value per share rose over 17% to $42.39 per share. That's at the year-end 2012. We produced a net income return on equity of 11.9% and an operating income ROE of 12.4%.","The underlying property-liability combined ratio was 87.2, which compares favorably to our outlook range of 88 to 91 at this time last year. That was a result of both excellent execution and favorable weather.","As we discussed throughout 2012, we have 4 priorities for that year: One, maintain our profitability; two, raise returns in homeowners and annuity businesses; three, we want to grow insurance premiums; and four, proactively manage our investments and capital. And we accomplished all of those goals last year.","We maintained auto profitability with an Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio of 96.1, which is a slight increase from 2011. That's primarily due to the effects of Sandy. The underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto was 94.0, which is compared to 95.3 in 2011.","Homeowners profitability was improved with an underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand homeowners of 65.1. That's a 5.8% -- or 5.8 point improvement from 2011. The recorded combined ratio for the year was 88.0, which included Sandy and the other catastrophes we experienced throughout 2012, but it was helped by prior year catastrophe reserve releases. This result shows that our efforts over last 4 years are working. We also benefited from milder-than-expected weather outside of catastrophes, which we do not expect to be the case in 2013.","Annuity returns also improved on strong limited partnership income results. That said, low interest rates will continue to put negative pressure on returns from this line.","In total, property-liability net written premiums grew 4% from 2011, as we just discussed. Additionally, issued life insurance policies through the Allstate agencies increased 9.3% for the year, while Allstate Benefits grew new business written premium by 6.5% over the prior year.","Our investment portfolio generated a total return of 7.3%, reflecting proactive portfolio actions and the decline in interest rate. Portfolios have been supported by strong limited partnership, results mostly offsetting the downward pressure caused by lower reinvestment rate.","From a capital management perspective, we repurchased $910 million worth of our shares in 2012. That's completing the $1 billion buyback we started last year in 2011, and then we initiated another $1 billion buyback in December to be funded by issuing a light to modest subordinated debentures. When you add in dividends, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders.","Reflecting the confidence and the execution of our strategy and operating plans, we raised the quarterly dividend by 13.6% to $0.25 per share for the first quarter of this year, and we authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.","Looking forward for 2013, our priorities are very similar to last year's but with an increased emphasis on growth. If you go to Slide 4. They're to grow our insurance premiums, maintain our auto profitability, raised returns and homeowners and annuity businesses and proactively manage our investments. We're adding a fifth priority, which is to reduce our cost structure.","Now effective expense management has always be a part of our disciplined approach to business. We always work hard on keeping our expenses down. But given the difficult economic climate our customers are facing, we're adding this priority to heighten our focus on what customers are really willing to pay for.","Finally, in keeping with our practice to provide you with an outlook for our property-liability underwriting -- underlying combined ratio in 2013, we set a range of 88 to 90, which is 1 point narrower than last year's. This outlook reflects the more stable base of auto profitability and the actions taken to combine to erase homeowner rates, partially offsetting is an expectation for a higher non-catastrophe frequency with more normal weather.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to cover the details of the business unit results.","Robert Block","Thanks, Tom. Let's review the results for property-liability in Allstate Financial. On Slide 5, which provides the details for property-liability net written premium and policies in force. For Allstate brand standard auto, at $15.7 billion. The net written premium was essentially flat for the year. We did post positive premium growth over prior year for the fourth quarter of 2012. Increased average premium and a slightly higher renewal ratio more than offset a small decline in new issued applications.","Units declined 0.9% from -- in 2012 from 2011 but sequentially were flat to the end of the third quarter 2012. We received approval for rate increases averaging 3.1% on a countrywide basis over the course of 2012, in keeping with our priority of maintaining auto profitability.","Allstate brand homeowners increased net written premium in the fourth quarter and the year by 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. The quarter's result was driven by a 7.1% increase in average premium on a gross written basis and an increase in new issued applications, partially offset by a decline in retention. Approved rate changes averaged more over 6% in 2012 on a countrywide basis, as -- to improve the margins in homeowners.","Emerging businesses, Encompass, Canada and Esurance all contributed positive net written premium growth in 2012.","On Slide 6, we provide a breakdown of our combined ratio for the year and for the fourth quarter. And just a few points. For the year, we recorded a combined ratio of 95.5, an improvement of 7.9 points from 2011 as we maintained our margins in auto and significantly improved our margins in homeowners. The Allstate and Encompass brands saw material improvements in the recorded combined ratios in 2012, much of it coming from lower catastrophe losses.","The 2012 property-liability underlying combined ratio was 87.2, better than the range of 88, 91, which we provided at the beginning of 2012. In addition to maintaining discipline in pricing and claims management, we benefited from very favorable non-catastrophe weather during the year. Our 2013 underlying combined ratio outlook range is 88 to 90, and represents an improvement from the outlook we provided in 2012. It also factors in a return to more normal non-cat weather trends for the year.","Loss cost trends for the Allstate brand standard auto modestly improved in the fourth quarter of 2012.","On Slide 7, reported frequencies, bodily injury and property damage, which are shown in the upper left of the chart, declined 2.1% and 3.7% for the quarter -- from the fourth quarter 2011. For the year, frequencies for both coverages declined relative to 2011.","Paid severity, shown in the upper right, also moderated in the quarter with bodily injury increasing 5.2% and property damage increasing only 0.4%. For 2012, the paid severities for bodily injury and property damage increased 4.1% and 3.0%, respectively. When you add the results from the other coverages in auto with our rate actions over time, you get a fairly steady combined ratio result, as shown by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of Slide 7.","Maintaining auto profitability remains a critical priority for us and one in which we have a history of success, as depicted on Slide 8. In the top chart, we have posted an Allstate brand standard auto underlying combined ratio of 95 or better in every quarter but 2 for the 4 years shown in the chart. The chart at the bottom shows the improved results for average earned premium, which is the red line, and the very favorable loss trends in 2012, which is in -- the blue line, which we expect to moderate in 2013.","A similar set of charts are included for homeowners on Slides 9 and 10. Non-catastrophe loss costs remained below prior year levels in the fourth quarter, as reported frequency declined 10% while paid severity increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, shown in the upper right on Slide 9.","With the loss cost trends declining and average earned premium increasing over 9% in the fourth quarter, the underlying combined ratio continued to improve to 62.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The 4.6 point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2011. For the year, the underlying combined ratio was 65.1%, 5.8 points better than 2011.","Referring to the chart in the bottom of Slide 10, average earned premium has steadily increased due to the impact of our rate actions taken over the last several years. The loss trend has been very favorable for the entire year, a trend we expect to moderate in 2013.","Moving to Allstate Financial on Slide 11. We've continued to focus on growing underwritten products sold through Allstate agencies and Allstate Benefits further reducing the concentration of the spread base products. This shift will improve returns.","Total premiums and contract charges on underwritten products increased 3.8% for the year and 4.9% for the fourth quarter. In 2012, issued life insurance policies sold through Allstate agencies increased 9.3% for the year and 11.9% in the fourth quarter relative to comparable periods in 2011.","New net written premiums produced by Allstate Benefits rose 6.5% for the year compared to 2011 and 13.3% for the fourth quarter, when a significant portion of the business is written as part of the annual enrollments season.","Allstate Financial generated net income of $541 million, a decline from 2011's net income of $590 million, driven by after-tax net realized capital losses in 2012 compared to realized capital gains in 2011, partially offset by a reserve release in 2012 associated with the nonroutine valuation adjustment for derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuities and a 4.3% increase in operating income. The increase in operating income was due to an increase in the investment spread, driven primarily by the reclassification of equity method limited partnership income from realized capital gains to investment income beginning in 2012, partially offset by a decreased benefit spread and increased expenses.","For the quarter, net income was $166 million, a $31 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2011, with operating income of $144 million, a $14 million or 10.8% increase from the prior year quarter.","Operating income return on equity of 8% declined 30 basis points in 2012 from 2011, as higher operating income was more than offset by the growth of capital, due to the accumulation of undistributed profits.","Lastly, ongoing efforts to reduce exposure to spread-based business drove a decline in contract holder funds of just over $3 billion, bringing the balance in contract holder funds to $39.3 billion at the end -- at year-end 2012. We continue to review options to reduce the size and improve the returns of the spread-based businesses.","With that, let's hear from Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Bob. We delivered strong investment results in the fourth quarter and for the year, as we balance portfolio yield, risk and return objectives in the current low interest rate environment while proactively positioning the portfolio for an eventual rise in interest rates.","On Slide 12, you see our portfolio total return of 7.3% for the year, driven by significant fixed income and equity appreciation, coupled with state [ph] net investment income. The returns reflect positive contributions across the entire portfolio.","For the fourth quarter, net investment income was $1,033,000,000 and the annualized portfolio yield was 4.7%, reflecting an increase over both the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase includes the impact of our change in classification of equity method limited partnership results to net investment income from realized capital gains that Bob noted a bit earlier.","Excluding limited partnership results, that investment income was above the prior quarter, reflecting higher equity dividends but lower than the fourth quarter of 2011, consistent with the smaller Allstate Financial portfolio and impact of lower reinvestment yields.","Also on this slide is the size and composition of our overall portfolio. We ended 2012 with a carrying value of $97 billion, reflecting the improved valuations, which more than offset the ongoing reduction of Allstate Financials spread-based business. So in 2012, we continue to favor this ability of corporate credit, including an increased allocation of high yield bonds.","Slide 13, highlights trends in the portfolio, unrealized gain, yield, maturity profile. The chart on the upper left shows the trend in pretax unrealized net capital gains. We ended 2012 with an unrealized gains of $5.55 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.67 billion over year-end 2011. The increase is primarily in the fixed income portfolio and resulted from tighter credit spreads and lower interest rates.","In the fourth quarter, we further reduced interest rate risk in our property-liability portfolio shifting out of longer maturity assets. These and similar future actions will better position the portfolio for an eventual rise in interest rates. The sale of longer-term security pulls forward future income to the realization of gains. We expect this activity to contribute to a decline in our property-liability portfolio yield and net investment income.","The chart on the upper right illustrates a shift in our fixed income maturity profile, resulting from our proactive management of interest rate risk over the past several years. Our actions are repositioned to fixed income portfolio, include shifting out of longer-term municipal and corporate bonds and shorter-term, lower-yielding treasuries in immediate term bonds.","We expect our continued reinvestment in the current low rate environment, portfolio actions to reduce interest rate risk and the ongoing reduction of Allstate financials liabilities to further pressure investment income and portfolio yields going forward.","We finished the quarter in a strong capital position, as you can see on Slide 14. Shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion increased $2.3 billion at year end 2011. Statutory surplus rose at $17.2 billion. And deployable assets at the holding company level were $2.1 billion at year end.","Our book value per share came in at $42.39, 17.2% higher than the year-end 2011 on the strength of our operating performance, improved portfolio valuation and active capital management.","We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders during 2012 through dividends and share repurchases. Yesterday, the Board increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25, a $0.03 per quarter or 13.6% increase.","We completed the November 2011 our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter, began repurchases under renewed $1 billion program authorized by the Board in December to be financed through hybrid security issuances. The Board also authorized an additional $1 billion repurchase program yesterday, bringing our total buyback program to $2 billion to be executed through March 2014.","Now, let's go to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I want to point out that I believe it's the first time that Allstate brands premiums were in positive territory on growth for the first time in 11 quarters. So I want to get your perspective on whether you feel that trend could continue in light of pit [ph] growth still being negative.","Thomas J. Wilson","This is Tom. I'll give you a perspective and Matt might want to jump in as well. First, you're right. Premiums have gone up that is, as we pointed out, largely a result of higher average premiums in the homeowners business. The actions we've taken over that period of time and actually beginning before 11 quarters ago is really to reduce our catastrophe exposure by getting smaller homeowners. As you know we're down like 1.2 million homeowner policies in the last 4 years. That has obviously had an impact on our auto business as the actions we took in New York and Florida, which were proactive and fast that we went on that one hard, which hit both of our -- also hit auto growth. Matt has a number of plans going on to try to turn that around, and maybe he wants to make a few comments about the strategy to movement both -- I think it was really after his items and of course, our policy than opposed to premiums.","Matthew E. Winter","Jay, it's Matt. Look, the way we look at this is the last several years have been stabilization year as we -- couple of stabilization years as we wanted to ensure that we were charging an appropriate rate and getting the appropriate returns in the business. We are continuing to focus on top line and if -- and we'll continue to do that as long as we're able to do that in an economic manner. We look at a couple of indicators. We look at -- on the homeowners side, we look at new business and we look at retention. And as you see in Page 28 of the sup, new business was up 5.8 above prior year in the fourth quarter, and the trend was extremely positively started, first quarter at minus 11.4, second quarter was minus 5.7, third quarter flattened out and the fourth quarter we were at positive 5.8. You add to that, the retention side of it. And as we've slowed down the nonrenewal actions and as we've focused more intensively on the customer experience, we've seen the gap to prior year retention improving each quarter and it improved in the fourth quarter to just minus 0.6. So on the homeowners side, you take that boost to new business, retention getting better, nonrenewal actions declining, greater focus on customer experience, the impact of House & Home, which we rolled out to 17 states in 2012 and we have another 12 additional states planned for this year and in those dates, production is up extremely strong. And so we have a good story on the homeowners side. Not only does that help homeowners revenue and if, but it helps auto as well due to the bundling. And you look at the same 2 factors on the auto side and although new business continues to run below prior year, the gap got smaller in the second half of 2012 if you look at the first half versus prior year, versus second half, versus prior year, it's dramatically different. First quarter, I think we were down almost 11%; second quarter, down 3%; and then third and fourth, it was down 1.3%. So clearly moderating on the new business side and retention improved. So as you can see on Page 28 of the sup, the retention trend has been pretty stable at 89 the past 3 quarters. We got a boost from Florida and in the fourth quarter, where their retention improved and we've stabilized things in Florida and New York, as Tom said. And so we think we're pretty well positioned to change the momentum and change these trend lines. We've been moderating a lot in the last quarter and we're cautiously optimistic.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. I also wanted to touch base on the comment about expense management. The P&C expense ratio was 26.5% in 2012. It's up from around 25% in the 2010 time frame. Is that a good way to think about it in terms of where Allstate wants to get the expense ratio back to?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, a better way to look at it is by segment. So look at the expense ratio for Esurance, you'll see that's substantially higher than net average. And that's because of course, it's all front-end loaded with advertising expenses. Then you can look at the Allstate Agency piece, and then you can look at the Encompass piece. And our goal is to have a highly competitive expense position in each of those segments, which is relative to the way in which you go to market and the services you provide to your customers. So for example, in the Allstate Agency channel, our agencies provide ongoing service and counseling for our customers, which is why they get a renewal commission. You don't have that in the Esurance business model because those customers don't want that. So you have to really look at it by segment.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question regards to the 88 to 90 underlying combined ratio guidance. So that's, I believe this year, it was lower than 88. You guys are hoping to maintain auto or the goal is to maintain auto and try to continue the improvement in homeowners. So that would -- so I guess basically, is the delta there kind of the -- you guys don't expect the lower non-cat weather to occur? And if so, could you size up what benefit you guys have from that in the full year?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes. It's good -- good question, Mike. Let me address. So 88 to 90, last year, we had a 3-point spread, this year it's a 2-point spread, and that's largely based on our confidence that the actions that Matt's team has taken in New York and Florida are working, and we like what we see there, so we can have a narrower range. Secondly then you say, \"Okay, but your still -- range is still above where you are this year.\" I think you really have to -- it is the weather. It's a reflection of a return to more normal frequency in auto and homeowner business. December was an incredibly strong month for us. If you look at the underlying combined ratio in homeowners for the fourth quarter, it was like 62 in change. I don't think the business is operating at this point at that big a delta versus where it was last quarter -- the fourth quarter of last year. So just some of that is weather. Doing a variance analysis on weather, it's possible. But it's -- there is some art to it. And so our range is a range we expect to be in. That's why we established it. I think it gives you some confidence as to where we've gone. And we typically are in there, and so we made an estimate as what the weather would be and said we'll be in the 88 to 90.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And in regards to the investment portfolio, it sounds like Steve talked about preparing us for higher interest rates but then so shifting, reducing interest rate for sensitivity. So what kind of new money yields are you guys expecting in the near term versus the existing portfolio yields?","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me give you an overview from corporate risk standpoint, and then Judy will talk about what she's going to implement that. So overall when we look at the corporate risk profile, when we look at interest rates, cats, underwriting risk, inflation, a whole variety of things and from our risk management perspective, we're assuming that rates will rise. We don't think they're going to run away tomorrow, but we think they will go up over time. So as we usually do, we try to get out ahead of these things and be proactive about it. We're not -- we only have a sort of moderate level of concern about inflation, so -- which is another thing, of course, I can -- for insurance companies. So what we're doing is reducing our interest rate risk. We started that in the fourth quarter. We'll continue it throughout this year. And that means, basically, taking capital gains on the portfolio and pulling operating income forward. So you can take capital gain today or you can get the higher interest rates. We believe the economic smart thing to do is to hold those gains forward, and so we run the company economically not just for operating EPS. Judy can talk about what she's done to the portfolio and what she's reinvesting in.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So when you look at the portfolio, currently the -- just looking at the fixed income yield on the property and casualty portfolio, it's around 3 8, and that's a good estimate of what you should think about in terms of where the portfolio is in some of the activities that we're doing. The reinvest that we're looking at is, as Tom said, shorter duration. A good proxy would be 3- to 5-year maturities, investment-grade corporates, probably yields around 1.5% to 2% is a good way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Congratulations on the Esurance growth. It's not so surprising the first quarter, but almost every quarter it's been strong. And when I look at GEICO and Progressive, there's a heavy seasonality to when they add policies. Can you talk a little bit about the marketing there and whether you expect to a certain point will normalize to a seasonality or not?","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. I'll get Don to answer that, but let me first. In Esurance, we're really happy with Esurance. It fits with our customer-focused strategy. We didn't think -- while we had an offering in that lower right-hand quadrant with the Allstate brand, we're not really taking share and we need a sharper, better focused customer offering to service self-served customer. And we felt we could leverage a bunch of our capabilities at Allstate, which we've done other times, whether that be with Encompass or the Benefits business. And so net-net, we like what we've done. We like -- 30% growth is good. And Don can talk about the seasonality and perhaps talk about the other things you're doing to drive growth in the business, kind of surf around for the acquisitions.","Don Civgin","First of all, on the seasonality question. The seasonality Esurance has historically followed their marketing spend. And so there has been a higher first quarter customer acquisition in the past. But I think that will probably moderate in the future as they've increased their advertising spend a fair amount, and I think we're going to spread that out through the year going forward. As far as the marketing spread, the efficiency throughout the year, remember, this wasn't just -- when we completed the acquisition at the fourth quarter of last year, we began a new ad campaign heralding the fact that Esurance and Allstate were now connected. That campaign began at the beginning of 2012. And the impressions have been building as the year has gone on. So it was less effective the first day it ran than it was the last day it has run through the year, and I think the momentum that's built has been very strong. So the campaigns are working quite well. It's hard not to be happy with written premium growth going up 30% for the quarter on an apples-to-apples basis, if you adjust for the acquisition date last year. The policies are going up, 31% for the year, so that's strong as well. And I think, from my perspective, we acquired Esurance so that we could really compete effectively against GEICO and Progressive in that customer segment. And our goal was to grow that business economically. The GAAP combined ratio kind of gets in the way of looking at things economically for you, but we're convinced that the growth we're getting is economic when you spread the advertising expense over the life of that customer. And we want to see how far we can take it. But clearly, it's doing what we wanted, which is taking market share in an economic way.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so the ad spend, will -- you expect will be consistent throughout the year?","Don Civgin","No, I don't know that it will be completely consistent quarter-to-quarter. I just don't think we'll have as much seasonality as they've had historically in the past.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the other question, capital management, obviously, you have a $2 billion share repurchase on the table now. Presuming, amenable non-cat weather and reasonably low amount of catastrophes, could there be more buyback in 2013 if the weather complies?","Thomas J. Wilson","This is Tom. The -- we've always shown an ability and a willingness to deploy capital back to shareholders using dividends or share repurchases. $2 billion is a pretty big program when your market cap is $21 billion. We're pretty comfortable at that. I think working through that is probably what you should expect in 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So the first question is on the net investment income, if I could just have a clarification. So I believe the all money rates that you have right now is 3.8%, new money rates 1.5% to 2.0%. That's on the P&C portfolio. Just curious how much for fixed income assets are maturing this year and next year. And so yes, that would be helpful.","Judith Pepple Greffin","Okay. So the old money rate is really just the portfolio rate that you've referenced, so that's around 3.7% to 3.8%. And the way that we're estimating maturities prepays and calls for 2013 in the property and casualty portfolio is between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, with the piece of that being maturities which will actually happen, and then we just have to estimate the calls from prepays, so that's why that we have the range.","Thomas J. Wilson","And on top -- if you're trying to get an estimate for investment income, on top of that will be the roles we do intentionally on our part to reduce interest rate risk. Okay, so we're going to be selling securities and we have been throughout the last fourth quarter and we'll be selling in this year, taking capital gains, which will then be reinvested. That's on top of what you just talked about.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. So I just want to get the numbers right. So the $1.5 billion to $2 billion is fourth quarter?","Judith Pepple Greffin","No, that's for the total year for the property and casualty portfolio, but that excludes what Tom just talked about. And that activity, when we look at that activity, we think it's going to be in the range of 4 to -- we think that, that activity is going to be on top of the call to maturity.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much of a negative impact do you think that, that's going to have on the investment income?","Thomas J. Wilson","We're not -- here's what I'd say, we're not -- trying not to do earnings guidance by line. And so what you can do -- the way that you get an estimate is look at our capital gains each quarter before, then you can adjust as you look forward based on how much we've sold that quarter and what you think we'll reinvest. Because the timing of it, how much we do will depend on what we think about the future trends in interest rates where we're at the pace of it. So that a -- we're living through that one. We're letting you know our intention is to sell bonds, realize gains and accelerate it in some operating and commit to capital gains. But we don't really have a forecast for what we'll do this year.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second question is on Esurance. The growth was great. But the business is running at a 108, I believe, core combined ratio. Do you think that you can get it to 100 or maybe a 96 by this year or is it going to be next year?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll give you the directions I've given to Don, and Don can talk about the actual number. But we look at the loss ratio. And we say, where is the loss ratio relative to what it needs to be economic. We also look at that loss ratio by age of business and we look at that loss ratio by state. And so there are sort of several different cuts on it, with the goal of making sure that there's enough profit coming off, the difference between premiums and the loss ratio, to pay for all these upfront expenses. And so to the extent that it is, and Don can talk about cost of acquisitions, stuff like that. We'll continue to fund that business for growth. Esurance hit our underwriting combining $192 million this year in terms of negative to it, and I'm good with that because it was all economic. We can't continue to invest in growth in that business, which means the combined ratio will be over 100. But if you're making money on it, it's just -- on advice segment  by sale, by age, by state, then we don't worry as much about what the total combined ratio is at the top because of the way the advertising expenses are accounted for. Don, you...","Don Civgin","Yes. I just maybe add a couple of things. We can -- this is going to sound bad, we can actually make the combined ratio kind of what we'd like it to be by adjusting the advertising. So I think what you're talking about is the GAAP combined ratio and the better thing to focus on is what Tom talked about, which is the economic combined ratio. Their accounting model is different than Allstate\u2019s. Most of their expense is front loaded on advertising, back it's expenses for the quarter, you do -- you take the advertising expense. But then the second term and the third term and the fourth term, the profitability goes up substantially because you don't have the commission we have on the Allstate side. So what we look at is over the life of the policy we're writing, is that business economic? At the moment that business is quite economic for us, and so, as Tom said, we're happy to feed the growth of that by investing in the advertising upfront. It's going to depend on making sure that the retention remains strong. And I would tell you the retention has gone up this year. And so nobody likes to run 108. I don't like it either. But I think you have to go below that number and try to understand why it's running 108. If it's running 108 for good reasons, we'll continue doing that.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Encompass and what structurally is the reasons why the profitability differs from your in force Allstate brand business?","Thomas J. Wilson","It's Tom. I'll make a quick comment and maybe, Don, you can talk about the strategy and to grow the business profitably. So Encompass for us serves the customers who want local advice but want choice between carriers. So we sell through independent agents. The cost structure associated with selling through independent agents is higher than the cost structure of selling through captive agents, and it's pretty obvious as to why that would be the case. And so we run a higher expense ratio there. That's because that's what customers want. We made a couple of changes to improve that business. The biggest of which was in the management team, and Don can talk about what we're doing to leverage that management team skills and how we expect to grow the business. I would tell you, I'm not completely satisfied with the profitability as to where it needs to be because the combined ratio is still a little high and there's a lot of property in that package policy. And so you need a pretty low combined ratio on that property business. But Don can talk about -- we've made good progress and we're seeing some signs of life in that business. I'm happy about it.","Donald J. Bailey","Paul, this is Don, we've -- Don Bailey. We've made good progress over the last couple of years in that business, as Tom said, a new management team, but we've reestablished our focus on the package product. So for us, the strategy is it's about customers and it's about agents. So on the customer side, we're very committed to the package product, which is the 12-month policy, 1 premium, 1 bill, 1 property deductible, and we think that differentiates in the marketplace for our customers, which are in that mass affluent segment. From an agent standpoint, we recommitted over the last couple of years to them as well, in terms of ease of doing business, being consistent in our underwriting appetite, operating our technology platforms, and that has led to a significant increase in the number of engaged agents we have. We distribute to about 2,800 agents in the United States. There's about 37,000 total in the independent agent space, about 1,700 of those we would consider active. So we've gotten more runway with our current agents and we've got probably less than 1% market share in the segments that we chase. So we think some of the recent trends for us certainly can continue if we continue to run the business the way we have been.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I think [indiscernible] has thrown out a $1,500 per customer at GEICO benefit to Berkshire. I don't know whether you've thought through what a customer is worth to you in lifetime benefits. But if you use his $1,500 as -- one of your customers is worth on your 240,000 policies that you added, you probably added $350 million of value to the firm, which will be 1\/3 of your purchase price. Do you think about a value of a customer in lifetime benefits to the company?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, I don't know where Warren Buffet gets $1,500. So I can't really speak to sort of the math. I'll just assume that he's got -- whatever his numbers are. I tend to think about customers not in economic term, is that how much can we make off them, but as to how do we fully meet their needs and capabilities and how do we differentiate ourselves so we keep winning them. Just because you got them once doesn't mean you're going to keep them. And when you start putting numbers on them and say that this person puts a $1,500 sign seems odd to me. So that's just the way we think about it. But we think about it as -- like we're trying to always do a good job. We got to drive retention up. So you see retention going up in the Esurance business because of the work we're doing, the way we serve our customers, the type of customers. Matt talked about retention in his businesses. And so I'd like to keep them all forever, and that's our goal. And I don't know if that makes him worth $1,500 more, but I know it's good for our shareholders.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Somehow you have the size, your ad spend versus the customers that you get. So you have to put a number on it at some point, but I hear it's just softer -- it may be a softer process in your current mindset. If I could pivot to the life company, I'm a -- I'd be interested on where this company stands relative to Matt's and yours goal that you articulated to get $1 billion of dividends out of it over the next 4 years, I think, which was a couple of years ago. It looks like the stat surplus is down. But you said that the ROE had some pressures because of more capital. I guess the final question is where does the life company stand in your sort of overall strategy? It looks like there are some people out there willing to pay pretty good prices for life companies today, which I'm sure you're mindful of. What's the overall game plan with the unit?","Thomas J. Wilson","A lot -- as usual, you've thought it through in a very thorough way. So I'll try to give you -- I mean, I'll start to end it and see if I could give the details as well. First, our strategy at Allstate Financial has been to focus on underwritten products. If you go back 10 years, it was to make it bigger and broader, and we're pushing hard at both the annuity business and the life business, expanding through both our captive channels and independent agencies. Given -- in about the middle -- about 2005 or so, we said, \"This annuity business doesn't look like it's given us the kind of returns we like.\" We've got fixed annuities. The returns were low. Variable annuities, we thought the returns were too speculative, and we start to shift. So we sold the VA business, of course, in 2006. We started shutting the -- slowing down the size of our annuity sales. Have we been pressured enough, I would have stopped them all. It may be sold at that time. That would have been a good idea. Because the deals we see now people are selling annuity, I'm not sure they're great transactions. But so where we are today is, of course, focus on our underwritten product, be supportive of the Allstate Agency customer rate, that lower left, they want to buy everything from 1 person, if they can. Also we have a great position in the workplace of Benefits business. And as we mentioned, that business is growing quite well. We really like that business. It gives good returns. So both a -- in underwritten price, returns are above our cost of capital, and so we're focusing on growing those businesses. At the same time, to get the cost of the return on equity up, we've also been trying to reduce the size of the fixed annuity business, since that's a long way we have left. We've been pretty aggressive. I think we're down about $3 billion this year done. We'd like it to go down faster. We're looking at every -- which way we can to make it go down faster because it's just low ROE business. What we've learned along the way is we can separate the decision from serving our customers from putting our capital to work. So we sell VA, we sell our customers today, and they're just made by somebody else. We sell a bunch of fixed annuities today, made by somebody else. So looking forward, what our goal is, is to try to get returns up on the life business. That includes getting capital out of there. That it was about -- we got about -- when you include the bank last year, I think we got back about $367 million. This year, we expect to get more back. I'm setting objectives for Don. And so we're -- we expect over the next couple of years it to be a net generator of capital for us to continue to work to try to reduce the size of the fixed annuity business, and then to continue to focus on helping support the Allstate agencies and the Benefits business. Is that helpful?","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Very helpful. So selling it or spending it off, nowhere near your radar screen?","Thomas J. Wilson","If we could do something with the fixed annuity business, I'd be happy to do it. But there's -- the deals people are making don't look that attractive to me. If we had an attractive way to reinsure some of that and that's not really a spinoff, the way you're -- you're thinking of it in a capital market standpoint. I'm thinking of it how do we get our returns up in that business, and that's our goal, get returns up for Allstate Financial. We'll do it in as effective and efficient of a way as we can.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I was wondering if you could give a sense of what you think ad spend will be for the Allstate brand '13 versus '12?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'm sorry. Say that again, Ian?","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Advertising spend. Do you expect advertising spend to be flat, down, up versus 2012?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'd rather not comment on that because other people listen to the call and figure out what we're doing in the ad spend. I would just underline that Matt is focused on growth. And to the extent we think it's economic, we're willing to invest in it, as long as we can come in with our combined ratio target overall. And it's a pretty -- as you know, it's a pretty aggressive advertising market today but it's also shifting. You're seeing people move out of big ads that are done on major TV to more electronic communications and stuff like that. So we have -- Sanjay Gupta joined us. He's the Chief Marketing Officer last year. We also have a great advertising team with Lisa Cochrane and some others. So feel like we got the right weapons, and we fire them when we think they're going to drive growth.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it, great. And then to the growth question on -- Matt obviously talked a little bit earlier about New York and Florida being important states. But there's -- I'm talking specifically about auto here. There's also challenges in both states. I'm curious just what -- how those are impacting you there favorably","[Audio Gap]","Has that been an impediment to try and to grow? Or do you think you've kind of gotten ahead of the market in figuring out how to address that? And then just New York, with all the losses from auto and Sandy, I assumed there could be price increases coming. How does that affect your ability to grow?","Matthew E. Winter","Well, let's take them individually because although they are typically grouped together, they tend to have some things in common but some things occur differently. Florida is a difficult environment. Due in part by the type issues that you referenced. But it's just a tricky environment, one where you have to be very disciplined, very cautious. And as you grow, you need to do so in a really disciplined manner. I talked at one of the other calls about, the first-mover disadvantage that we sometimes get by seeing things before other see them, in Florida and New York, that's really an advantage. So we watch trends emerge and we stay on top of them very aggressively. So you can see in Florida on Page 23 of the sup that we've continued to improve the margins in Florida as the year-over-year loss ratio ended 2012 several points below 2011 levels. That gives us some flexibility to start looking at growth. We've seen, as I said, stabilization in retention there. But we have to be cautious in the growth area, and we'll do so deliberately and cautiously. So that as we grow and if we're able to grow, we're doing so profitably and not exposing ourselves inappropriately on the risk side. In New York, as you said, Sandy creates some -- we'll take [indiscernible] some of the results. We have to see what happens. Clearly, with some of the requirements that we not terminate policies that influenced the retention rate there, so we have to see how that shakes out. But we're optimistic there, too. You've seen standard auto if there continues to decline but at a slower rate than seen in the third quarter. And if you take out Sandy -- and I think we try to break this out for you on Page 23 of the sup in New York. The loss ratio excluding Sandy improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. So we're seeing, if you x out Sandy, we're seeing some nice improvement there, so we think we're fairly well positioned in New York as well.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","You think you can get enough rate -- just given the moratoriums, you can get enough rate for the cat load type -- probably higher cat load to still grow?","Matthew E. Winter","I can't predict what rates we'll get, what we will take. We strive always to ensure that we have a proper economic return on the business, and we'll manage our relationships there and our rates to ensure that happens.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bob, maybe could you elaborate a little bit on, you mentioned -- we talked about non-cat weather. I think we talked more on the homeowners side, can you talk a little bit about kind of the large loss activity -- or the lack of large loss activity, I should say, in the fourth quarter? How much that benefited standard auto? Just to try and reconcile how everything move out those forward. And then just one follow-up.","Robert Block","The lack of large loss activity favorably impacting auto in the fourth quarter?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Well, you said weather was benign, I guess.","Robert Block","Well, it was. If you look at the frequency trends that we had a nice decrease in the fourth quarter relative to 2011, so the frequency trends continued. That is -- when we look forward is something that we are not necessarily calling on when we look at 2013. I think that everybody in the industry I think experienced a better weather pattern in 2012 than they had in the past 2 years. So I think that's really what we're seeing on that.","Thomas J. Wilson","And the large loss, I think, it sometimes causes us to hesitate, now let's not make the reserving expert. But to the extent, the frequency goes down because of the weather, those tend to be smaller average claims sizes. So as a result of that, your severity tends to go up a little bit when your frequency goes down. So actually the large losses didn't really go down. Somebody's going to get into an accident and really hurt themselves or somebody else. They're usually going to do a weather -- so whether or not as the weather -- variability in the weather tends to take out small [ph]. So I think if you look at pay per premium, where Bob laid out on the site, you get a sense for -- we feel like the fourth quarter is pretty good. We don't think you can always count on frequency being down, and so that's why we depict the numbers we picked.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just one, one piece of the disclosure I was trying to figure out was, so we've got the cats and homeowners and auto and then cats overall, is there -- do you guys disclose or do we have available the cat numbers in the auto segment? And what did that look like in 4Q and maybe for the year? I'm just trying to understand the kind of the underlying there.","Robert Block","The way the supplement was structured this quarter. They reformatted a few things. And one of the things that is not -- is no longer in there specifically is cat losses, other personal lines. Yes, I'm working with the accounting to get that number.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Oh, you are. Okay, great. So will follow up with you, will follow up with you after then. And then just one last quick one, if I could. Investment income, I mean it looks like -- so you're down year-over-year about 7% just on the fixed maturity piece. And I guess there are some being moved to alternatives in equities. But just trying to understand, whether or not that piece of decline should accelerate just given the -- it sounds like some harvesting and some continued repositioning. And how just -- how generally should we think about what you're going to be doing there?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, this is Tom. I think your numbers are correct. We don't want to do a forecast of investment income because of course, everything depends on what happens to rates and the investment rates and how much we decide to reduce interest rate. But I think the general direction you describe is the one we're trying to give you -- I think investment income is likely to, excluding what we get off limited partnerships in the alternative investment, is likely to go down next year because rates are low and we are harvesting gains and reducing our interest rate risk. So the direction is right. Everyone has to make their own estimate as to how much it will go down. Maybe we can -- one last question. I think because we're about at the top of the hour.","Operator","Our final question today is from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Just maybe a question more so to longer-term thinking. Tom, when you think about the 13% ROE goal by 2014, maybe talk about whether or not you need to improve the P&C combined ratio from the 88 to 90, just given maybe some of the pressures of investment income? And if not, maybe talk about the levers maybe outside the life business that you guys have to get your ROE's up to that goal?","Thomas J. Wilson","That's a good question and a complicated one, but I'll try to do it quickly. First, driving profitable growth is our goal and we're highly focused on return on equity. 13% was the goal we set in 2010, early 2010. It is still our goal. Some of the actions we took and had planned on to get there have worked well, and we're on the way there. Other things are not as far along as we would like to get to that goal. We picked 13% because, I don't know if you were at that meeting or not, but because that was the return we had gotten over a long period of time out of the business. So there are 4 key assumptions: One, we can maintain auto profitability; two, we can improve returns and homeowners; three, that we could get the Allstate Financial ROE up to 9% to 10%; and four, that investment income would be essentially flat. We're comfortable with the first 2. Auto profitability is still doing well. We like -- as we said, we like what we've got going in homeowners. And at the time, getting the improvement from where we were to getting to 13%, about 70% of it was in the homeowners business. So we have been like laser-focused on getting that done, and Matt's team has been pushing forward on the work that's really, we've been working on for 4 or 5 years in trying to get there. So that one, we feel very good about, as we feel good about the sustainability of our auto margins. In terms we've made less progress on AF because of the interest rates have come down. And that of course, impacts the third one as well. So we're focused on doing what is economic as well as getting 13%. So for example, lower rates, doing what we're doing to reduce interest rate risks makes that fourth lever even harder to accomplish. So -- but that said, we're going to do what's economic for the shareholders. And if we think it's the right risk turn trade-off, we'll do it. And we are still shooting for 13%. But I'm not going to be a slave to an operating EPS number and put our shareholders at risk for interest rates moving up and unrealized going from $5.5 billion to being wiped out. If we can capture some of that for our shareholders today, we will. So it's a complicated model. We're still working on it. Our goal is to get shareholders a 13% return. There's lots of levers we can pull, you mentioned many of them, and we're working away at it.","Okay, let me just close. So 2012 was a year where you all had the ability to see through cat losses to the underlying strength of our business model. We have a clear and focused strategy which is to differentiate ourselves versus the competition and focus on the needs of each customer segment. We're executing well. We will proactively address any of those challenges that come our way, including the ones we just talked about, with the goal of creating value for our shareholders by doing a great job for our customers. So thank you very much, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Block, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for Allstate's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, we will begin today with some prepared remarks from Tom Wilson, Steven Shebik and me, followed by a question-and-answer session. Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies are here as well.","Yesterday afternoon, we issued our press release and investor supplement as well as our 10-Q for the second quarter. We also posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website.","Referring to the first slide of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Actual results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the second quarter 2012 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. I will be available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have.","Now, we can begin the discussion of our results with Tom Wilson. Tom?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning. Thanks for your interest in Allstate. My remarks will focus on our performance relative to our 2012 priorities within the context of our consumer purpose strategy, and then Bob and Steve will cover their quarter's results in greater detail.","So let's begin on the top of Slide 2. As you know our strategy is to provide unique protection products to each of the 4 consumer segments in the marketplace. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left serves those customers that want local advice and assistance and prefer to purchase competitively differentiated brand of products. In this business, we're successful in introducing new differentiated products such as our Claim Satisfaction Guarantee, Good Hands Roadside, and House & Home, our support of Allstate agencies and marketing programs continue to be expanded with good results, premiums written though were flat for the Allstate brand as our efforts to raise returns in homeowners, negatively impacts retention of home owners, and we have lower new business sales of auto insurance. We did increase the emerging businesses and Allstate Financial products sold through Allstate agencies.","The lower right customer segment is served by Esurance, which we acquired in October to give us a growth platform for self-serve customers that prefer our brand of product. We continue to believe our capabilities will make us a more powerful competitor and policies in force are up this year. The results of Encompass and Answer Financial also improved this quarter.  Our 4 2012 priorities are to create shareholder value by: one, maintaining auto profitability; two, raising returns in homeowners and annuity businesses; three, growing insurance premiums; and fourth, proactively managing investments and capital.","So moving to Slide 3. We had another very good quarter with financial results showing progress in our priorities. On a consolidated basis, we reported net income of $423 million and $432 million of operating income, both significant improvements for the net and operating loss posted last year in the second quarter. The improvement was driven by lower catastrophe losses and a favorable reduction in the underlying combined ratio. While catastrophe losses this quarter were reduced from last year's record second quarter, this quarter's losses were still high versus the long-term average. It reaffirms our 2008 decision to focus on improving returns in our homeowners line.","Book value per share has increased 9.8% this year reaching almost $40. Return on equity for the last 12 months increased 11% on a net income basis and with 11.4% on an operating basis, getting closer to the 2014 goal of 13%. Good progress is made on our 2012 priorities as well. We maintained auto profitability with the Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio of 95.5, which is better than last year's second quarter. Esurance's combined ratio increased, largely reflecting higher advertising expenses, acquisition cost, amortization and catastrophe. There was modest upward pressure on auto loss cost, but this is well within our pricing parameters. Homeowner returns continued to improve with an underlying combined ratio of 64.6, which was 4.8 points better than last year's second quarter. This reflects both our long-term effort to raise prices and improve underwriting selection as well as the moderation of loss cost. We're pleased with the results but recognize there is more work to be done until returns are adequate and sustainable.","Allstate Financial's annuity returns were essentially unchanged economically, but the reported results were higher largely as a result in shift in the location of income from limited partnerships.","Overall, Allstate Financial had $138 million of operating income, which is comparable to last year's quarter on a slightly smaller asset base. Insurance premiums increased in the quarter by 3.8% from the prior year, largely reflecting the acquisition of Esurance and increases in emerging businesses and Encompass. Esurance's policies in force have increased by 13.5% since the beginning of this year, as our new advertising and pricing sophistication resulted in economically attractive growth. The investment portfolio had a total return of 1.8% in the quarter with a small increase in investment income, $27 million in net capital gains and a $442 million increase in unrealized capital gains.","We remain focused on balancing returns and preservation of capital by favoring intermediate corporate credit investments in this low rate, unstable economic environment. We also repurchased $275 million of common stock in this quarter. All in all, good progress on all 4 priorities. Bob and Steve will now provide more detail on the various components of these results.","Robert Block","Slide 4 provides our net premium written and combined ratio for property liability. Overall, premiums written of $6.86 billion grew 3.8% compared to the prior year, a growth rate similar to that of the first quarter 2012, driven primarily by our acquisition of Esurance which continued to grow both premiums and units, as well as positive growth experienced in both the Allstate and Encompass brands. Allstate brand's standard auto net premium written of $3.9 billion declined slightly from the prior-year quarter as auto profitability actions taken in New York and Florida, coupled with actions to improve homeowner returns, continued to hamper overall growth. Excluding New York and Florida, net premiums written for the Allstate brand's standard auto grew slightly from the second quarter 2011. The drop in units was partially offset by an increase in average premium. Retention at 89% was down 2\/10 of a point from last year's quarter driven by declines in New York and Florida, with the rest of the country increasing slightly.","Allstate brand homeowners net written premium of $1.64 billion increased 2.1% from the second quarter 2011. Rate actions designed to improve homeowner returns more than offset the decline in units as average premiums increased 9.2% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2011. In the second quarter, we received approval for rate changes in 7 states averaging 10.2% worth 1.2% on a countrywide basis. In addition to the rate actions, we have introduced our new product, called House & Home, in 9 states, 7 of them in the second quarter of 2012. We're pleased with the results thus far, as early results indicated we are getting a little lift in new business acquisition for both the homeowners and auto insurance.","Within the Allstate brand, the other personal lines, which comprise emerging businesses, posted net written premium growth of 1.8%. We also experienced net premium written growth in Encompass of 5.9%, driven by a substantial increase in new issued applications as well as increased retention ratio. Sequential growth in policies in force was achieved in emerging businesses, Canada, Encompass and Esurance.","On the bottom half of Slide 4, the recorded combined ratio for property liability was 98.0%, a significant improvement from second quarter 2011's 123.3%. A lower catastrophe loss and an improved underlying combined ratio were the primary reasons for the favorable results. The underlying combined ratio was 86.3%, a 1.2 point improvement from the second quarter 2011. Seasonally, the second quarter has produced the lowest underlying combined ratio in every year since 2005.","Moving to Slide 5. We provided the loss trends for Allstate brand's standard auto for the last few years. The top half of the slide displays the gross frequency and paid severity for bodily injury and property damage coverages. After 4 quarters of frequency reduction, both bodily injury and property damage frequencies increased from prior year by 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Paid severities for bodily injury and property damage also increased by 3.4% and 3%, respectively. While this represents a modest increase in loss cost for these coverages, when you include the results for the other coverages, coupled with the impact of an increase in average written premium, the underlying combined ratio improved slightly to 93.4% from 93.7% in the second quarter of 2011. We continued to gain approval for rate changes this quarter with 19 states approved at an average in those states of 4.4% for a countrywide impact of 1.5%.","With maintaining auto profitability being a key priority for us, we added the next slide to give you a longer-term view of this key metric. Since 2001, we have produced strong profitable underwriting margins in the Allstate brand standard auto, averaging a combined ratio over the last 11 years of about 93%. The chart in the bottom of the page gives you the underlying combined ratio since 2008 by quarter and year. While there are some seasonal fluctuation, the pattern of profitable margins is evident. It has been, and will continue to be, very important for us to maintain auto profitability.","Before moving on to homeowner loss trends, we made a commitment to you to provide an update on Esurance. Details for Esurance underwriting results can be found on Page 24 of our Investor Supplement. Growth accelerated in the second quarter with premiums written of $224 million. Keep in mind that seasonally, the first quarter tends to be the highest quarter of the year in terms of premium volume. Policies in force through the 9th [ph] are $892,000, up 13.5% since year-end 2011. The underlying combined ratio was $106 million, including 16.2 points of advertising expense. The reported combined ratio for the quarter was 116.7. Overall, Esurance is performing as we expected.","On Slide 7, we provided charts on homeowner rate activity, loss trends and profitability. In the upper left, we show the countrywide rate effect of the approved rate actions over time. As I mentioned previously in the second quarter, we received approval for rate changes in 7 states averaging 10.2% worth 1.2% on a countrywide basis. So over the last 4 quarters, we have averaged over 8% on a countrywide basis, a level consistent with the last few years.","In the upper right, we displayed the frequency in paid severity trends excluding catastrophes. In the second quarter, frequency declined 6.7% compared to the prior year while paid severity increased 2%. Given these modest loss cost trends, coupled with approved rate actions, the underlying combined ratio shown on the lower left declined by 4.8 points to 64.6%. The combined ratio, the reported combined ratio for the second quarter was still unprofitable at 104.9%. We'll continue to focus on improving the margins in homeowners.","Taking a closer look at the underlying combined ratio for Allstate brand homeowners on the next slide, the top chart provides the results for the underlying combined ratio by quarter. The underlying combined ratio began to improve in the back half of 2011, and continued into the first 2 quarters of 2012. The chart on the bottom of the slide provides some insight into this improving trend. It plots the percent increase in the average earnings versus the underlying loss trend. It also answers the question, \"With all the rate increases Allstate has taken, why hasn't the underlying combined ratio improved faster?\".","First, looking at the earned premium line in red, we observed that the increasing trend beginning in early 2011, one that is more reflective of the approved rate action levels. It takes time for the rate changes to be earned because it's an annual policy. Second, the loss trend in blue, essentially matched the change in year average earns so the underlying combined ratio didn't show much improvement until the last 1.5 years. So the improvement we've experienced in the underlying combined ratio was driven by rates being earned and by favorable loss trends.","Results for Allstate Financial on Slide 9 are reflective of our efforts to improve returns while shifting the focus from spread-based to underwritten products. In the second quarter, total premiums and contract charges increased 2.2% from prior year with underwritten products up 3.1% from the second quarter of 2011. Allstate agencies increased life unit sales with issued policies growing 2.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income of $138 million increased 2.2% from the prior year, helped by the inclusion of equity method limited partnership results this year, as well as lower crediting rates that were partially offset by worse mortality in both life insurance and annuities, lower yields on fixed income securities, and the continued managed reduction in spread business.","Net income of $132 million declined relative to last year, driven by a reduction in net realized capital gains. Operating returns on attributed equity were relatively consistent with the first quarter 2012 levels. Life insurance returns were at 10.8%, accident and health were at 16.3%, and annuities came in at 5.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The overall return was 8.7%, 4\/10 of 1 point better than year-end 2011.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Bob. We continue to proactively balance portfolio yield and return objectives in this challenging, low rate market environment, delivering a total portfolio return for the second quarter of 1.8% on a GAAP accounting basis and 3.8% to the first 6 months of the year.","On Slide 10, we can see the size and composition of our overall portfolio. Improved fixed income valuations, portfolio income and positive cash flows from our Property-Liability business more than offset the ongoing managed reduction of Allstate Financial's spread business. These factors combined to raise the portfolio valuation to $97.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, compared to $95.6 billion at year-end 2011, and $97 billion as of the first quarter.","Our portfolio actions during the second quarter continue to focus on optimizing our fixed income portfolio position on the yield curve, shifting more toward the intermediate term part of the curve and favoring corporate credit over treasuries and equities. You can see the result of these actions, which reduces reinvestment risk, and will preserve capital when interest rates begin to increase in the asset allocation breakout as well as the scheduled maturity profile.","Slide 11 highlights portfolio income and yield trends. For the second quarter of 2012, net investment income was just over $1 billion comparable to the second quarter of 2011, and total portfolio yield was 4.6%, higher than the second quarter of 2011 and consistent with the first quarter of 2012.","Limited partnership results were the primary driver of the favorable variance to the prior-year quarter. You may remember that we've prospectively changed our classification of equity method limited partnership results to net investment income from realized capital gains at the beginning of the year. This brought us more in line with the reporting practices of our peers.","Investment income provided in limited partnerships was $107 million in the quarter, comparable to the total from the first quarter, and $89 million higher than the prior-year quarter. The increase reflects the change in classification as well as an improvement of $34 million in limited partnership performance. If our equity method limited partnership results had not been reclassified, second quarter 2012 net investment income and portfolio yield would have been lower than the prior-year quarter, as seen from the chart on the bottom of the slide, and consistent with the reduction in Allstate Financial's liabilities and lower interest rates.","On Slide 12, you can see that we've realized gains of $27 million in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $30 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our portfolio management actions and other trading activities generated approximately $70 million in trading gains in the sales of fixed income and equity securities, which were offset by $15 million in write-downs for the quarter. Impairment and intent write-downs continue to trend significantly lower than prior year periods. Derivative results reflect reduced usage as we are focusing the management of rate risk in the cash market to portfolio positioning on the yield curve.","We finished the quarter in a strong capital position as shown on Slide 13. Shareholders\u2019 equity of $19.5 billion increased $1.2 billion from year-end 2011. Statutory surplus for both Property-Liability and life remained strong, and deployable assets at the holding company level was $2.3 billion. We continue to buy back our stock, purchasing $275 million during the second quarter. That leaves $319 million on our current $1 billion authorization. Our book value per share hit a new high of $39.73 and the strength of our operating performance improved portfolio valuation and active capital management.","Now, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Quick question on homeowners that I've asked before. What inning do you think you are in the play in this business, and I guess, put another way, how many more quarters do you think we'll be hearing that aggregate premium growth or PIP growth was held by homeowners' actions. It seems like your underlying is getting close to the low 60s this quarter, and your -- I thought the relatively low cat ratio of 12 points versus your peers was an encouraging quarter relative to your cat management programs. So where do you think you are Tom?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, Bob, if nothing else, you're consistent, so thank you for that. As we said, look, this is a business we have about $6 billion of capital locked in. We're looking to get in the mid-teens kind of returns on our capital, so we, obviously, have a way to go. Matt can talk specifically about what we're doing. I will say, I feel very good about the results in the underlying trends we see. Clearly, we had a little bit of benefit, I think, lower fire losses and a few things this quarter, but the geographical focus Matt has brought to the business has been quite good, and he can talk about some of the things he has going there. So, Matt?","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Thanks for the question, Bob. I usually tell people if I could predict the weather patterns, both cat and non-cat, I could tell you what inning we're in. But until then, and since I can't, I can't really give you an answer to what inning we're in. I can tell you how we're approaching the business, though. This may not surprise you, but like politics, this business is entirely local and it's like playing a game of whack-a-mole at the amusement park, everywhere you turn, something pops up and you have to deal with it aggressively. And as Tom said, we've decided that trying to have 1 person with a club managing all of these interactions is impossible, so we pushed some of the decision-making down to the more local level and empowered local management, state managers and people who can watch individual geographies, not just by state but even within a state, to manage and react to trends very quickly as opposed to trying to manage them all from a centralized basis. And so, that has enabled us, I think, to react very quickly to trends as they emerge. So the things that we're watching pop-up may be somewhat unexpected but they're still manageable. And in some cases, we've been able to react so quickly that they don't even emerge as microtrends, much less macrotrends. So we'll continue to approach the game that way depending upon how weather pans out and how a couple of other factors pan out. We'll determine how soon we're through some of the stabilization mode and get into the growth mode that we all want to be in, but we know our task and that's to get rate adequate, manage our volatility, create a sustainable base for growth and then focus on that growth.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Bob, I've been -- we're down about 200,000 policies in the homeowners, I think for 6 months, it's a close number. I don't think you should see that rate of decline change in the second half of the year, in fact it may be a little higher as Matt does some specific targeted actions we've talked about. So we feel good about it, but we're not there yet so we're not yet -- as Matt said, he's not ready to turn on the spigot just yet.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the expense ratio, that's been kind of [indiscernible] which is a good thing. But any sense for -- any specific projects that you plan to reduce expense ratio?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'll make that a general comment and then Don can speak about what we're doing in advertising and Esurance, and Matt can talk about the work he's doing. We, obviously, look hard at our expenses in all combination we expect, and we're always trying to reduce expenses and shift those to where we need to put them. Part of the reason for our increasing expense ratio would be the Esurance increased advertising. We also spent a little bit more money in advertising in the Allstate brand this quarter as well. Matt has a number of programs going on now to simplify and reduce cost. So Don, maybe you want to start, and then, Matt, jump into...","Don Civgin","Sure, Vinay. Of course, Esurance has a slightly different model, business model, than Allstate does, and so much of the expenses are acquisition related and charged upfront. And so, as we have grown the business and that growth has been pretty substantial here in the second quarter, with new policy sales are up over 30%. As that happens, what happens is you're expensing a lot of advertising expense upfront, which obviously has an impact on the -- expected impact on the combined ratio for Esurance. I would tell you the integration is going quite well. The other expenses are coming down as we expected them to, so we're getting the efficiencies and we're getting the savings we expected from the acquisition. We are intentionally spending the money on advertising, quite honestly, because the response has been so strong to it, and we're seeing some very solid growth. So you will see a tick up in the combined ratio, but what's important for you to understand is we are looking at this from an economic combined ratio, and if you allocate those acquisition expenses through the life of the contract, the business that Esurance is writing is combined ratio under 100, so it's actually quite attractive business. On a GAAP basis, it's going to raise the combined ratio for some period of time. But that's what happens with that accounting model and high-growth levels.","Matthew E. Winter","Vinay, it's Matt. So I'll give you a little perspective on the expense ratio and how we're approaching it. We look at this as two prongs. We don't believe that you can manage the expense ratio just by managing down and cutting expenses because if you do that actually, you'll so constrain growth that you'll actually hurt the expense ratio. So we're trying to do a balanced approach to managing the expense ratio through targeted efforts on growth and pruning out all the unnecessary and non value-added expenses in the business, most of that is through simplification of workflows. So I have a team working with my back office right now focusing on removing handoffs, simplifying processes, dramatically reducing service level agreement times and taking out expenses through productivity, as opposed to reducing expenses through other efforts that might impact growth. So we're looking at this in kind of a balanced way. We think we're making some good progress on it, but we don't want to try to cut our way to success there, because we think it will be counterproductive in the long term.","Thomas J. Wilson","Vinay, this is Tom. And if you look forward, and as I know you'll always do, as we look forward to next year, you should expect us to continue to compete aggressively in the marketplace, as both Matt and Don just talked about. We're also going to have to spend more money on technology because all of the customer segments we've talked about, whether they be the Allstate Agency, local advice and assistance, or Esurance are adapting to new technologies quickly. So we're going to probably spend more money on technology as we move forward next year.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. This second question is on PIF. Could you help us understand how you're looking at PIF, as we get into the back half of this year and early next year, especially considering that the new commission structure for agents is going to come up to -- falls on January 1 next year?","Thomas J. Wilson","Maybe I'll make a comment about all the different businesses. Matt can talk about the commission stuff, and maybe Matt, you want to talk about sort of the agency relationships, because that's related to it as well. So obviously, we expect Esurance to keep going, we like what we got there. Don talked about that. Encompass has started to grow but they got a long way to go to get back to where we were, so I'm hopeful they'll continue to push our package policy growth. The Allstate channel we've talked about at length in terms of the headwinds of the homeowners business and what's going on in New York and Florida, we should start to cycle through those. But I don't think you should expect to see dramatic growth in PIF there. Allstate Financial, we continue to make some progress on life sales and the Allstate Benefits business, and then you should expect to see the size, and it's not really related to PIF, but the size of the fixed annuity business continue to come down. We're down about 4% or $1.5 billion so far this year. We would expect that business to keep coming down, if you're just thinking about growth in total of the company. And Matt, maybe you want to talk about that commission structure, agency relationships?","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. I want to make sure I understood the question so if this is not the answer to your question, please follow-up again. But you mentioned the change in commission structure as if that was going to impact PIF and our ability to grow and in reality, the primary change that's taken place in January is a simple variable comp piece that's been drawn in as part of the overall commission structure. And that variable comp piece, that 1%, is earned back by the agents through a series of fairly simple and very controllable actions on their part about physical presence and the location and what it looks like, having sufficient number of licensed sales professionals to support the agent, maintaining continuing education credits, and things that are manageable within their control. And in addition, they'll have the ability to earn an extra 1% based upon customer experience results and customer satisfaction through a survey. So I don't anticipate that the change in commission structure will impact PIF in any meaningful way. My expectation is that it will improve customer experience and align the interest of our agencies and the company and the policyholders together in a more productive manner. The collateral or tangential question you raised is agency relationships, and that has impacted PIF to some extent in that they have been distracted a little bit by the change in commission structure as they were learning it and trying to understand its impact and trying to figure out how to manage their cash flows. We have or had an aggressive agent reengagement strategy underway for the last several months. It began with a fairly massive gathering at the National Forum in Las Vegas where we had over 4,400 agencies present. And the best I would say over 40% of whom had never been to a national conference before, any time in their history of affiliation with Allstate. So we managed to pull together a bunch of people who do not typically have the opportunity to hear from management, learn best practices from each other and share and develop and that was used as an opportunity to give people a chance to ask questions about the new commission structure and the new bonus structure, to learn about it, figure out how they can maximize their own compensation and get their heads back in the game. It's been productive, it hasn't solved everything yet. We understand how important agency morale is. We know it's critical that they understand how much we believe in them, and how much we want them to be successful. And we will continue to work on it and align with them, and our goal and belief is that we can make these compensation changes in a positive way without negatively impacting anything.","Thomas J. Wilson","We did a survey after the event, and the 80% to 90% said, \"We feel good about the company. We think management understands us. We're feeling good about where it could go\", so I'd rather be at 100%, rather than in the 80s and 90s, but if you look at a large geographically dispersed and diverse workforce, we recognize we have room to improve but it's also not as -- you have to listen to the broad set of opinions as opposed to just the noisiest ones.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Just as a follow-up to that. I mean, my concern was just that as you approach the January 1 date, you might get some more requests for dominations from agents, just because they don't want to move to a low commission structure. And should that affect the PIF? So that was really my question.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, well let me clarify. It's not a low commission structure. It's actually an opportunity to earn a higher commission through certain activities in customer satisfaction, and we believe strongly that once they understand that and see how achievable it is and they see their true earnings potential that it will actually be helpful to attracting and retaining more agencies as opposed to a catalyst for departures.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the return on equity goal of 13% by 2014, it seems like you're getting real close to that faster than I would have expected, and probably a lot of other people. Any -- what are your thoughts in terms of achieving that goal prior to 2014?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, we're still 2 points and 19 billion away to go, and so we're talking about $500 million to $600 million by the time you sort through it all. And so we have some work to go. We still feel good about it. Obviously, we have a headwind, which when we made that projection of, interest rates are a lot lower. So we had to work our way through that but we still feel good about getting the 13% by '14. To the extent we get there sooner, will just make our shareholders even happier.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the underlying combined ratio guidance, I struggled to remember whether if it had come in better than your range, if you had changed the guidance over time?","Thomas J. Wilson","I'm not sure, I -- so...","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's coming in better clearly than in the first half compared to the guidance range? Do you -- is there a point at which you might improve the guidance range?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, we put the guidance out there as 88 to 91, there's obviously a fair amount of bouncing around because of frequency, which can move a point on either way, which translates right into a point so I would say, a good frequency so far this year. It is a full year number, don't feel like changing it right now. And it's just one component of what we try -- and you know what? I would really ask you to focus on the 4 priorities we have, and see how we're delivering on those 4 priorities. We provide that guidance to help people do their analysis but as you're well aware, that is only a small piece of what overall results are. It doesn't include catastrophe, it doesn't include investing income doesn't include all of Allstate Financial's subs. There's a lot of pieces missing, so I don't -- I'm not inclined to change it right now because it's a full year number, but I like where we're at. I'm feeling good about the business right now.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then finally switching gears to property liability, net investment income, it was up pretty meaningfully on a link-quarter basis, $352 million versus $313 million, I realize limited partnership had a benefit there but the pickup in taxable non -- the taxable fixed income was also a benefit. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what do you feel of the right normalized quarterly run rate is there?","Thomas J. Wilson","That's a complicated question. Maybe I can get Judy to talk about -- Judy if you'd talk about the difference and also what we've done in repositioning the portfolio into the intermediate part of the curve, what we do with equities and at -- at the end of the first quarter, and then maybe talk a little bit about the role and what we have going on over the next sort of 12 months that might help Jay get through his number.  I don't think -- we're not going to give you a specific number, but Judy can you give those components which will help get you there.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So when you look at it with LPs and without LPs, you're right, we're doing okay in both. I'd say without LPs, it's stabilized as well. And as Tom mentioned, we're doing a lot in terms of optimizing the portfolio and one of the things we did in the first quarter, which we might have mentioned before was that we sold some equities and bought high yields, in the property and casualty company. We like that trade from an economic perspective and it also has helped on investment income on year-to-date and what we've also done is continue to optimize the portfolio on the interest rate curve. So over the past several quarters, what we've done is we've sold near-term maturities and sold longer duration maturities because we're still concerned about long-term interest rates eventually going up and where we've really focused our efforts in the intermediate part of the curve, 5 to 7 year maturities. So that helped us maintain our income but it also have helped preserve the income going forward because we'll have less coming off the portfolio than what we would have had we not done anything.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see, all right. So if I look at that $352 million for the quarter, was there anything in there you'd view as extraordinary in the quarter?","Judith Pepple Greffin","Except for the LPs, I think LPs are more difficult to project and we had a pretty good first quarter in the equity market and that might have pulled some of what we thought was going to happen throughout the year forward. And you have to remember that we've reported those on a lag and the second quarter equity market wasn't as good as the first quarter. So the LP component is going to be a little bit more volatile, but while we're focused on both, yet I think, we've also seen some stability because of some of the actions we've taken in the core portfolio as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So in the prepared remarks, the term moderate was used in regards to the rise in auto loss cost trends. But when I look on paper looks like the rise largely in frequency was somewhat steep. So can you provide color on what could be driving the increase and could you also comment on whether non-cat weather costs were lower this quarter versus 2Q '11?","Thomas J. Wilson","So let me just get to the right page, so where you're looking at...","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think on Slide 5.","Thomas J. Wilson","Slide 5? And you're looking at the gross frequency numbers?","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Correct.","Thomas J. Wilson","I would -- you can -- that's a percent change year-over-year, so I think -- maybe I'll make a general comment on that, we obviously tried to factor in severity and frequency into our pricing. Matt can talk about how he's doing that. I don't see anything particularly abnormal in the second quarter.","Matthew E. Winter","So, it is true that you saw some unfavorable trends there but just remember that 2011 and the beginning of 2012 we're both at the low end of the historical down so the rise looks disproportionate but it is clearly within historical volatility downs. There are certain geographies that were impacted by xCAT weather which drove frequencies higher, such as Texas, where we had a bunch of issues. Not only was Texas the site of 3 of the 4 largest cats but also had a lot of xCAT weather that drove frequency. So as I said, we monitor the quality of our book on a fairly micro basis. As these emerge -- if we can't explain them, or they weren't predictable then we take immediate action to manage them. So we don't feel concerned about it, but we're certainly watching these as they emerge. But as I said, in an earlier response, I think some people have interpreted some of these as large macro trends and the more we look at them, they're very, very locally based microtrends that influence a larger number. Tom and I talk all the time about how averages lie and so we don't look at the overall average number. We look at the micro-targeted local numbers and those are within expectations and within historical bounds.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And next, so $320 million left in the buyback authorization. Is that tracking ahead of expectations and would the board consider increasing the program before year end?","Thomas J. Wilson","The -- it's a little faster than we had originally planned on. We thought the price is cheap. So we kept buying it back and we generated enough capital and have plenty of capital holding at the company level to do that, so we got on top of it early and aggressively. The way we do it is when we get close to the end of the program then we go back, and look at what we want to do a new one. But we typically finish a program then start a new one as opposed to sort of continually increase the size of the existing program. As you know, we've traditionally done that in February when we have a good read on statutory capital for the year and where it came out. Last year, of course, we accelerated that because we again, thought the price was cheap and we're buying it back. As soon as we get down with this one, we'll sit down on the board and look at it again. I think you should expect our philosophy to stay the same, which is if we have capital that's not being deployed in the business, we believe it's the shareholders capital and we will pay that back out to the shareholders. Largely we have done that through share repurchases over the last 15 years. And obviously, dividends eat up about $450 million a year as well.","Robert Block","And we do generally front-end load the programs a bit before the hurricane season. So if you look we've seen basic trends a year ago also.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay and if I can still have bum last one in, it's a follow up to the previous question, caller's question. The new money fixed income yields, if you got a comment on that?","Judith Pepple Greffin","The reinvest yields, for Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial?","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Correct.","Judith Pepple Greffin","So for Allstate Protection, we target again the 5 to 7 year part of the curve, corporates. Right now,  we'd say that's around 2.5 to 2 and 3 quarters and then for AF, it's longer than that, it's more of 7 to 10-year corporates, something over 3%. But remember in AF because the contract holder funds are coming down in the annuity segment. We don't have much reinvest risk there. Really, we're pretty well matched maturities versus what we expect will come off in terms of liabilities.","Operator","Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering if you could possibly give some commentary around what may be your seeing your competitors do, what the peers do in auto? We've heard them indicating severity pressure is a little bit more than you have, so are you seeing more rate actions there?","Thomas J. Wilson","Alison, this is Tom. Matt might want to make some comments as well. We can't speak to specifically what their strategies are. Certainly, the decreases people were taking back in the '08 period of time, when we get -- we don't see people doing that. We see more modest small increases. If you look over a longer period of time, so if you look at our results from 2007 say forward to today, average premium hasn't really gone up much. We've done a much better job of getting our pricing right for our customers on an individual basis. Frequency has been down a little bit, severity has been up, modestly we've controlled it from our standpoint. I think some of our competitors have been recently talking about higher increases, but that's again back to Matt's point, averages lie. If they get a bunch of business in Florida and they messed up, then they've got a raise. I don't know, Matt, if you're seeing anything different in the marketplace.","Matthew E. Winter","No, I can't really comment on the competitors. So I'll just continue to comment on our approach, which is I think really one of the benefits of our structure and the way we operate, which is the locally based decision-making and monitoring by both state managers, controllers, regional senior vice presidents, those teams are able to focus differently and focus more quickly when trends emerge. They also know, based upon the local geographies what to expect. So they know, for instance, when you aggressively push on BI or PIP in some states, BI will pop up next and they are prepared for that and they get ready for that. And so, all I can say is we are managing both frequency and severity and dealing with it through appropriate rate, correct class, the typical underwriting discipline that you would expect to see from Allstate.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Just a couple of follow ups. On the homeowners, Tom, and I think going back to investor day 1 year-or-so ago, the goal was toward the low to mid-60s underlying combined and you're at basically in mid-60s now and you're still taking a lot of rate and loss cost seem to be getting a little bit more favorable. Is it possible you would overshoot that and we could even see better than what your goal is?","Thomas J. Wilson","Ian, thanks for remembering and I would say it's always possible, but probably not likely. One of the things impacting this year is mix. There's a lot fewer fire losses in the first half of this year. Fire losses tend to have very high average severity and so that can rattle through your paids. We also had some high number in paid in the second quarter of 2011. So the decrease is really, because of the loss, the decrease is not as big as it appears to be. So, I think the last quarter Matt said, you thought about 40% was sustainable, 60% was sort of one-time. I don't know what your percentage is this quarter. But I'd say we're happy where we're at, we like where we're going. If we overshoot given the volatility of this business, it's possible some quarters we could make lots of money, but as I think we've said at investor conference, our goal is to take this business from sometimes earning a profit to sometimes losing a profit to always making some money, sometimes a lot of money, not sometimes not so much money, but move it from the plus or minus category to the plus or plus, plus category so that we get a decent return on our capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Great. And then, and switching to the auto side, it seems like there's some concern about rising loss cost trends in the industry. I know you addressed it a little bit earlier. But just within the context of you also as you talked about raising prices, commensurately, do you feel comfortable that the pricing you put through year-to-date has incorporated the loss trend we've seen so far, or are we seeing a little bit of surprise and maybe, we might be behind the curve for a little bit and we have to keep filing for more rate?","Matthew E. Winter","Thanks for the question, Ian, it's Matt. No, we feel comfortable that the rates that we've put in place have reflected the trends as they emerge. Obviously, we don't know what trends are going to emerge tomorrow and next month and if they are outside of the bounds, we'll reflect those in the next set of rate taking or underwriting actions. But again, we haven't been that surprised. BI and PD severities have performed within expectations for the quarter. BI moved with the medical CPI as we would have expected. We did get -- there's been a lot of I guess conflicting information out there about used car prices, ManheimIndex shows a decrease in second quarter after rising first quarter. I know one of the analysts posted something about the CarMax index. So there's a lot of variation and there's things that are transitioning but we feel good about our rates that we've taken. Obviously, some geographies, some states are more challenged in taking appropriate rate and it's harder for us there. And others, we have more flexibility and the ability to accurately reflect what's happening but our goal is, and I would say this not only for auto but for homeowners and in response to your first question, we're trying to charge the right rate. It's all about charging appropriately for the risk we're taking and earning an appropriate margin and providing the customer with a fair value and so we'll continue to try to move with that philosophy.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","And competitively, are you seeing any signs that maybe your close rates are just trying to go up or anything that suggests -- it does seem a lot of your competitors are sort of struggling with this change in loss trend and maybe have to change their appetite. Has that sort of translate through realtime yet, or not so?","Thomas J. Wilson","We've seen some fluctuation in certain states but I would say it's too early before I could comment on it and tell you I see something that's material and sustainable.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Straus of Schroders.","Alan Straus","I was just curious what the weather looked like for July, if you guys have any comments?","Thomas J. Wilson","No.","Matthew E. Winter","We'll do what we always do which is if cat losses are over $150 million, I think it's the third Thursday after the close of the month, we'd put a number out. I think we'll just close in the month right now, so I don't have anything to add to that.","Alan Straus","Just ask a second question, given the capital management earnings are a little bit ahead of schedule, would you expect to go to your board a little sooner than you're expected to for -- to re-up the buy back?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, I think Steve mentioned that traditionally, it was a good addition to the answer that I gave on. In the long term, we believe in giving money back to shareholders. We do it sort of annually. We do try to get ahead of it and then we kind of back off a little bit during hurricane season. We're just headed in -- August, September, October, tend to be the biggest hurricane months. So we probably won't be as aggressive in those 3 months, but yes, as soon as we're done with this one, then we'll, if we have extra capital and the board approves, we'll do another. Yes, I mean -- It's been our -- the amount we bought back, I don't know with the last 15 years, is like over $20 billion. So we believe and if we generate extra capital, then the shareholders should be able to deploy it where they would like to.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I can tell from the numbers though, that your auto only PIF growth is up. You said to me you didn't know last quarter. I can tell you, you are growing on auto only PIF and I'm wondering if you can have some color about growth rates going on and then, and where do you think that's headed?","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, auto only PIF -- or are you talking -- so we have -- we would break it into pieces right? So we have the Esurance piece, which we said is up 13.5% this year. The Allstate brand is down in actual PIF count. Encompass brand is up a little but it's not a -- I think, it's like -- might be $20,000 or something like that. And Canada is up a little. Is there other color other than those component pieces?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So, when you say Allstate brand is down, that includes policy that were non renewed with the homeowner as well as policies that were sold as standalone?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. It will be -- so maybe this will -- if you look at, though -- maybe Matt wants to comment on the growth rate in 3 different categories. So there's Florida and New York, that's one separate auto business. There is -- those homeowner markets where he and his team are hitting it hard to try to get our return back, then there are all other. That might, I think, provide some color for you in terms of helping you analyze where you think that's going to go.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'll take it. [indiscernible] I would like auto only but whatever, go for it. Let's hear the different...","Matthew E. Winter","Well, the good news, Josh is at least we're trying to answer yours. We didn't try to answer Bob's. So let me try to break it down the way Tom suggested. First, New York and Florida obviously, we've -- our auto is -- in both states is, continued to decline. We're focused on margin improvement actions in those states. We're seeing some pockets even within New York, we had a new rating plan put in a few months ago. We're seeing pockets of growth there but when you look at the entire state, you still have a decline. And then as Tom said, if you break down the country and our geographies into those areas where we're taking significant homeowners rate and it's impacting auto growth versus those geographies where we're not taking significant homeowners rate or we're not having significant nonrenewals due to inspections, there is a substantial difference. There's certainly a big correlation between those homeowners actions in certain states and the impact on auto. But it's -- I don't want to overgeneralize and say everywhere that we look at monoline only, we're managing to grow. There are certainly pockets where we are growing and growing nicely. Some of those are due to new rating plans, some of those are due to competitiveness, due to changes from some of our key competitors as one of the earlier speakers asked about. I just -- I would caution you on overgeneralizing anything here. We will have pockets of growth, and as we stabilize the actions we're taking on homeowners, it will free up capacity on the auto side but recall that our target market has historically been multicar homeowners. And so when you take homeowners actions, you're hitting your target market because they bought multiple policies from us. And so, I guess, that's the best I can answer that because I'm not sure. I'm seeing the exact trend you're referring to.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The first one I think you may have answered this already, but the decline in the homeowners frequency that we're seeing right now, how much of that would you attribute it to underwriting initiatives versus just lower non-cat weather going on so far this year?","Matthew E. Winter","I'm not sure, I can give you a percentage. I'd say it's mixed. It's reinspections, correct class actions, nonrenewals, as well as xCAT weather. So I'm not sure I have the breakdown. Bob do you...","Robert Block","I think it's on a quarter to quarter basis. I would say there's -- when you look at the mix as we talked about prior there some stuff, we got to break down for weather and we may not get a breakdown on that next quarter but...","Matthew E. Winter","No, I mean, fire and xCAT is at a 4-year low. I'm not sure we can expect it to stay at a 4-year low on a long-term basis. And so we've been benefited. If I had to guess, I'd say it's a combination of both factors, maybe 50\/50, maybe 60\/40 and I couldn't tell you exactly, which is a 60, which is the 40.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well thank you all for participating today. Second quarter, as we said is a strong quarter despite the heavy weather activity. We achieved progress on all 4 of our priorities, and we look forward to talking next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steven Shebik, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Steven E. Shebik","Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. After the prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and myself, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our press release and investor supplement, posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website. We plan to file our 2013 Form 10-K on Wednesday, February 19.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012 and our 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013, the slides and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.","We're recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I, along with our Treasurer, Mario Rizzo; and Pat Macellaro from Investor Relations, will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now, let me turn it over to Tom Wilson.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time and money in Allstate. I'll start by covering our 2013 results as they relate to our strategy and our operating priorities for both 2013 and 2014. Steve will then go through the business unit results and talk about capital management.","With us today for the Q&A period are Matt Winter, who, of course, leads Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Allstate Business To Business Operations; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","So let's begin on Slide 2. Our strong 2013 results demonstrate success in executing what is a broad and comprehensive approach at creating shareholder value. That includes, obviously, strong operating income; a balancing risk and return; aggressive capital management; and you see accelerating growth as well this quarter, which are all resulting from achieving our operating priorities for the year. Overall, 2013 provides a very solid foundation as we continue to aggressively implement our strategy, which is to differentiate the value proposition between customer segments.","Let's start at the top. Revenues increased 3.6% to $34.5 billion in 2013, which reflects 1.5% growth in policies and, of course, with contributions from all the brands. Net income of $2.3 billion declined slightly from 2012, primarily due to the $521 million after-tax loss from the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life and the impact from repurchasing debt.","Operating income of $2.7 billion for the year was 24% higher than 2012, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. Operating income per diluted share increased 30% to $5.68 per share as a result of higher operating income and the impact of the share repurchases. Book value per common share also increased over the prior year, both including and excluding fixed income, unrealized gains and losses. Operating return on equity was 14.5% in the latest 12 months.","If you go to Slide 3, on the top, we show our 5 operating priorities for 2013. On the bottom, we show the 4 distinct consumer segments we serve through our competitively differentiated strategy, along with the respective growth in profitability. The 3 brands where we underwrite risk, Allstate, Encompass and Esurance, all grew net written premium and policies in force in 2013 compared with 2012, and we achieved all 5 of the 2013 operating priorities.","Starting in the lower left, for the Allstate brand that, of course, serves customers who prefer local advice assistance and want a branded experience, our policies grew in 2013 by 0.4% from the prior year, and Allstate brand auto policies in force increased 1.5% versus year ago and 0.6% versus the last quarter, which reflects both improved retention and continued stronger business growth.","This growth is a result of one, the retention, but also we've expanded the Allstate Agency -- exclusive Agency distribution. We have effective marketing and less restrictive risk targets.","We made substantial progress in improving returns in homeowners. As a result, the decline in homeowners policies was down to 2.2% from year-end 2012 and flat versus the third quarter. The continued rollout of our house and home product across the country will support our future multi-policy household focus.","Overall, Allstate brand profitability improved in 2013, with a combined ratio of 89.9 and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8 due to auto profitability, good underlying homeowner margins and lower catastrophe losses.","Esurance brand, which serves the self-directed brand-sensitive customer, is in the lower right, generated significant premium and policy growth in 2013. Premiums written increased by 27.9%, and policies in force increased by 26.7% compared to 2012. The combined ratio finished 2013 at 117.5, reflected continued high levels of marketing spend you'll remember, and that's where we expense all of our advertising right up front, in investments in expanding both geographically and from a product perspective; continued expensing of acquisition intangibles; and the impact of higher loss ratios on new business.","Esurance continues to adjust its pricing and underwriting to ensure the growth we're experiencing generates long-term profitability. These actions caused growth to decelerate a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, and we expect growth to decline somewhat in 2014.","The Encompass brand, in the upper left quadrant, serves customers through independent agents that provide a choice of brands. Our unique package policy represents about 80% of Encompass' total premium. This brand also grew, with policies up 6.5% compared to 2012. The combined ratio for 2013 was 95.9, an improvement of 10.5 points from the prior year, which was driven by a significant decrease in catastrophes and improved underlying performance in the homeowners line. The auto insurance margins in this brand still need to be approved.","Now, let's move to Slide 4. We have a great year. Now it's time to move forward. 2013's operating priorities are compared to the 5 operating priorities for 2014. The highlight -- the evolution we're going through, which is from focusing on strengthening the core business to positioning for sustainable growth. The operating priority in 2014 on growth is in units rather than premium, as the importance of market share growth is now greater than raising average prices on homeowners insurance.","Secondly, we want to maintain the underlying combined ratio in 2014. This combines the second and third priorities from 2013 and reflects the significant improvements made in the underlying margin in homeowners. Proactively managing investment risk and return remains a priority, although the focus will shift. Now that the interest rate risk has been lowered in the Property-Liability portfolio, the investment focus will shift from public fixed income corporate securities to other high-yielding assets, typically in the private market where returns are not as linked to overall market performance.","The 2014 priority to modernize the operating model is a broader and more sustainable approach to the 2013 priority of reducing the cost structure. We'll continue to take a broad look at improving the way we do business, which means -- and that's, of course, starting with the customer, so we're pursuing continuous improvement, simplifying our processes and streamlining our technology to deliver faster, better and more cost-efficient service. This will lead to improved customer satisfaction and fund further investments in growing our business.","To continue increasing shareholder value, focus is being increased in building long-term growth platforms, so we'll continue to look at ways to become an even more integral part of our customers' lives. The evolution, of course, is a connected customer and telematics, and there's a number of structural and technological changes that offer good growth opportunities for us.","Finally, in keeping with our practice to provide you an outlook for our Property-Liability underlying combined ratio for the next year, that's 2014, we set a range of 87 to 89, which is 1 point lower than last year's range.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Tom. I'll start by reviewing the 2013 financial highlights on Slide 5. Starting at the top, Property-Liability had earned premium of $27.6 billion in 2013, which grew 3.3% from 2012 and a recorded combined ratio of 92. The underlying combined ratio for the year was 87.3, essentially flat to prior year and better than our full year outlook range. Catastrophe losses were $1.25 billion, $1.1 billion below 2012 and our lowest year of catastrophe losses since 2006. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment grew 3.7% from the prior year, reflecting very strong limited partnership performance. As a result, operating income was $2.47 billion for the year, 35% higher than 2012. The combined ratios on a recorded, underlying basis for each brand are shown on the right-hand side. As discussed by Tom, the Allstate brand continued to generate solid profitability as the positive efforts -- effects of rate changes and low catastrophe losses more than offset modest inflationary increase in loss costs.","The Encompass recorded combined ratio also improved from 2012, due to lower catastrophes and improved homeowners margins. The Esurance combined ratio of 117.5 for 2013 improved 2.4 points from the prior year. However, it remained elevated, as Tom noted earlier. Allstate Financial, on the bottom left, had a 5% increase in premiums and contract charges in 2013, reflecting a 5.5% increase in underwritten products, including a 10% increase at Allstate Benefits.","Operating income of $588 million was an 11.2% improvement over 2012, due primarily to an increase in investment margin, lower expenses, profitable growth at Allstate Benefits, partially offset by a reduction in spread-based business and the lower benefit spread in our car and [ph] life insurance. Net income of $95 million for 2013 was significantly lower than 2012 due to the loss on the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","On Slide 6, we show net written premium and policies in force in total and by brand. The red line shows that total policies in force began growing in the second quarter of 2013. For Protection in total in the upper left chart, overall policies grew 1.5% from last year and 0.5% from the third quarter. Each brand achieved growth in both net written premium and policies in the fourth quarter and the full year.","Moving to the upper right chart, Allstate brand policies ended the year 0.4% higher than both 2012 and the preceding quarter. The Allstate brand grew net written premium 3% in 2013, driven by higher average premiums and favorable trends in both retention and new business. Allstate brand auto net written premium increased 2.2% from prior year, while policies rose 1.5% from 2012. Allstate brand homeowners net written premium grew 3.8% compared to the 2012, while the unit volume decline continued to slow, with fourth quarter 2013 homeowners policies flat to third quarter 2013.","On the bottom 2 charts, you can see growth trends for Encompass and Esurance, although remember the absolute dollars scales are much smaller than the top 2 graphs. Both brands grew net written premium and policies compared to 2012.","Moving to Slide 7. The chart on the left-hand side show the earned premium and underlying loss trends for Allstate brand auto and home, while the charts on the right show the combined ratio trends. We have continued to maintain overall margins in the Allstate brand. With Allstate brand auto, you can see that earned premium and losses, which are some of them volatile, tend to move in tandem over time as we closely manage rates to keep pace with loss development. In the last 3 quarters, losses per policy have increased faster than earned premiums, leading to a slight deterioration in margin. Essentially, after experiencing very favorable loss results at the end of 2012, in the first quarter of 2013, moderate increase in loss cost has exceeded the increase in the earned rates. Despite these increases, the underlying combined ratio for auto is still within targeted range and generates extremely attractive returns on capital.","For Allstate brand homeowners, shown on the bottom half of the slide, underwriting loss cost per policy is slightly higher in 2013 than 2012, while earned premium per policy continues to rise. This improved the underlying combined ratio by 2.4 points for 2013 to 62.7. The recorded underlying -- the recorded combined ratio for the year was 77.9, 7.1 points better than the prior year, reflecting the improved underlying margin and lower catastrophes. The combined ratio trends are shown in the lower right-hand chart. You can see our underlying 12-month average continues to decline, but at a slower rate as we approach price adequacy.","Our 2013 investment results, depicted on Slide 8, reflect actions we have taken to reduce interest rate risk in the Property-Liability portfolio, maintain alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile and actively managing our equity investments.","As shown in the graph on the top of the slide, investment income before expenses was $1.08 billion in the fourth quarter and the total portfolio yield was 4.8%. Investment income for the quarter was higher than the first 3 quarters of 2013, but was slightly below the fourth quarter of 2012.","We reported lower income from the interest-bearing portfolio due to lower investment yields and a smaller asset base driven by the decline in Allstate Financial's spread-based liabilities. The equity portfolio continued to benefit from strong limited partnership earnings, which increased by $92 million in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, and partially offset the income decline in the interest-bearing portfolio. The equity component of our portfolio continues to grow. We expect to earn attractive, but more variable returns over time in this component.","Moving to the total portfolio return in the bottom left, our total return for the fourth quarter was 1.1%. Net investment income was a primary driver. Total return for the year was 1.8%, as higher equity valuations were offset by lower fixed income valuations as treasury rates rose during the year.","The level of unrealized gains in the portfolio fell from $5.5 billion at year-end 2012 to $2.7 billion at year-end 2013, as shown in the lower right. The fixed income valuation decline, resulting from the significant increase in treasury rates, was the primary driver of the $2.9 billion decline in unrealized gains for the year.","Our rate risk reduction actions position the Property-Liability portfolio to be less sensitive to rising interest rates and pull forward future income through realization of gains and the sale of longer-term securities, but lowers future operating income.","Slide 9 depicts the trends in the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which comprise of approximately half of the total portfolio. For Property-Liability, on the top left, there's a declining earned yield trend on our interest-bearing portfolio as seen by the gray line, reflecting the interest rate risk reduction activity during the year and reinvestment in lower-yielding, shorter-duration bonds.","The impact of our actions is further illustrated in a scheduled maturity graph at the upper right, where the 2 declining red bars at the longer maturities show that only 10% of our portfolio is due after 7 years versus 32% by the end of last year. While we continue to evaluate our overall investment and portfolio risk exposure, we currently intend to maintain the shorter maturity profile on our Property-Liability portfolio.","At the bottom of the page, you can see that Allstate Financial's net investment income has been more stable. Over the past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows, so the portfolio yield has not been impacted significantly by the low yields in new investments. Future investment income will decline as liability outflows outpace new business and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life is completed.","The last column in the table provides a pro forma view of investment results, exclusive of LBL actual results. The interest-bearing portfolio yield remains essentially unchanged, but investment income is $112 million lower, excluding the LBL-related assets. The chart on the bottom right shows the ongoing decline in the Allstate Financial portfolio as we continue to reduce spread-based liabilities.","Slide 10 shows the progress we have made in improving operating income return on equity from an inadequate return of 8.6% in 2010. We communicated in 2011 our focus on 5 key drivers to increase operating income return on equity to 13% by year-end 2014, as shown on top of the page.","The underlying homeowners combined ratio, which represent over 2\/3 of the expected improvement opportunity, has improved steadily from 72.9 in 2010 to 62.7 for 2013 and 60.7 for the fourth quarter of 2013. Auto profitability has remained stable at a combined ratio of roughly 95%, continuing to generate very attractive returns.","When we established our goals in mid-2011, the expectation for the investment portfolio yield and the Allstate Financial ROE was that interest rates would rise over time. This obviously hasn't materialized as risk durations today are lower than they were in 2011. We have also proactively reduced rate risk in the Property-Liability portfolio, which has been the right economic decision even though it reduces operating income.","We continue on our track record of proactive managing -- management of capital, providing strong cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since 2011, Allstate Financial has returned over $1 billion in capital.","The 2013 14.5% return on equity reflects favorable catastrophe losses. However, normalizing catastrophe losses and adjusting for nonrecurring charges, such as the pension settlement charges, discontinued life reserve strengthening and restructuring charges, as well as excluding Esurance results since we did not own Esurance at the time we established the goal, still leaves an operating income ROE above 13%.","Slide 11 shows our capital position at December 31 compared to last year. We are in a stronger capital position, reflecting excellent earnings, the debt refinancing, changes in employee benefits and the replacement of higher-cost debt with capital that is longer term and has more flexibility, such as perpetual preferred stock.","In the fourth quarter, we returned $565 million to shareholders, to bring the total to $2.2 billion for the year. We repurchased 1.8% of our outstanding common stock in the quarter, or 8.4 million shares, bringing the total repurchase for the year to 7.8%. As of year-end, we had $139 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","As you know, we typically review our capital plans in the first quarter, following completion of our year-end reporting. We estimate year-end statutory surplus to be a total of $18.2 billion with $15.2 billion estimated for the Property-Liability companies. During 2013, Allstate Financial companies returned $774 million of capital, including $500 million this quarter. Holding company deployable assets were $2.6 billion at year-end. If you scan down this slide, you can see our strong capital position at the beginning of the year is even stronger today.","Overall, in 2013, we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and achieved all of our priorities. We are well positioned to aggressively implement our differentiated strategy, while delivering strong returns to our shareholders.","Now let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","It seems like you have achieved your homeowners goal in the low 60s. Where do you stand on your overall homeowners strategy going forward?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, this is Tom. I'll make a comment, then Matt can talk about what he's doing to turn the line on homeowners. And I know you've been after us several times, wanting to declare a victory at homeowners. We feel really good about where it is now. If you look at the underlying combined ratio, it's in a good place. It's taken us 4-plus years to get there, and we're now positioned to be able to leverage in this competitive advantage. Matt can give you some sense of how he's going to do that.","Matthew E. Winter","So I've mentioned previously that we kind of have a 4-pronged approach to the way we're looking at the homeowners business and our strategy going forward. The first was the rate adequacy component which, as you and Tom have been talking about and as you've been mentioning on previous calls, we have made substantial progress on, and we feel really good about our rate adequacy right now, although as things develop and change, we'll develop and change. But that's only one component of our strategy. The second component was to update and upgrade some of our product availability, which we did with House & Home, which you know we've rolled out to a substantial part of the market. We launched it in about 27 states so far, which is about 3\/4 of our new business apps, and we'll continue to roll that out into some additional states this year. The third component of the strategy, though, was to reassess our probable maximum loss and do what we call PML optimization, and figure out if there are ways to use that PML capacity in a more optimized way that enables us to grow households and enables us to get benefits of diversification. And so we've done a lot of work with our PML, we've done a lot of work through reinsurance and we've done a lot of work on a very localized basis to ensure that we're able to take on some additional homeowners capacity without really raising our overall risk load. But the fourth component of it, of the strategy, is just general geographic diversification. We know that the more we're able to grow in certain areas of the heartland where we have non-correlated risk to some of the coastal areas, it gives us overall homeowners capacity. And so there's a lot of work underway to increase that geographic diversification, grow in some areas of the country where we have not historically grown and, therefore, enable us to grow additionally in some of the regions where our capacity is constrained. And all 4 of those prongs are enabled by our brokerage strategy, our Ivantage strategy, which allows us not to hurt the customer as we do all those things. So we always ensure we have a homeowners product offering for our customers and for our agency owners to offer to customers while we're changing things, assessing risk, adjusting PML. And so we've done a lot of work with our Ivantage Agency and Northeast Agencies to ensure we have homeowner product availability throughout the country.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Thoughtful answer. Your third prong, in an environment where there's less -- where reinsurance costs are going down, are you taking the savings to the bottom line or using it to grow?","Matthew E. Winter","Yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A little bit of both?","Matthew E. Winter","I don't mean to be flip. But first of all, reinsurance prices change over time. It's hard to rely on what the arbitrage may be over the long term and so you have to be thoughtful and, I think, disciplined in how we choose to use that and how we choose to think about that in either reinvesting it or taking to the bottom line. So I think we're taking a fairly balanced approach. We may be reinvesting some of that savings and using some of it to enable us to enter areas where we haven't been able to enter before.","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, it's Tom. Remember 2 things as well. So you don't just take change in reinsurance pricing and pop it into the combined ratio, which is we have a stacked program, so it rolls out over 3 years. And we -- reinsurance factors into our pricing, so on a long-term basis, to the extent reinsurance costs went down, we'd be able to offer our customers more value. We would make that up by growing better but -- so it's not sort of just an expense that comes or goes.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, do you guys have an estimate or an idea on what the potential January losses may be for the first quarter?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, we do not, no. But, of course, you know, we do provide -- we'll do our normal monthly cat estimate, which is, I'm not sure, third week is it?","Steven E. Shebik","It'll be third week, Thursday.","Thomas J. Wilson","It's the Thursday of the month. So that'll be coming up.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then one question on -- how much of the increase in the year-over-year expense ratio was due to the incentive comp?","Thomas J. Wilson","On the year-over-year basis, I'd say less than 0.5 point in total, but incentive comp's like everybody, like not just management, agency, bonuses, I mean, there's a lot of people who are incented to drive growth and profitability in a company. There was a little bit of a bump. It was more than that in the fourth quarter, though, because we had some catch-up because there was a pretty good, strong run for the finish line.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And I mean, is there any way to control for that piece or -- so we understand? Is there any way to kind of think about what it might have been excluding that piece, just to try and think about what the forward might look like?","Thomas J. Wilson","I think the best way to look at the underlying profitability is just to look at the loss ratio piece. The expense ratio will move around depending how much we're advertising in the quarter and those kinds of things. We do expect the expense ratio to come down over time, though.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, so, I mean, clearly taking rate in homeowners seems to be slowing. I don't know if that's the right interpretation. Do you expect to see -- do you think you can continue to see the trend's moving in the right direction as you continue to push for rate and maybe see some margin expansion there?","Matthew E. Winter","Mike, I'm sorry. This is Matt. Were you referring just to homeowners there on rates?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, most. I mean, if you can comment on auto as well, but I was mostly talking about homeowners, yes.","Matthew E. Winter","Okay. Well, if you look at Page 17 of the supp, you can see that the impact of rate changes on premiums written over the last several quarters broken out by auto and home. And as I said in my earlier comment to Bob, we have neared rate adequacy. Remember, as we roll out House & Home for the vast majority of states, that goes in rate adequate right away, so that has helped us jump to a rate-adequate position early. But we're -- we operate on a localized rate-taking basis. So we watch loss trends as they emerge on a local basis, and we react on a local basis. They -- so looking at it on a system-wide perspective is hard to do and I think a little misleading. When we see issues arising in a loss cost in a region or in a state, we react quickly in a region or in a state, and we'll take rate as needed. We've done a lot of work. We know the importance of customer experience and momentum. And a lot of work was done over the last several years to factor in customer experience and momentum into the decisions we make about when we take rate, how we take rate and how fast we take rate. And so we'll continue to balance that to optimize the overall return, the overall customer experience and our growth capabilities and our ability to retain our existing customers.","Operator","Our next question is from John Hall from Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tom, yes, I was just wondering if you would just talk a little bit about the profit run rate for Esurance, sort of the time line? And then whether that's truly a top line phenomenon, or whether there's an element of overspending that's going on in Esurance? And then, just sort of tail onto that, whether you have any success metrics that you could share around your post-Super Bowl insurance ad.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. I'll answer that, and then Don can help me out as well as since he works directly with him. First, impressive report quickly. I mean, fast turnaround. I was like, you must have had that thing all filled out and just dropped the numbers, and I have to say, I was quite impressed. The -- but as it relates to Esurance, let me go up to the strategy. Don can get into sort of the runway on the profitability. But when we bought it, we thought we were a better owner because we could do a number of things. One, we could reposition the brand specifically targeted towards that self-directed customer. We did that. The first phase of that was to not have it be used -- appeal to both segments, which was people when you want them and technology when you don't. That's obviously trying to appeal to both ends of that spectrum, which they needed to do because of their size, and we did not. So we repositioned it, really, around that self-serve customer, and Don can talk about the work they're doing in marketing there. But that was the first thing; reposition the brand. Secondly, to strengthen the brand by endorsing it with Allstate, so, in fact, we've done that by having it be endorsed but not confusing with the Allstate brand. We also thought we were better at claims and preferred pricing. And it was based on those assumptions that we said we could get in and invest more aggressively to drive growth in the business. So we substantially increased the marketing spend, even though that has a negative impact on the overall combined ratio because we can handle it given the size and scope of our company. And the result of that, as you see, we have great top line growth over the last couple of years with that business. Now, of course, all -- good plans always have something that you got to adjust to. And so they have -- we -- the loss ratio is a little higher than we would like. And so Don and Gary Tolman and the team are working to get that and he can give you some insights on both what are we doing with the current marketing program and what are we doing to get loss cost in line. But I'm okay. As long as the loss cost is in line, I'm okay continuing to invest in growth in the business, even if it brings their specific component combined ratio above what we would like on a long-term basis.","Don Civgin","John, let me maybe just fill in a couple of things on both the profitability trajectory and then the marketing. I mean, as Tom said in the opening comments, you have to look at both the GAAP profitability, and then what we look at, which is economics. Because we direct -- we expense all the marketing expenses upfront, particularly in a business that's growing, and Esurance is obviously growing very rapidly, the GAAP combined ratio is going to be elevated during the points at which you're growing the way we are. We would prefer to not just look at GAAP, but also look at our economics, which is the way we run the business. So we look at the lifetime combined ratio that the business that they're writing today is generating. And I'll talk about the loss ratio in a second. But by and large, we're comfortable that the business that Esurance is writing right now is profitable over its lifetime. You won't see it in the GAAP accounting because it -- because of the expensing of all of the advertising expenses upfront. On the loss ratio, I think Tom's right. We're all a little disappointed with the loss ratio this year. We've been on it, we understand where it's coming from. Where we can, we've worked with Allstate, shared data and make sure that we're on top of it. I think Gary and his team has done a really nice job of working to make sure that through both pricing, which you'll see in the supplement, you will see the rates being taken, and underwriting actions, that, that will come back in line. And we're already beginning to see the loss ratio come back in line. So I would expect to see improvement in the loss ratio in 2014 compared to where we were in '13. But I think so long as the business continues to justify the advertising spend, you will see an elevated combined ratio on a GAAP basis. Just one word of caution: you saw in the third and fourth quarter, the top line slow down a little bit for Esurance as a result of some of the rates that have already been taken, and I expect to see continued pressure in 2014. The way they're taking rate and moving underwriting, 2014 would be difficult to maintain the trajectory on the top line that they had in 2013. Let me move to marketing for a second. After we made the acquisition, I think Gary and his team did a really nice job of fashioning a new campaign that was designed. It was called the Insurance for the Modern World campaign. It was designed to make sure that everybody understood what their customer value proposition was. So, if you go back to our four square, that advertising campaign was designed to make sure people understood that Esurance was in the lower right-hand and not competing against Allstate. That campaign was terrifically productive, extremely strong response rates and you can see from what it did on our top line, it worked extremely well. The Esurance ad after the Super Bowl was a little bit of a shift in that instead of telling people we're in the lower right-hand, we're now going to telling people how good we are at the lower right-hand. And that was the way to kick off that shift in the campaign. We're extremely happy, not only with the impressions we got and the -- I mean, if you read any of the social media reviews, it was extremely effective in generating Twitter activity after the -- not only after Super Bowl, but up until last night when the announcement was made in the Jimmy Kimmel show on the winner. And so I think it's worked extremely well. And what I like in particular is that the credit the team's getting for the campaign is extremely consistent with what the brand stands for, which is clever, modern and doing things different than it's been done in the past, so feeling very good about the marketing campaign. We're investing in it. We'll see how it works, but I think we're delighted with the way the -- as the ad and after the Super Bowl worked for us.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Was there an immediate response in terms of call volume?","Don Civgin","Yes, there were -- well, you have to separate that from call volume to quote volume, so quote volume was up substantially after the Super Bowl ad. Call volume was off the charts. A lot of that was, obviously, to learn about the contest and so forth. But the response was really good.","Thomas J. Wilson","We spent a lot of money. People should call.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On capital management for 2014, any outlook there? In 2013, you guys, if I do the math on share buybacks and the dividend over operating earnings, you guys returned in excess. How should we think about 2014?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, you should think about it as one of our core values for our investors is generating good cash returns for them. So we started to talk about cash returns a little differently this quarter. So we talked about the combination of dividend and share repurchases, and what does that look like as a percentage of one's market capitalization. And the concept behind that is if you owned the entire company at the beginning of the year and you owned the entire company at the end of the year, how much cash would you have gotten in between? And sometimes, I think the share repurchase numbers get lost in the fact that you could choose to maintain your relative ownership interest as a shareholder by selling pro rata into the share repurchase program getting that cash and that cash looked like about 9% last year, and it looked similar to that the prior couple of years. So that is still our goal. As Steve said, we evaluate that in the first quarter. We're not prepared to make an announcement on what we're doing in dividends or share repurchases on this call, but you shouldn't expect a huge change in our philosophy in terms of driving shareholder return and providing cash to them.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's interesting. Next and lastly, a follow-up to one of the previous questions. Now, if we look at Slide 7, auto loss cost seemed to be exceeding earned premium for the last few quarters. I mean, should we be expecting another tough comp in 1Q given what's been going on in January? And maybe if last year -- if 1Q was a tough comp as well and on cat weather?","Thomas J. Wilson","I don't really want to get into quarterly forecasts on it. I can tell you that our general philosophy is one mantra [ph], which is manage it locally, but also there's the be paranoid about it. So the reason you maintain good returns is you stay focused on it. Matt can talk about what they've been doing in the last half of last year to reflect the trends you just mentioned.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes, thanks, Tom. Yes, Mike, I'd rather focus on, as Tom said, how we manage this. And so when you look at Slide 7 and you look at that chart, I'd just remind you that this is a percent year-over-year underlying margin trend. And so what we just saw is a comparison to what was an extremely favorable fourth quarter 2012. That notwithstanding, we do have some clear pressure emerging. And you see slight uptick. We think it's still within our expected norm and our historical norms on the severity side on BI and PD. But it is just kind of volatility that's normal and somewhat expected. That being said, what we see on a system-wide basis is different than what we see on a localized basis. So, if you go back to Slide -- Page 17 of the supp, you'll see the number of states we put rate in during the second half of the year on auto. It's significantly higher than what we took in the first half of the year. We saw some trends emerging in some particular states, and, as such, we took necessary rate to ensure we got out in front of those and caught up quickly and minimized any lag between the earned premium and the increase in loss cost. We also took some underwriting actions and we accelerated some correct class work in the second half of the year that I anticipate will have a positive impact as we begin this year.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Johnson of Citadel.","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Wanted to talk about a segment that's actually sizable enough to talk about, that's on the other personal lines, the underwriting improvement there was, I'd say, just about as meaningful as it was in the auto business in terms of year-over-year contribution. What's the outlook for that continuing? And now that Don's not there, who's running the business? And I got one other follow-up after that.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay, Dan. The -- as you point out, yes, we are doing better in what we would call consumer household stuff, which includes a variety of other Property-Liability products. The business is -- profitability has improved. We'd like to see it grow a little faster to be honest. Its growth was moderate. And when we look at the potential market share, the market share we have in those spaces, whether that be motorcycle or RV or boats, and we look at our overall market share in auto and home by state, we have some room to grow there. And we'd like -- so we're working on having a more household focus. Kathy Mabe is the person who runs that part of that business. She -- oh sorry. Sorry, we moved it over to Matt, I'm sorry. I'm saying Kathy and Matt's saying, \"Oh no, I got that one.\" Kathy Mabe took over for Don, so all the Encompass stuff and all the -- we've rearranged some stuff called business-to-business and I'll come back to that in a second. So Don left. Kathy took his role. We re-shifted that role somewhat. We have some fairly large set of businesses that are good at business-to-business, but they weren't really run together as business-to-business. So, for example, we have our worksite business which serves 2.7 million customers through the worksite. We also have a commercial insurance business, small businesses. There's a bunch of things that are really business-to-business, and we felt like we weren't delivering it really seeing a value proposition to those businesses as we could have. So we put those together and reorientated that right as Don was leaving. As part of that, we took the consumer household business and we moved it into Matt's organization, so that it's more integrated on the household focus from both pricing, technology standpoint, a whole bunch of reasons that'll help it grow faster.","Dan Johnson - Citadel LLC","Yes, well, that was actually my next question as to now that we've got it to very respectable profitability, can we grow it? So maybe I just ask it slightly different. Are we sort of at profitability where we hope to be and then the focus needs to be from growth? Or is there still other things on the profitability front that you think can be done? And that's it.","Matthew E. Winter","Dan, it's Matt. So, on the profitability side, again, when you see it, it's rolled up to all the lines together. And we still have some additional work to do on a few of the smaller lines there to ensure that their profitability is sustainable. Remember, some of the profitably improvement we saw in this last quarter was driven primarily by low cats, and so we don't want to declare victory too soon there. The way we're approaching these lines, as we move them over from what was emerging businesses into personal lines, is I consolidated things with wheels with the auto line into the vehicle line management, and I consolidated landlord, renters and condo and manufactured homes into our homeowners business. So they're being managed more holistically by what is now vehicle and home -- or vehicle and property line management. I expect that, over time, as we ensure that we have profitability on each of the subcomponents of those CoHo lines, that we will, consistent with our CVP, begin growing the overall portfolio. Remember, our overall approach with the Allstate Agency now is to say yes more often to customers, have more products available to serve their customers and enable those agency owners to be more holistic risk advisors to their customers and have a variety of products at their disposal. As we continue to embed that CVP into the agency system, we think that the ability to sell some of the consumer household products will improve. Our breadth and depth of customer penetration will improve as a result, and we will get better at packaging them together, porting data between the lines, making it more intuitive for a licensed sales professional to switch from a standard auto sale to a renter or a condo sale and port data over. And so we're excited about the opportunity. We think the integration into the rest of the personal lines business, the auto and home business, will be a long-term strategic benefit to us.","Thomas J. Wilson","Dan, this is Tom. Let me -- I want to add one thing to that because I think you're on an important point from a strategy standpoint. This is really a shift from a product and items in force strategy to a household strategy focus. And our metrics don't quite follow it. We show you items in force by product and that kind of stuff. But -- and it's really in line with a customer focus. So some of our competitors only have one line, right, and we have to compete heads-up with them. But we're more interested in selling everything we can sell to you. So if you thought of this as a retail store, we don't just want to sell shirts. We want to sell shirts, pants, shoes, socks, whatever you need. We want to give to you, because we think that speaks to that customer segment. And Matt talked about it there. We're also doing the same thing in Esurance. So Esurance, we've rolled our renters in 16 states, motorcycle in 3 states and homeowners in 1. So you should expect to see -- we think that gives us a competitive advantage in that space because we'll be able to leverage our relationships and marketing dollars over a broader swath of products and services, have greater retention from people because we sell more things. So it is about shifting to that consumer -- customer focus, and this is, of course, one part of it.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I wanted to talk briefly -- so we oftentimes don't talk about your agents. You obviously have a lot of them, they're sort of essential to the story, but I think they get lost a bit. 3 or 4 years ago, you guys made a whole bunch of changes, lots of new blood in the organization, some consolidations, new agency, behavior and management strategies and compensation. You're obviously starting to see some core growth in the channel. And I'm curious if what you learned from the various initiatives you've pulled and if some of the growth that we're seeing is kind of you guys getting some traction from, like for example, the new blood and new hires and things like that? And whether -- or whether this is -- or whether the growth is something that's just a bit more cyclical as opposed to structural that we can look at?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, Josh, thank you. As you were talking about [indiscernible], this is my eighth year as CEO. The last one was a lot more fun than the first 6, and we've made a lot of progress. I was -- as it relates to our agency owners, they're never lost. They're a key component in that which we do and very vital to us. As we've talked about before, that it -- we did -- when we went through the homeowners refit and we had to refix homeowners, lean a little heavier on auto, we decided to, at the same time, go and strengthen the agency distribution force, do a whole bunch of things, and Matt can talk about what he's doing there. I would say that I am very proud of the work that our team has done to improve the relationships with them, help them be more successful and that is part of what's driving growth. It isn't just about not selling more homeowners -- or about selling more homeowners and not taking as much rate. That is, of course, part of it. But it's also about getting the system position. And so we have that kind of period of time for a couple of years where we have to kind of regroup, build our foundation and they've taken it to a new level. So, Matt, maybe you want to talk about how you feel about agencies, what their investing in and how it's driving growth.","Matthew E. Winter","Thanks for the question, Josh. I love getting questions about agency owner and distribution. It's, I think, one of our core strengths as a company and one of our competitive advantages. We get a lot of work on reengaging the agency system. As you mentioned, we had a tough transitional period. We had to do some hard work as a company to change and improve the productivity and efficiency of the agencies. Some of that involve compensation changes to shift towards more variable compensation, to spur and incent growth and give them a reason to take a leap of faith and invest in their agencies, even though, at that time, they were declining in size. And we had managed, through that new compensation program, to completely bend the line because they did take that leap of faith. They invested in their agencies. They hired licensed sales professionals. They increased their marketing. They invested in technology. They totally reengaged and, as a result, they are now growing items in force and their agencies are more valuable, our system is more valuable and we're thriving together. That brought together a bunch of work. It brought together technology work, marketing work, compensation work, workflow reengineering to make the products more intuitive to sell, a lot of great product work, and that has yielded a couple of tangible results. So I think on the last call, we mentioned that the agency relationships survey, which is a survey that measures their level of satisfaction and confidence in the system, is at an all-time high. If you see on Page 11 of the supp, and you'll see more detail in the 10-K when it's released, we're growing the number of agencies. And that trend was going down for several years and now it's increasing because we're adding points of distribution, and they, in fact, are adding additional licensed sales professionals. Our EA retention is significantly higher. The previous couple of years, we experienced retention rates that were at about 80%. In 2013, our EA retention was 92%. That means fewer of them are leaving the system, there's less disruption to our customers. It builds on itself. So all of these things, the momentum on the growth side, the momentum on new business side and retention, along with what I call sustainability metrics, which are the number of agencies and the productivity and efficiency in those agencies, should all work together to improve the overall growth of the system. So the short answer to your question is I think it's very structural. I don't think it's cyclical, and I don't think it's a short-term thing.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful, Matt. Just one other sort of question. Long-term, if you guys think about sort of 5 years, we're trying to think about what the Allstate of the future looks like, homeowners is -- arguably, maybe that's cyclical, maybe that's structural, it's a much more profitable business today, and you guys have shrunk your footprint by something approaching, gosh, maybe 30% in terms of PIF since 2005. The question is, is if you think bullishly, how big could you get that business in -- over some extended period of time? And then second, Esurance, you're still sort of getting your legs and -- but your investments, thus far, it's been kind of modest in terms of ad spend and, obviously, that's turning the corner. If you look forward 5 years, how material a part of this business do you think it may be?","Matthew E. Winter","How material...","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would Esurance be as a function of the total Allstate franchise?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, I'd like them all to grow as fast as they could grow, so I'd take the same percentage in higher growth in total or I'll take higher percentages on either. But I think if you want to go, really, 5 years, I would start to think more about just telematics, connect to customer, the way in which we interact with our customers. We have a different approach to telematics. We're still developing it is. But telematics, of course, is our Drivewise and DriveSense. It does one thing, which is give better pricing, gives you the ability to do better pricing because you have more data about individual customers. Our offering, though, also is trying to enhance the customer value proposition. We haven't sorted out exactly what that means yet. But if you were to look over 5 years, I think you would find that the types of services, information and relationship we have with our customers will be stronger and more valuable to them and should enable us to grow. So I think you're -- really, in the next couple of years, you should see them to grow in what is economical. And as we think we have the skills, capabilities and performance to grow, I don't really want to talk about just homeowners or the other pieces.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just to follow-up on the auto, the standard auto loss ratio, looked like it did tick up a bit on the fourth quarter, as you mentioned. Is some of that just sort of an accident year true-up, just looking at the trends developed and you saw it and sort of caught up? And number two, you mentioned you're seeing modest pressure and severity. Also, looks like frequency is maybe normalizing. Could you talk about what you're seeing on the frequency side also?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes. So as I said, the tick-up that you're referring to, we just consider kind of some normal volatility. There is some embedded pressure on the severity side. I think frequency is relatively stable and it's performing well within the historical ranges. So there was a little PD uptick. But remember that 2012 was actually below the historical range. So we look at that, and there's nothing to be worried about. We looked at the new to renewal ratios, because as we're growing, we would expect some pressure on our frequency there. But actually, it hasn't emerged yet. The faster we grow, that becomes somewhat inevitable, but we're monitoring it closely and we'll stay out in front of it. And again, on the severity side, it's slightly elevated. You look at the 2-year average growth, though, on like PD paid severity, and it's fairly moderate. And so I think it's somewhat -- I know what you're trying to do. Everybody's trying to see whether or not a trend is emerging. And so you have to look at like the last 2 quarters or year-over-year. But we have to do that and balance it with what it looks like over a 2-year period, understanding that there's some volatility in there. And again, you're seeing it on a systemic basis, and we're trying to look at it on a very localized basis. We're able, I think, on a very localized basis, to distinguish better between what is just normal volatility and what's an emerging trend. And we jump on anything that looks like it's an emerging trend, and we wait out what looks like normal volatility.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And one follow-up. On the overall expense structure, I mean, the business historically ran closer to 25 and clearly, been edging up more in the 26s now. I mean, is the reality -- is it just more of an expensive business today than it was 5, 10 years ago?","Matthew E. Winter","Adam, it's changed. I would say that you're right and you're absolutely correct in the percentages, but there's more money being spent today in marketing than there has been in the past. We are spending less money in certain categories. And in many categories, we cut cost to invest in other things. So if I look at total technology spend, we're spending a lot more money in technology and simplifying cutting expense out, which should lead to both improved customer experience and lower cost in the future. So it bounces around. We're always about, though, trying to reduce cost. This is a relatively thin margin business. It's low involvement business from a customer standpoint, so they don't like to pay for something if they don't have to. So we try to look at everything and say, \"Will our customers pay for it?\" So I think in terms of -- we don't have like a magic goal. I think the answer is how do you deliver the most value to customers and split your money up? So if we have to spend 0.5 point in expenses and we think that it gives us ability to charge another percent in average price, we'll do that, because -- and so we're not going to manage just the expense ratio as a way to grow the business. It's all about what the customer wants. But it shifts around a little bit. A lot more money in marketing these days. And then the mix changes with Esurance in there and you got to kind of break it out between Esurance -- really the 4 segments should stand on their own as it relates to expenses because that's what you're paying to deliver the service to that specific customer.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wondered, could you give us an update on Drivewise and how that's doing? And any plans for '14 to push that product, maybe more ad spend or something?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, I will, Brian. And, Matt, I think this is the last call. I didn't realize we're having some -- getting good questions and we went a little over time, so I apologize to those of you who have other things to do. So yes, we have 2 offerings in the marketplace; Drivewise and DriveSense. First is the Allstate brand; the second is the Esurance brand. In the Allstate brand, we're over 300,000 units on the street today, and we stay connected in our offering versus some other offerings, where they take it back. Not everybody does. But there are 3 components to that which we're trying to do. One is, better pricing. It's every bit as powerful, I believe, as credit was when we got started. Second, it will be about enhancing the customer value proposition. And third is how do we use that data to help our customers do even more and pay less? So there's 3 components to it. We're -- we are -- we have what we call V 1.0 out in the marketplace today, which is the product I just mentioned that's in the cars. We are working on some other alternatives this year that we'll be investing a substantial amount of money in this year to test and decide how we want to take and grow that property. We call those affectionately 2.0, 3.0. And so we have a group of -- a team that's working on innovating there. We're connected with all the OEs on -- in terms of what they do. I think we'll probably end up with a different strategy for the OE market than the aftermarket. And, of course, the aftermarket is where most of our customers are. So that will start to roll out and we'll talk about it as we go through the year. But it is important to us, and we're spending lots of money on it.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then one other just quick one. Can you talk about what potential impact the ACA may have on your supplemental health business as we kind of look forward here and voluntary products going to those exchanges?","Thomas J. Wilson","It's a relatively small impact on the business. There are some product things we have to change, but it won't -- it's not a meaningful item for us in that business or obviously, for the whole company.","So thank you, all. Last year, you saw us. We began to shift from improving returns to accelerating our strategy, which is, of course, to grow by providing differentiated value propositions to the 4 customer segments. We really are now positioned for growth. We've got a good, solid strategy. We've got brands, we got the business capabilities, we're executing well. We have the financial resources and, as importantly, we have a great team between our management team here and our agency owners. So we are positioned to both grow and continue to provide cash returns to our shareholders.","Thank you, all. I will talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program.

As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","And now, I would like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Griek","Thank you Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. And Jess Merten, our Chief Risk Officer, has joined us today to discuss how we evaluate risk and return decisions and use economic capital to allocate resources and establish performance targets.","As noted on the first slide of this presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate.","Let's begin on slide two, with Allstate's strategy to profitably grow market share and protection products. Starting with the upper oval, the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and provides protection by ensuring automobiles, homes and other property. We have four brand. Differentiated products, sophisticated analytics, telematics and are building an integrated digital enterprise to grow market share in this protection space.","Our strategy also includes expanding by protecting people from a range of other uncertainties such as shown in the bottom oval, by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution, claims capabilities and capital. Collectively, these businesses on the bottom oval have tremendous value, which often gets overlooked by investors who focus only on the Property-Liability businesses or on earnings per share.","Our strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.","Moving to slide three. This strategy is driving growth and attractive returns. Policies in force increased for the Allstate and Esurance brands, Property-Liability businesses. SquareTrade had outstanding growth. Total policies in force now exceed $123 million. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio was 84.2% in the first quarter. Total return on the investment portfolio was strong at 4.7% for the last 12 months but reported income declined this quarter due to lower valuations and limited partnership portfolio.","Net income was $1.26 billion, as you can see from the chart on the bottom, reflecting strong operating results and significant capital gains under the accounting policy where equity valuations are reflected in net income. Adjusted net income was $776 million or $2.30 per diluted share in the first quarter. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.5%, which is a broader measure of how we do from an overall return standpoint than just the underlying combined ratio.","Let's turn to slide four. We had a good start on 2019's operating priorities. The first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base, are intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as the enterprise net promoter score improved and customer retention increased across our three underwriting brands.","Returns remained strong, both in total and for our individual businesses, as Jess will discuss. The Allstate and Esurance brands grew policies in force by 2.3% and 10.9% respectively, which resulted in the Property-Liability policies increasing by $833,000 compared to the prior year quarter. When you combine that then with the significant growth at SquareTrade, total policies in force now exceed $123 million. The $84 billion investment portfolio total return was 4.7% for the last 12 months.","Net investment income for the quarter was adversely affected by lower performance-based results reflecting lower private equity asset valuations. The performance-based portfolio did generate $57 million of capital gains this quarter. We continue to make progress building long-term growth platforms, expanding our relationship with a transportation network to 15 states. We are growing telematics usage and SquareTrade is adding capabilities and expanding markets, while achieving its acquisition goals.","Mario will now go through the segment results in more detail.","Mario Rizzo","Thanks Tom. Moving to slide five. You can see that Property-Liability results remained strong. Net written premium increased 6.2% in the first quarter, due to policy growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands and a higher average premium across all three underwritten brands. As you can see in the bottom left table, total policies in force increased to $33.4 million or 2.6%. The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 91.8% was 4.3 points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates was 84.2% for the first quarter of 2019.","In the quarter, we changed to a fair value based accounting method for pension and other post retirement benefits. This change benefited the underlying combined ratio by approximately 0.2 points in the first quarter relative to the prior method. Our full year outlook for the underlying combined ratio in 2019 was established at the beginning of the year at 86% to 88%, but we do not adjust the range based on one quarter of results.","Moving to the right hand table. Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance net written premiums decreased by 4.7% and 6.8% respectively due to policy growth and higher average premiums. Higher average premiums reflect rate changes of over 3.7% in homeowners and 1.4% in auto insurance over the last 12 months. Esurance's auto insurance rate changes were 2.3% over the last 12 months, which combined with policy growth, grew total net written premium growth of 13.4%. Encompass written premiums are essentially flat as higher rates were offset by lower policies in force. On the bottom of the table, you can see the underlying combined ratios were all good in the quarter.","Moving to slide six. Our services businesses are growing rapidly and creating shareholder value. SquareTrade revenues increased 34% to $164 million in the first quarter of 2019 driven by significant growth in policies in force. Adjusted net income was $11 million, an increase [indiscernible] from the prior year quarter due to $14 million of profits at SquareTrade as you can see on the right. Arity continued to invest in advancing our telematics platform and had a small loss. Total mileage analyzed is now about 10 billion miles per month and 350% trips per se. Allstate roadside services revenue was $73 million for the quarter with an adjusted net loss of $6 million comparable to the prior year quarter, Allstate dealer services revenue was $107 million in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $6 million, benefiting from improved loss experience. InfoArmor, which was acquired in October 2018, had revenues of $24 million with over 1.2 million policies in force. The adjusted net loss of $1 million was due to costs associated with the scaling of platform for growth and integration into Allstate. We also acquired iCracked in February which will expand SquareTrade's protection offerings.","Turning to slide seven, let's review Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $73 million in the first quarter, up 2.8% from the prior year quarter as higher premiums and investment income more than offset decreased contract benefits and expense. Allstate benefits adjusted net income, shown in the middle chart, was $31 million in the first quarter. The $2 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by lower contract benefits. Allstate annuities, on the right, had an adjusted net loss of $25 million in the quarter due to lower performance lower performance-based investment income. While the utilization of performance-based investments improved long term economic returns, it increases income volatility for the annuities segment.","Let's move to slide eight and discuss our investment results. We proactively manage the investment portfolio considering relevant market conditions, the nature of our liabilities and corporate risk appetite. Our investment portfolio generated a strong 4.7% total return over the last 12 months, of which 3.3% was in the first quarter. The components of return are shown in the chart on the left.","The blue bar represents net investment income, which is included in adjusted net income and varies between 80 and 110 basis points per quarter. Approximately 75% of this is from interest income on fixed income investments, which make up 69% of the portfolio. The change in the value of bond portfolio and equity investment obviously varies by quarter, which is why we discuss total return over a 12-month period. Valuation changes in the quarter benefited from declines in risk free rates, tighter credit spreads and a strong rebound of public equity margins.","The chart on the right shows net investment income for the first quarter was $648 million, $138 million lower than the first quarter of 2018. Market-based investment income increased to $693 million from $652 million reflecting a modest duration extension for the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a reduced allocation to high yield bonds. The performance-based portfolio generated investment income of $6 million in the first quarter, lower than the prior year and recent trend reflecting lower private equity asset valuations. The performance-based portfolio did generate $57 million of capital gains as the ownership structure of certain investments requires we record capital gain rather than investment income.","Slide nine provides an overview of returns and capital. Our capital position remains strong and we paid $158 million in common shareholder dividends in the first quarter of 2019. As reminder, the Board of Directors approved an 8.7% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.50, which was paid on April 1 and is not included in the amount returned in the first quarter. Common shares are being purchased with $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, which began in December 2018 and will be completed this week. Upon completion of this agreement, we will have about $1.9 billion remaining on our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Total shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were 6% below the prior year. So each shareholder owns 6% more of the company. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital with adjusted net income return on equity of 13.5% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2019.","And now Jess will provide an overview of how we economically evaluate risk and return.","Jess Merten","Thank you Mario. Let's turn on slide 10 which shows how Allstate uses sophisticated analytics and economic valuation to allocate capital and establish performance goals. Our approach to capital allocation considers multiple perspectives while allowing us to focus on optimizing returns per unit of risk. This begins with establishing economic capital requirements for individual risk by products such as auto, home or life insurance, investment risk such as interest rates or equity valuations by business and for the entire corporation.","Capital requirements are based on cash flow projections and probabilistic models, especially for extreme events like catastrophes and incorporate expectations from regulators and rating agencies. This approach allows us to evaluate risk at a granular level to enable us to optimize economic results. Our diversified portfolio of businesses results in a capital benefit that we also incorporate into our strategic capital allocation process. We retain the benefit of risk forbearance between market facing businesses at the corporate level so that each business runs an appropriate standalone return.","As a result of these processes, Allstate's capital position is strong and performance exceeds return thresholds. About three-fourth of capital is utilized by the Property-Liability business. All major businesses earned return above the cost of capital other than annuities. We dynamically allocate capital based on risk and return characteristics to establish performance targets. I will start with two examples, Esurance and homeowners insurance to show the benefits of this approach. Let me walk through these point in more detail.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our process for determining economic capital. Economic capital is the amount of capital needed to accept risks given expected returns and the range of possible outcomes. This is determined using a sophisticated framework built on our experience and data related to individual risks. In the middle of the slide, you can see the four step process to determine economic capital.","Step one is to identify unique risk and return equity for different types of standalone risks. You start with hundreds of individual risks that are grouped into 35 standalone risk types. Examples include auto insurance underwriting risk or interest rate risk.","From there we determine required capital for each lines of business by aligning asset and liability risk and estimated correlation to key risks. For example, in establishing capital for auto insurance, accident frequency is uncorrelated with investment risk associated with reserves. So this includes the economic capital.","In step three, we aggregate the risk by product and lines of business that comprise of each market-facing operation such as Allstate brand's personal lines Esurance or Allstate auto. The programs between risk types is retained by the market-facing businesses, so required capital [indiscernible] integrated risk profile.","The final step, which is [indiscernible] risk group in step three is to quantify the capital required for the entire corporation with a diversified portfolio of risk.","This four step process results in overall economic capital being less in each market-facing business as diversification between non-correlated risk lowers Allstate's overall risk level. This program is retained by the corporation so that each business must earn an appropriate return for its risk profile. In setting the value of the capital target, we also consider regulatory and rating agency guidelines and overall financial flexibility.","Turning to slide 12. Required capital by line is shown on the upper left quadrant. Approximately one-third of the economic capital is used by auto insurance. About 40% is needed for homeowners insurance which is heavily influenced by catastrophe exposure. These economic capital, industry performance and strategic intent sets out the performance target for our business. Actual results are then used to evaluate performance from a growth and returns perspective as shown on the upper right.","First, you can see all major market-facing businesses are earning returns above our cost of capital on a standalone basis except Annuities. The highest return business is Allstate brand auto insurance. SquareTrade has higher returns and growth, but because of it's relative size and modest risk profile, it generates less absolute income than Allstate businesses.","Moving to the bottom of the page. Esurance provides a good example of how we use this to evaluate performance in comparison to reported results. Esurance has a combined ratio over 100 but generates a return on capital above our targets. As a result, we invested aggressively in growth.","On the lower left, you can see Esurance's combined ratio has [indiscernible]. A large part of the combined ratio however is advertising which is immediately expensed that generates policy which makes million for years. When we acquired Esurance in 2011, we decided to invest aggressively in advertising, which has totaled about $1.3 billion and all have been expensed immediately. This has worked as Esurance now has $2 billion of premium and is in more than twice its original size. To ensure this is economic, we established performance targets for each [indiscernible].","The combined ratios start out high, as you can see on the lower right chart to reflect both the new business policy and the significant advertising cost. The combined ratio of each business year however then declines dramatically since there are no advertising expenses and pricing changes were implemented. This combined ratio is lower and this generates cash which then combined with investment income results in return theme above our targets [indiscernible].","Slide 13 shows homeowners insurance as an example of how economic capital supports the process to establish performance goal within market-facing businesses. As with on the previous slide, over half of the required capital for homeowners was due to catastrophe exposure.","We allocate this by state, as shown in the upper left side pie chart. Texas, shown in blue, has significantly slowed due to hurricanes, hailstorms and tornadoes. So the homeowners business must generate returns on the capital needed for these risks. New York, shown in dark red, also had substantial risk, potential risk of hurricane while the probability of loss is low in intensity, the concentration of high value homes on Long Island and Allstate' significant market share results in a large absolute amount of capital required to cover this risk. Notably Florida, shown in orange on the lower right of this chart, is small in absolute dollars because of our extensive use of reinsurance and market share that is below 2%.","We use this analysis to establish combined ratio targets which vary by states and as you can see from the top right chart, targets differ between high capital and lower capital states. Our top five states utilized 45% of Allstate brand homeowners insurance economic capital, with an average combined ratio target of 83%. This compares to the remaining 45 states which utilize 55% of economic capital at an average combined ratio target of 88%.","This approach ensures we achieve strong aggregate returns with the economic hurdles that reflects the underlying risk of each states. The adjusted target of the cash to the exposures change and in total, this has declined over the last decade, which we can see from the bottom left chart. In establishing targets, we also compare ourselves to our competitors in wanting to have a competitive price and better performance.","As shown on the chart at the bottom right, we have a better combined ratio than Progressive, Liberty Mutual and State Farm while being competitively priced for the value we deliver and earn attractive returns. These sophisticated capital allocation capabilities are well woven in our strategy, while generating attractive risk adjusted returns on capital.","Now, we will open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much. On personal auto, in particularly the Allstate brand, we are hearing a little bit more about increased competition on rates. I was wondering, if you could touch base on that in terms of what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint and also how Allstate is addressing that issue too? Thanks.","Glenn Shapiro","Hi Jay. Thank you. This is Glenn. Yes. We are seeing definitely competition out there. If you look at the CPI a year ago, it was at 9%. Now it's in the twos. That said, we like our competitive position. It's something we monitor in each state on an ongoing basis about how we are doing both competitively and from a return standpoint. Our new business is up. Our retention is up. And I think the most encouraging sign is that the system is helping in that, we have got about 3,000 more people in that system selling our product than we did a year ago. That means agents are investing and hiring more sales people and they are smart, small business owners and they only do that when they feel like they can compete. So it's a competitive market out there. I know you have heard that from others in the market and you can see the rates are getting filed, but we like our position and our ability to grow.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. And then, within the Allstate brand, on the so-called commercial lines business, can you talk a little bit about exactly what that is and what's driving the fast growth?","Steven Shebik","So Jay, this is Steve. So at commercial lines, we generally focus on smaller businesses. That's been our historic business for a long time. So a lot of our policyholders also own businesses. We are out in the marketplace within 10,000 communities in the United States. I would say most communities. So we have a presence. And we want to ensure not only autos and homes, but other things in their lives, as Tom noted at the beginning in terms of broadening of protection. If you remember, back last March, so March of 2018, we signed an agreement with Uber to insure some of their drivers. So we had three states originally. Then we added a fourth in June. And just March, we initially added 11 more states. So the growth you have seen over the last year-and-a-half, about a year in the quarter, is really based on that Uber relationship.","Jay Gelb","I see. Can you characterize the -- you would generally characterize the profitability of that line?","Steven Shebik","If you look at our balance, we say it's early for us to really analyze how we are doing in that. We are recording at our priced loss ratios. We feel we are pretty good with those. But the history is not really there. More than half of the potential claims from the T&C's would be in liability coverages. So it's longer tail on those. And as you know, these businesses have not been in business for more than a handful of years of any size. And so as we see the market changing and those companies growing rapidly, you need to be careful and conservative in your reserving and pricing.","Mario Rizzo","So, Jay and let me provide a little perspective. So when we first set up the relationship with Uber, of course, they were doing a bunch of this themselves and they are using some other people. We had access to all that data. One of the reasons we are a value to them as a partner is our claims capabilities. And so we can look in quite fair amount of detail at how to handle those bodily injury claims. So we are confident that we are in a good place.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please?","Greg Peters","Good morning. My first question. I guess I am going to focus on the last piece of your presentation around capital allocation. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the balance between maximizing ROEs and investing in the business? In your chart, specifically the one on the upper right hand corner of page 12 where you identify Arity, the annuities business and roadside services as running below your cost of capital hurdles. And I suppose this is in the context of the published reports of the possibility of the sale of your annuity business.","Tom Wilson","Okay. Let me take it and then, Jess, if you want to jump on the annuity piece. So first, Greg, we run the business for the long term. We try not to run it for quarterly earnings. So in 2011, in the bottom of the crisis for us, we were still investing heavily in advertising. So we always try to look long-term at whatever we are investing in. It doesn't mean we keep throwing money, good money after bad. We do watch our expenses quite closely. So we tried to take a longer term view of that.","That also applies to annuities and it applies to Arity. Let me do Arity first then annuity second. So Arity, one of the things Jess said is that's a standalone number. And so Arity, but if you look at Arity in terms of the whole company, the amount of value it's creating for us in our insurance businesses in terms of better pricing, it's a net win for us. So we evaluate them independently but then we look collectively at how they work with our company.","The same thing is true with annuities. So at annuities, we have talked about multiple times, right. Annuities are not a good business for us from a return standpoint on two basis. One is economically and two is in the financial book. If you look at the economic piece of that, that's because these are long-dated liabilities. Long-dated liabilities like the pension fund should be mostly invested in equities and the regulatory capital requirement for investing in equities is quite high.","So you should be investing equities but when you put all that money in equity, but it doesn't bring your current return down even though on a long-term basis, it's absolutely the right thing to do. We chose to do that anyway. And what we do is, we allocate a portion of that corporate co-variance in our own model. We can still manage overall corporate results, but we just allocate a portion of that corporate co-variance which is obviously a capital reduction to that business.","Financially, it's also not a good return business for us and that's because the way the reserving has been done and required for years has been, when you set up the reserves, initially you don't change it. And there's a few odd cases that work, but generally you don't change, when people live longer, because these are the payout annuities, you don't change your reserves and when interest rates go down, you don't change in reserves.","And so as a result of that there is a liability that is bigger, if you look at it from an economic standpoint. We factor that into adjusted numbers just has it all factored into how we look at the company. It just doesn't show up on the financial book. So there is some new accounting things coming out, which Eric talked about both in the K in the Q that will change their accounting.","And what that changed accounting will do is basically take those losses that have been incurred economically in the past that we factored into our analysis into the balance sheet. And well, that will be a material change to the balance sheet. So we always though managed long term, think economically, cash flow is what drives us, but we are cognizant of what's going on in the financial results and try to help you see when those numbers are at odd.","Is that helpful?","Greg Peters","Yes, it is. Just a point on and I have a second question, but a point on your annuity comment. The material charge or the material event as it relates to annuities, that's expected to happen in the fourth quarter 2020 or 2021?","Tom Wilson","It's required to be adopted in 2021. But as like always the case in these things, you can choose to do it once you figure it out. But it's complicated.","Greg Peters","Okay. My second question and thank you for that answer. My second question, switching gears to homeowners. The Allstate brand homeowners underlying combined ratio still feels like it's running a little bit higher or a little bit above target and the Encompass homeowners underlying combined ratio is even higher than that. And I am just curious about your perspective about the homeowners business. Do you feel like that's a market where there's more rate in the pipeline? Are you satisfied with the returns and the growth profile?","Tom Wilson","Let me start up top and then Glenn and Steve might want to make some comments for Allstate brand and then Encompass. So first, we love the homeowners business. We get really good returns in it and we help customers because it is something that with these level of catastrophes is really important today. And so when you look at the, you are talking about the underlying combined ratio, I think, four or five years ago we started talking about it should be in the low-60s. I think it's about 63 right now.","That doesn't factor in the fact that the catastrophe losses have come down over that period of time as well. So we don't talk to it. We don't share our specific targets by line, by state with people and probably because it is just too complicated a conversation to have over time. But we feel really good about our overall returns in homeowners.","I do think that the Encompass returns are not as good as they need to be. And Steve will talk about what he is going to do that. That said, we manage our business at a granular level and everybody doesn't get an A on every test. We don't, like, throw them out of the class, right. So some states are good. And then we have to work to get them back. Some brands are not as good on something and we work to get them back in place. And Glenn can talk about what he's doing in profitability in the first and the Allstate brand because again we don't sit still on edge even though we have good returns. We have work to do.","And Steve can talk about Encompass.","Steven Shebik","All right. Yes. So I always say, the first number I look at just for context, I look at the recorded combined and then the underlying because if you really think about this business, we are accountable to manage the catastrophe risk too. So over the long period of time, you really want to produce an underwriting profit. And over the last seven years, I think there's only been one quarter that we didn't produce an underwriting profit. So it's been a good stable business. To building on Tom's point, we like homeowner and we like the return we are getting overall with homeowner, the 92 in the quarter.","But your question is right in that the underlying has ticked up over time, particularly look at the last five quarters or so. And last quarter I said to you that we had last year a very wet year. A lot of non-cat weather. So more rain, less hail was my line. I think I regret that line now. Actually, a lot hail in the first quarter. And so you look at the weather patterns and it is something we have to respond to. We did take a couple of points of rate in the first quarter.","And the other thing I would point you to is, we do have an inflationary factor built into home. So sometimes we are not only focused on a filed rate and if you look at the trailing 12-months, it's 3.2. But the average premium is up 4.5 because of the inflationary factor. So if you take that 2.1 in the first quarter and about three points in the last two quarters and look at inflationary factors on there too, we are responding and reacting to new weather patterns.","Glenn Shapiro","So when you look at Encompass, Tom said it very well. We believe we need to take some actions in order to raise the returns and lower the combined ratio we have in the business. We do have a little bit different footprint than what the Allstate brand has and we are more concentrated. Obviously, it's a much smaller book of business. There are areas where we point agents and they have had a lot of business. We don't have the same broad footprint that the Allstate brand has.","So that leaves in places where we have switched certain concentrations in areas that sometimes they have significant catastrophe exposures and sometimes we have no exposure in areas. So California wildfires, we had areas where we had significant losses. You may have seen a year before last. In other areas we had none. So the things we are working on to improve the business, there are a number of states we need to have significant rate increases. And we are working hard to achieve those to get those particular locations up to our cost of capital and above.","Secondly, we are looking at our footprint. I am trying to reduce that concentration. So in some areas, we are appointing agents away from the areas we are. In other, we are trying to constrain business through underwriting in areas where we are too highly concentrated.","And lastly, we are working on our processes, claims, pricing sophistication so we can create a bit closer and better for the risk that we have. So we hope over time that we will get a very similar result as Allstate brand has. That's out goal.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Thanks. My first question, I am going back to the auto environment a little bit more. Your new business growth, which you did highlight in response to an earlier question, did slow year-over-year this quarter. I know it obviously last year was a pretty good new business growth here for your auto book. Was that expected? Or are you seeing kind of any change out there as some other peers are also now taking less rate and also looking to grow?","Tom Wilson","Thanks Elyse. Yes, there's no question that, as I mentioned before, that the CPI is down and for context, when you look at the CPI at about 2.4 in the first quarter, that's a trailing 12-months basically because it's the rate that as people open their build that month, what kind of surprises they are getting. And obviously this year, at 2.4% increase on average versus a 9% the prior year does create less shoppers. That said, I think you put it in your question well that this is an increase over what was a high base. We had a strong year last year and a strong first quarter last year on new business and we are increasing over that in that sort of the health of the system overall.","Jess Merten","Elyse, I would add and Glenn said this earlier, we are also focused on retention. So our retention was up half a point. That's half a point of growth and that's half a point of growth of new business penalty associated with it. So one of the things we obviously want to focus on, one of the reasons are one of our operating priorities, better serve our customers is because it is good for them and good for us. So the other part is, I think a lot of people focus on this. The percentage changes that are out there, that is important. The other part is, what's your absolute price. So while some people have reduced their price recently, we still think we have a highly competitive price relative to them. So they are just coming down closer to where we are as opposed to taking us out of the market.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys filed, you provided your updated catastrophe reinsurance program last night as well. It seems like your nationwide cover you have, the tower goes a little bit higher compared to where it was last year, greater cat bond usage in the program and it seems like your cost only modestly went up. I wasn't sure if you could just talk to us a little bit about placing the cover and what you saw in terms of the market and the price there? And then as you think of placing in the Florida portion of your coverage, is there anything that would indicate that maybe what you are seeing in the pricing there would be different than when you placed that nationwide cover?","Mario Rizzo","This is Mario. I will answer your question on reinsurance. So I will take you back to what Jess talked about in the presentation around how we think about risk return on capital. As reinsurance is one of the ways that we kind of optimize the risk and return profile of our homeowners business and we use reinsurance extensively. And we posted the details around our national excess of loss cat program yesterday and we did increase the top of our tower a bit. So we bought coverage up to $4.86 billion after a $500 million retention on a per event cover.","In addition to that, we repeated in the catastrophe bond market what we started last year, which was, we replaced a cat bond that provides both excessive loss cover as well as serves as an aggregate. So we now have roughly $800 million of aggregate protection in excess of $3.54 billion. So we have both an excess of loss program as well as an aggregate program through two catastrophe bonds.","I think from a pricing standpoint, your comment was spot on. We did see some modest pressure on pricing. I think a lot of that was driven by reinsurers kind of reevaluating their wildfire exposure in their models. But it was not a material move from a pricing standpoint. So we feel really good about the placement this year.","And then just to remind you, we effectively renew a third of our program every year which further insulates us from any real fluctuations in reinsurance pricing year-to-year. So we feel good about the execution and we use both the traditional reinsurance market and the ILS market to have optimized the execution of our placements. So overall, we feel good about the program.","With Florida, obviously, there have been a lot of a stories around the upward development on some of the hurricane losses. Our recoveries over the last couple of years have been a bit more modest, I think, than others. So we will see what the ultimate pricing is, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful variation relative to what we saw in the national program.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions. The first question uses page 21 of your supplement as a backdrop. If you look at the loss cost trends, severity is up 6%, frequency is usually down in the 1% to 3% range. How should we think about, I guess, that trend line versus the written premiums for the next few quarters?","Jess Merten","Amit, let me provide an overview of how we establish financials and then Glenn can talk about the specific operations. So we give paid numbers and we have both, we have gross net paid incurred case reserves. We slice and dice our work on what is the right loss cost to put in the financials at some great length. And so we feel comfortable with the reserves. We have established based on the trends that you see in paid and then the other trends we see in the other numbers.","Glenn, I know we have talked at some length about on physical damage in auto insurance. I assume that's where you are at. And Glenn can talk about that component.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes. So physical damage, as you point out, has been elevated really over the last year and you see things across the industry and we are no exception to it. It's run around 6% and is for the quarter as well versus the longer term trend of around 4%. One thing, I think is important for sort of context in the broader question you have around that relative to margins and to prices is that, that's really sort of one quarter of the overall auto loss trends. Because if you break it out, physical damage coverages and injury coverages, that splits roughly half-and-half. And each of those are impacted equally by frequency and severity, as you point out. It's really when you look at overall loss trends, three out of the four quadrants that I just described are performing at or better than expectations and one is running higher.","So the overall loss trend is manageable right now and you could see that in our combined ratio and the fact that rates have been relatively modest. But we are clearly focused on the physical damage and just a little color behind that, I know we talked about it last quarter is, you look at the math and auto manufacturers have definitely increased the pricing of parts. You look at the trajectory and some of this is complexity of cars and some of it is pricing choices because you look at the overall cost of cars and how it's accelerated over 10 years to buy a car in whole and the cost of parts and the two trend lines are wildly different. The cost of parts have gone up dramatically faster than the cost of a car and that's definitely impacting repair costs, which then create more total losses and higher fiscal damage expenses.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's very helpful. The only other question is and this might be an easy answer here. I was looking at the expense ratio for Allstate brand homeowners and auto. And there seems to be some sort of variability in Q1. The Q1 number seem to be down versus Q2, Q3 and Q4. How should I think about that? What exactly is causing that expense ratio to be slightly down in Q1 versus the remaining three quarters?","Tom Wilson","Amit, I wouldn't really look at the expense ratio by quarter and draw a trend line from one quarter to next because there's stuff that goes in and out every quarter. We make adjustment, agency bonus and these all kinds of different accruals. So I would note that. Glenn can talk about the work we are doing on expenses, which is in an environment where you are running, let's just take home auto at 90 combined ratio, homeowners at 92 and a regulated environment on price and some even modest cost pressure, you want to maintain your margins as well as you can. So you look at all things you can do to control those margins including expenses.","So Glenn might want to talk some about what we are doing at expense management.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes. We have been very focused on expenses. As Tom said, when you look at where we are and what levers you can pull and I think the greatest value we can provide customers is to deliver the product with lower expense. So we looked at our supplier management. We have a lot of really good work going on with our procurement. From an operational standpoint, in our claims area, the team has moved materially on their expenses over the last year-plus, they are down 500-plus people in terms of the overall operation and being able to manage in spite of our growth and the frequency trend creating kind of a flat claims reported trend. And we are looking at, as we go forward, we are looking at ways that we can manage expenses more effectively with our agency force as well through things like providing services to our agency force. So expenses are a significant focus for us.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Thanks for that clarification and good luck for the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Good morning. So my first question is around the increased use of telematics. So, I think we all intuitively understand that it should also result in some improvement in the loss ratio over time. But can you maybe talk a little bit about whether you see an impact from greater use of telematics on the expense ratio, whether through more efficient claims handling or more efficient customer acquisition?","Tom Wilson","Yes. Let me go up a minute and then, Don can talk about some of the things we are doing at telematics. Glenn, may be you can talk about claims. So well, I would rephrase your question a little bit, if you give me the space to say, it's really about integrated digital enterprise. So it's using data, analytics, technology and process redesign to improve our effectiveness and our efficiency. So we have talked at some length about quick photo claims. So six pictures from customers, pay them in hours, not in days, no more 937 drive-throughs, fewer auto adjusters. So there's is a variety of work we are doing around the company to build an integrated digital enterprise.","One part of that is telematics. And that's getting information, accumulating information. I don't think that that's reduced our expenses. In fact, we have been investing heavily in telematics for the last nine or 10 years. And each year we invest more because we see it adding more value to our customers.","And Don can talk about the overall view of why we are doing telematics and the benefits to our customers and our company.","But maybe, Glen do you want to start with IDE and then Don with telematics.","Glenn Shapiro","Sure. Yes. So we really think there is a lot of opportunity going forward with telematics as you think about operational improvement. So for one and this is a go forward, this is not in place today but you look at the opportunity to report losses in real time. So eliminating the need for first notice a lot because we have instantaneous notification. And then opportunity is there in the, I will call it, relative near term, is not a far out proposition. And then we are already working with looking at information for liability determination. It's helping us understand what occurs in an accident, which can make you both more efficient and more accurate in what you are doing.","But one other piece that I don't think was in the question, but I think it's really important is, we have a materially higher promoter score when people are using telematics. So you think about retention and you think about the interest that people have and the feedback they are getting to become better drivers and just the interesting thing with Allstate, it makes a big difference when we have those signed up with telematics.","Don Civgin","Yes. So let me talk a little bit about the early side of it. So we talked last month about the value of telematics and how it can be used in different ways. And I think two conclusions from that. The first is, we firmly believe that it will be the better way to price insurance because we have a better understanding of risk. I think the second thing is the access to that telematics data also allows us to understand driving behavior, which is an important component of adding value back for customers, both our customers and our partners' customers.","So we have been investing in Arity. You mentioned the expense side of it. Arity is running at a very small loss at this point. But a large part of that is not just investment in things that we know how to do today, but it's product development as well. So we are investing in things that will create more value in the future for our customers. And that's probably roughly half of the investment we are making on the product side.","We have just under 15 million connections with customers today. I think we talked a little bit about how much data we are collecting, how quickly we are analyzing that. We have analyzed roughly 115 billion miles and what that allows us to do is, again, not only price the insurance more accurately but provide value for our customers. So if you look at our relationship with Life360, through that connection we are able not only to give them safe driving tips for their customers, but also get them personalized insurance offers from a variety of different carriers. So it is an investment. It offers lots of opportunities in the future around pricing and the ability to serve customers that will make them safer drivers.","Yaron Kinar","Pretty well. Thank you for the comprehensive answer. I guess one other very quick one. Why was the reclassification of the pensions, why did it impact the loss ratio as opposed to the expense ratio?","Tom Wilson","Yes. That's the thing about the part of the loss ratio as claim expense, which is related to the people that settle claims for us. So that part of the pension expense goes through the loss ratio.","Yaron Kinar","So this pension expense only impacted that claims people as opposed to --?","Tom Wilson","No. It gets allocated across both claims and underwriting expense. So the fact that there is people embedded within our claim expense ratio that's where that the loss ratio benefits from that change?","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. You might have your phone on mute. There we go.","Michael Phillips","Hello there? Can you hear me?","Operator","We can hear you now.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Thank you. So a question kind of stepping back at a high level. So we measure a lot of things. I guess I am curious if you measure foot traffic in and out of your brick and mortar stores that are out throughout the country, so kind of the number of people coming in and out of those stores. And if you do, how has that changed today versus if you look at back maybe 10 years ago? Are more people coming into using that or less?","Tom Wilson","This is Tom. I can't give you number 10 years versus today. And I would say, that you have to split that into two components. What do they come in for that they want to come in for? And what do they come in for because you make them come in for it?","And so, for example, if you have a bill that's late and you can make somebody come in and drop it off at your office or you can give them a credit card option and then they can call and put it on the credit card, not have to drive anywhere. So in general, our focus is to be there for our customers when they want us to be there for them and to use faster, more digital technologies when they don't want it.","I do think what you are saying is the trend over 10 years, a lot more people are comfortable using digital stuff. The capabilities are better. The phones are better. And so we are leaning in heavily to that whereas we used to make people come to our drive-through claim places to get their car looked at. We now have them send us six pictures.","So that said, there are plenty of things that people do want to come into the office. But it depends on the office and the type of customers. So we try to be there for them when those people want to be there. So some agencies hold events for their customers. They hold their charity events there or they do planning processes or they go out, they don't go over to the office, but the agency goes to the school and talks about distracted driving. So I would say, in general, our effort though is to try to do as much as we can digitally that the customer wants to do digitally so that it lowers our cost and improves our speed and to the extent they want to do it in person, then we do it in person.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Thank you Tom. I will let others get in given the lack of time. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Michael Zaremski","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. In regards to the pension accounting changes, can you clarify how that helped underlying combined ratio? And does it change how we should think about the guidance range as well?","Tom Wilson","I will let Mario answer how it went through the combined ratio and the guidance. But I would only add just on the guidance. We knew we were making this change when we did the guidance. The reason we made this change really is the trend towards financial reporting is fair value, whether that's your equity portfolio goes up or down in a quarter, goes to net income that used to be unrealized capital gains and didn't go through net income. And so this is just another step along the way going to sort of fair value on the overall result.","Now in addition, it was kind of choppy the way it was before with pension settlement charges and this just spreads it out over a longer or spreads it out over time. You don't get these quarterly bumps or settlement charges when people decide they want to retire, which tends to be at the end of a year. So you are kind of dancing around in the fourth quarter is where they have a settlement charges. This just puts it all on fair value, puts us all on the same basis.","Mario, do you want to talk about the combined ratio?","Mario Rizzo","Yes. Maybe I will just give you a little bit of color on, really when you think about pension expense I would break it out into two pieces. So the part Tom alluded to the fair value component which is really just the change in the valuation of planned assets and liabilities quarter-to-quarter, that runs through the income statement through net income, but it gets reported below the line. So it doesn't affect adjusted net income.","The portion of pension expense that is in adjusted net income is really the period specific pension costs. Things like benefit accruals for that particular period, interest cost, those kinds of things. Those are still in adjusted net income. When you look at the differences, as I mentioned during the presentation, when you look at the difference between kind of the previous method and the current method of pension accounting for the first quarter of 2019 and we provide you a table in the 10-Q that gives you the difference in cost, in whole for the corporation it was worth about $21 million in lower cost in the quarter. Not all of that is Property-Liability, a portion of it is. That's where you get to about the two-tenths of a point impact in the quarter.","So I would view that as a reasonably small impact. And to Tom's point, we knew we were going to make the change when we established the guidance. So I don't think it really has an impact on how we think about the outlook for the combined ratio.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. That's very helpful. And my last question is regarding slide 13. You show your net PMLs have been reduced a lot over time. And so directionally, should your catastrophe load also be lower than your, let's just say, 13 or 14-year long term historical average? And Tom, I believe you touched on this potentially earlier in your answer about homeowners returns?","Tom Wilson","Well, I think, what it does do is, it lowers the amount of capital you carry for catastrophe events. But mathematically the probable maximum loss is really driven by large individual discrete events like, of course for hurricane or some large set of events, which are low probability. That's where you are carrying all that capital for just in case something really bad happens.","When you look at the catastrophe load on a quarterly basis and say how many hailstorms do we have? How many freezes do we have? That's really driven more by the weather. And that's factored into, that doesn't reduce capital as much because those things tend to go. So I wouldn't automatically go from lower PML to go to that chart we have in the supplement that shows percentage of premiums on cap and say that should be coming down too because what really drives that is just the weather.","Now we do a bunch of things around it to make sure it's less, right. So we have house and home, we do age rate groups. We do a whole bunch of things to manage that number, as Glenn said, because we are accountable for the total combined ratio. But I wouldn't translate lower PML, lower capital therefore lower percentage every quarter.","Michael Zaremski","So then if I could follow-up then. So from us looking from the outside in, should we just use your very long-term historical cat load as a guide mirror for making our projections? Thanks.","Tom Wilson","Yes. I would look at the long term percentage and just say that cats not predictable. And so I would come back to, on a rolling basis, as Glenn said, we have made money every quarter for seven years, except for one. I think, like in homeowners, you just kind of look at it on a longer-term basis. Just a one-year, three-year basis, you want to run a combined ratio where you are getting a fair amount of spread on it. Some of our competitors run combined ratios substantially higher than us in homeowners. We don't think that's appropriate because of the capital that you have to put up and you don't get a lot of investment income at homeowners.","So you should look at us and assume we can have a reported combined ratio that generates an underwriting profit. And just talked showed you what we think those should be and that's by state. Obviously in total, it can be higher than that by state because we have co-variance that's not shown in that chart. So when you see the one that says 88, we could be higher than 88, still get a good return on the whole company, because we have co-variance in it.","Glenn Shapiro","And Jonathon, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Josh Shanker","I just want a quick one following up on Amit's question on auto expense severity a little bit. As more cars hit the road with automatic emergency braking and weird gadgets and the side view mirrors and whatnot. Is the upward trend in severity a permanent part of what we are going to see happen on physical damage for the foreseeable future?","Glenn Shapiro","Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. This is Glenn. I would say that there is no question, the complexity of cars is getting greater and we have seen the increase in cost to repair than that of cost of parts. Now theoretically, you get two sides of that equation that all of those things you just mentioned should help avoid some accidents. We see some evidence of that in some places. But frankly the broader trend of lower frequency is more driven by the number of miles driven than it is by that. But over time you would expect some frequency benefit as the car park increases the percentage of cars that have loss avoidance capabilities and an increase in the cost to repair those cars.","So I do think there is the potential for a long term trend that you would have the cost of the newer cars making up a bigger portion of the overall cost to repair. But it's why I think we need to work with manufacturers and look at the cost of parts, because as I think I said last quarter, the percentage of total losses continues to go up and I don't think it's good for society or the industry as a whole to you have cars become disposable to where if it's in an accident, you throw it out and you get new one. I think there is benefit to be able to come up with more attractive and cost effective ways to repair these cars.","Tom Wilson","Okay. Thank you all. So our strategy is to properly grow market share in our protection products, making sure we have good strong results. We had a good strong quarter. We will continue to work on behalf of our shareholders by innovating and growing market share. Thank you very much. Have a great quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick Macellaro - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for Allstate's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson, Chief Financial Officer Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. The documents are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. As always, I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you have after the call.","And now I'll turn it over to Tom Wilson.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, good morning. We appreciate you taking the time to stay current on Allstate's operating results. This quarter shows really why we're in business, which is to protect people when disaster strikes. Overall operating profit is down largely because of two significant hailstorms in Texas in March. At the same time, good progress was made in improving the underlying combined ratio for auto insurance and the homeowners business continued to generate margins that enable us to handle large catastrophe losses like we saw in March and still generate a good return for shareholders.","So as you know, severe weather creates a need for our customers to be protected. It's an increasing market these days. And Allstate does an excellent job of helping customers when these events happen. In Texas we have over 1,100 local agencies, many of whom are close to our customers that are impacted by these hailstorms so that they can help provide initial claim response. We also have about 1,200 especially trained catastrophe adjusters on the ground in Texas with the expertise, technology and relationships that enable our customers to rebuild after these storms.","If we go to slide two, I'll begin by reviewing the overall results and priorities and then pass to Steve who will discuss the results in greater detail. As always Matt Winter, our President is here as is Don Civgin who leads the emerging businesses and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","Net income for the quarter was $217 million and operating income was $322 million or $0.84 per share. The largest driver of the variance from last year's first quarter was catastrophe losses which increased by $533 million to $827 million. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 as the auto profitability actions we've put into place for Allstate Esurance and Encompass all made progress in the first quarter from where we ended 2015.","Allstate brand homeowners insurance had a recorded combined ratio of 93.4 for the quarter despite the significant catastrophe losses. The recorded combined ratio was 82.3 for the last 12 months.","From an investment perspective, we had what felt like a whole year of volatility in the first three months of the year and ended up with a 2% total return on the portfolio reflecting three components: interest income for the fixed income portfolio, good returns from performance-based investments, and the decline in interest rates over the three-month period. Total return over the last 12 months was only 1.3%, which reflected the low returns in the fixed income investments in the last three quarters of 2015 given the general up trend in interest rates.","Net investment income declined 14% as a result of our strategy to create additional shareholder value by increasing performance-based investments where risk-adjusted returns are higher but reported accounting income fluctuates in the short-term. Two-thirds of the decline in investment income reflects the performance-based annualized yield of 9.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus an outstanding 17.5% in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the underlying strength of Allstate's businesses, the board authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which is in addition to the 10% dividend increase that was approved in February.","We also made progress on the five operating priorities established for 2016. Customers of course are at the heart of our strategy and better serving them will create additional growth and profit. Our internal measures of overall customer satisfaction did deteriorate slightly as we raised auto insurance prices to reflect the increasing number and cost of auto accidents.","That said, we made progress in some of the underlying drivers through expansion of continuous improvement programs and good expense control. Overall, economic returns on capital improved as the auto profitability plan progresses, homeowners stay strong and we position the investment portfolios to align with our liability structure.","While not the same as economic capital, the operating return on book equity was 10% for the last 12 months and it was 8% on a net income basis. Growing the number of customer relationships also faces headwinds as we adapt to the increasing cost of providing auto insurance. Property liability items in force were comparable to a year ago but were down from where we ended 2015.","We did have great growth through Allstate Benefits' work site business, which added over 0.5 million policies over the last 12 months. Steve will discuss how we proactively manage the investment portfolio, but progress was also made in expanding the telematics insurance offering both in terms of customer offering and the number of customers. At over 1 million active connections, we're amongst the leaders in the connected car space.","Let's go to slide three, which provides an overview of the first quarter operating results for our four property-liability customer segments. Starting at the top, overall property-liability policies in force were comparable to a year ago as a result of implementing auto profit improvement plans in all three underwritten brands. Net written premiums still increased, however, as we raised average prices. The recorded combined ratio was 98.4 and the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2. We have not changed our full-year guidance for the underlying combined ratio from 88 to 90.","Moving to the lower left for the Allstate brand, this is our largest segment comprising 90% of premiums written and it serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand's total policies in force growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% as from the prior year's quarter as a result of our targeted actions to improve underlying auto profitability.","Auto policies in force grew by 0.5% from the prior-year quarter, impacted by the slowdown in new business and a decline in retention. Auto written premium growth was 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the positive average premium growth of 4.8%, and that's as the impact of the rate increases continues to flow into results. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year by 0.6% and other personal lines grew by 1.8%, both slowing sequentially given the impact that auto actions have had on customers who prefer to bundle their insurance product.","The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio was a strong 86.1 for the first quarter, as shown in the highlighted red box at the bottom. Esurance on the lower right serves customers that prefer branded products but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. A 1% decline in policies in force was more than offset by a 5.2% increase in average auto premium so that the net written premium increased by 2.5%.","As you know, we intentionally slowed the growth of Esurance last year to better position this business for long-term growth since it was almost double the size it was when we acquired it in 2011. The underlying loss ratio has come down to 73.1 in the first quarter of 2016, which has improved by 5.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 105, which includes about 3.4 points of expenses related to a number of expansion efforts. We do expect to launch a new advertising campaign for Esurance this year to accelerate growth. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about the choice of insurance company and they mostly purchase through independent agencies.","We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance in 2015 and consequently policies in force declined by 9.6% from a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 88.3 for the first quarter, 2.3 points better than the prior year but, as you can see, the recorded combined ratio was 105.8 and that's because Encompass' performance was also significantly impacted by catastrophe losses in the quarter.","Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral customers who are comfortable serving themselves and it increased non-proprietary written premiums by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 to $151 million.","Pat will now go through the property liability results in more detail.","Patrick Macellaro - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with a review of our property-liability results on slide four. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, property-liability earned premium of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 was 4% higher than the same period of last year. Recorded combined ratio of 98.4 increased 4.7 points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by the $827 million catastrophe losses Tom mentioned earlier. While the underlying combined ratio of 87.2 improved by 1.8 points.","Net investment income of $302 million for the property-liability segment decreased 15.6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by a decline in performance-based investment income, which had strong results in 2015. As a result, property-liability operating income in the first quarter was $291 million, which was $264 million lower than the first quarter of last year. The chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows property-liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates.","The red line represents policy in force growth versus the prior year and shows that policy growth was comparable to the prior-year quarter given actions in place across all three underwritten brands to improve auto returns. The blue line on this chart shows net written premium grew by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as average premium continued to increase. The bottom right-hand side of this page shows the property-liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results.","Let's go first to the red line, which shows the recorded property-liability combined ratio in the first quarter of 2016 was 98.4. This was 4.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015 result of 93.7 but included 6.7 more points in catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 87.2 showed by the blue bar was 1.8 points below the first quarter of 2015.","Slide five provides an update on our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan which is comprised of four parts: first, we're seeking approval for higher auto prices. In the first quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $335 million annually which is on top of the $1.1 billion of increases approved last year, as you can see from the bar chart in the lower left. The impact of these approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross premium per policy increased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy which lags written increased by 3.8%. Keep in mind Allstate brand auto rate changes take six months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium while they take 12 months to fully earn in.","Secondly, we tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business and underperforming segments. As we achieved target underwriting results, these guidelines are being modified. Focus on claims operational excellence and precision is always a priority, but Allstate brand auto property damage severity increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2016 which is a rate of increase we believe to be higher than what can be explained by inflationary increases. Continued stress on the auto repair industry from higher industry frequency, cost of repairing newer more complex vehicles and a higher total loss volume has caused steadily increasing claim severity. Our team is working to address these industry challenges and create a competitive advantage for Allstate.","Property-liability expense ratio decreased by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 reflecting lower marketing costs and expense reductions. Marketing was purposefully reduced given the rate and underwriting actions we were implementing providing the opportunity to enhance our marketing programs. New campaigns for both Allstate and Esurance will be launched in later this year.","Slide six highlights the benefits of these profit improvement actions for Allstate brand auto and the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlined combined ratio of 95.9 in the first quarter of 2016 was three-tenths of a point higher than the first quarter a year ago reflecting continued higher levels of accident frequency and higher severity. While property damage frequency in the first three months of 2016 moderated somewhat from prior quarters, still increased on a paid basis by over 2%.","As we've discussed, frequency is evaluated on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons such as managing claim staffing, evaluating cost trends, and estimating ultimate losses. To provide additional transparency into how these measures relate, we added a footnote to the investors supplement that isolates the impact that including fixed objects hit by a vehicle had on gross frequency which is likely larger than that on a paid frequency basis. These types of changes are accounted for in our processes and had no impact on pricing or our financial results.","The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to increase as approved rates resulted in a 4.7% increase in premiums written in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the first quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% compared with the first quarter of 2015 due to higher frequency and severity and was partially offset by lower expenses per policy. The positive GAAP between these two trends widened in the first quarter as earned premium growth outpaced the increased loss costs in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 1.7 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due mainly to improved loss ratio.","Allstate brands homeowners results are shown on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left you can see the significant impact catastrophes had in the first quarter of 2016 given the gap between the blue column and the red line. On an underlying basis continued favorable non-catastrophe frequency and severity and lower expenses resulted in a 59.4 underlying combined ratio in the quarter which was 5.3 points lower than the prior-year's quarter. The components of the first quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right.","Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,091 or 2.2% over the prior year quarter while underlying loss and expense per policy decreased by 5.8%. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio rose by 3.4 points from a very favorable 56 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Slide seven provides a view of the financial trends for both Esurance and Encompass. These charts on the top of this page show the component parts of the combined ratios for both brands. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 106.3 in the first quarter of 2016 was 11.6 points lower than the same period of a year ago reflecting decreased marketing investment, along with 4.4 point improvement in the loss ratio due to ongoing actions to improve auto returns. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 105.8 in the first quarter of 2016 was adversely affected by catastrophe losses that were 7 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio on Encompass of 88.3 was 2.3 points lower than the first quarter a year ago, a result of ongoing underwriting and pricing changes to achieve target margins.","The charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both brands. In Esurance, policies declined by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015 while net written premium grew by 2.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago and Encompass net written premium declined by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 as the 9.6% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premium from increased rates.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks Pat. Slide eight provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the first quarter of 2016. There are three main businesses in Allstate Financial with a total of 6 million policies outstanding. A life insurance business that provides products sold to Allstate agencies, Allstate Benefits which provide life, disability and flex health products at the work site, and an annuity business which is largely closed for new businesses.","We began to reposition Allstate Financial in 2006 when we exited the variable annuity business, then accelerate the repositioning post the financial crisis in a low interest rate environment. The bar chart on the upper left shows that there's an impact to the balance sheet over the last four years with total reserves declining by $21 billion due to exiting the broker dealer and bank channels for deferred annuities and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.","Notice that the grey bar representing immediate annuity reserves has been relatively constant. Although these annuities begin paying out benefits immediately upon issuance, they have extremely long lives. The current financial results are shown in the upper right. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% in the quarter versus the prior year driven by 9.6% growth of Allstate Benefits and an increase in traditional life insurance products.","Net investment income declined to $419 million or 13.4% as you saw long duration fixed income bonds in the immediate annuity portfolio in the third quarter of 2015. These sales harvested the gain on these bonds given the decline in interest rates. The proceeds will be shifted over time to performance based investments which are expected to generate higher long-term returns. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide.","Operating income was $104 million for the first quarter reflecting the decline in investment income. As you can see from the chart on the bottom, the decline was concentrated in the annuity business.","Moving on to slide nine, you can see the shift in investment allocation for the Allstate Financial portfolio. We reduced investment grade fixed income securities shown in blue from 68% to 60%, increased our holdings of investments where asset-specific performance drives more of the return such as limited partnerships and equities. The shift to public equities and performance-based investments is expected to deliver increased long-term returns over time.","The chart on the bottom left is based on historical return data from 1800 to 2015. On average, regardless of the time horizon, equities have historically out performed fixed income, as you can see from the grey columns. On the right two columns on the table, the risk, as measured by the 99% loss level for fixed income is lower and up for equities over a one-year time period. By 10 years, the risk of loss is the same but the returns are more than double. Since we can hold the investment back in the immediate annuity reserves for a long period of time, performance-based assets are expected to generate additional shareholder value. However, the challenge from a financial reporting perspective is that these returns fluctuate quarterly impacting reported operating earnings.","The chart at the bottom right shows that while our performance-based long-term earned yield and returns fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the ten year internal rate of return has trended consistently in the range of our long-term return target of above 10%","On slide 10, our GAAP total return on investment portfolio shown at the upper left was 2% for the first quarter. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent and valuations were positive in 2016 as fixed income marks increased on lower interest rates. The unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to about $2 billion as you can see on the upper right. Overall investment income of $731 million was 14% lower than the first quarter of 2015, but two-thirds of this decline reflects a good return from performance-based investments, 9.4% on an annualized basis versus what was a great quarter a year ago.","Investment income and yield by business segment are provided at the bottom of the slide. To the left is property-liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013 and yield is now increasing reflecting our increased allocation to high yield bonds and performance-based long-term investments.","As I noted earlier, we took actions last year to reduce interest rate risk in the Allstate Financial portfolio and began to increase performance-based investments back in the immediate annuity portfolio. While we realized capital gains, the shorter duration lowered the interest bearing yield to 4.5% as shown by the black line in the chart to the right. We are currently well positioned to shift to performance-based investments as well as to extend the duration of our fixed income portfolio at the appropriate time.","Slide 11 provides overview of our capital strength and cash returns for the first quarter of 2016. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and flexibility. We finished the first quarter of 2016 with $20.3 billion of shareholders' equity and deployable holding company assets of $2.9 billion. During April 2016, we completed the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that was announced last year and, as Tom mentioned, our board of directors authorized a new $1.5 billion program yesterday to be completed no later than November of 2017. Generally, we fund our annual share repurchase activity with net income less any capital we need to retain to grow the business and pay our common dividend. Our repurchase activity has been enhanced over the past few years by a number of proactive capital and risk management actions.","For example, the actions we undertook to strengthen the balance sheet by issuing hybrid securities, preferred stock enabled us to return capital in excess of net income over the past three years. The sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2014 freed up an additional $1.2 billion of capital which was also used to repurchase common shares. In the last 12 months we repurchased 9% of outstanding shares, increasing pro-rata ownership and earnings per share leverage. Since the beginning of 2010, we repurchased 36% of year-end 2009 outstanding common shares and have paid $2.8 billion in common dividends, representing a total $12.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders.","With that, I'll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for hosting the call. I appreciate the chart you had in your presentation about the increase in average premium. In the auto profitability measures slide, in your supplement, the loss ratio looks like it stabilized. Nevertheless, I'm wondering when should we expect that to start improving in the context of your rate actions that you've implemented over the last year.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg. It's Tom. As you know, and Pat mentioned it, it takes a while. So when we get a price approved, we obviously have to go through the regulators, and then once we do that, we have to program it in and start to roll it out to our customers, and those policies roll out over six months. And then of course it takes another six months before you collect it all. Matt can talk about the pace of change, but his team has been highly focused on this and aggressive making sure we are ahead of where the industry is going in terms of getting our pricing fixed so that when they catch up with us, we'll have an opportunity to grow again at profitable levels.","Matthew E. Winter - President","Greg, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. Everything that Tom just said is true, and that would be true if we were in a completely static environment, but we're not. So we're in a still moving environment. So we did see auto frequency moderate in the first quarter compared to the last half of 2015. And as a result, as you said, because of the rate taken, average earned begun outpacing loss cost trends in the quarter. That's a really good thing. But we are questioning whether some of the moderation of frequency may have been due to weather in the first quarter; we don't know. But we're not sure exactly whether or not we've seen the rise \u2013 the end of the rise in auto frequency, a stabilization or just normal fluctuation.","So from that perspective, we continue to execute on our profit improvement plan, and we refine that profit improvement plan as time goes on and we get more information, greater clarity on the trend line, and that's true not only on frequency but it's true on severity as well. And as you've seen, I'm sure you've looked at fourth quarter Fast Track, it showed a clear acceleration across the industry in PD and collision severity. That's due to total loss is up, higher cost to repair more complex cars, greater number of parts replaced, a whole host of different factors. Allstate has historically outperformed the industry in managing those costs. It looks like in first quarter we may have given up some of that advantage due to responding to the high catastrophe load and increased frequency, but our goal is to get back to our competitive position there and lead the industry.","But the end result of all of that is that we'll continue to execute all four components of the profit improvement plan. We'll continue to monitor the emergence of both frequency and severity trends, and we'll ensure that we are keeping pace with loss cost trends because we know that once you fall behind those trends, it's really hard, due to the timing Tom referred to, to really ever catch up quickly.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Greg, sometimes people are trying to forecast the combined ratio by quarter. You can do that. Obviously, what Matt just said is what he's been executing on which is we've made \u2013 we're getting good returns in the auto business today, but we've gotten much more attractive returns given our competitive position, and we're headed to do that. You could do the math, you could look at that bottom left-hand chart, you could look at the $1.1 billion or the $300 million, you can forecast about what time you think it will come in. You can \u2013 it's not complete dollar for dollar, but we have pretty high effectiveness on getting that through. And then you could look at just what happened to frequency and severity. So what Matt is saying is we're just at this, we know we need to make more money in auto insurance. We've made great progress, but we're not done yet.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Excellent color. Thank you. Just one follow-up. How should we think about the expense ratio over the next several quarters in the context of, I guess, you've announced a new advertising campaign, and it's clear that you've booked substantial improvement in the expense ratio over the last three quarters?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, we have. Obviously, we're always trying to make sure we watch expenses, whether that be our marketing expenses, our technology expenses or our general overhead expenses. And our team has a lot of work going on on that third category. In marketing, you're right, it did come down. We took the opportunity. There's really no reason to continue to bang away and drop lots of money on advertising if your underwriting standards are tight and you don't really want to grow.","Despite the fact that more people are shopping, one of the reasons we try to get out ahead of it is with our brand and our marketing we want to be open for business when other people are raising their rates so we pick up those shoppers. And so I think you should expect to see our expense ratio go up, but we're going to manage it to make sure that we still get the combined ratio target we're trying to get to. We did take this opportunity to refresh some of our programs and we feel good about what we're going to launch. But it's not like we went dark either. We advertise all the time. We look for folks. We have stuff going on. So it's not like we shut the place down, we just toggled it back a little bit.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just a question I guess on the capital management. $1.5 billion buyback, it sounds like over the next five or six quarters with the common dividend it doesn't seem like it would quite add up to sort of what the street is thinking of for overall operating earnings. Just curious if we're at a point now where you think about needing to retain some capital to grow whether it's through M&A or just organic growth? I know in the 10-K you mentioned your strategic priority is now to build and acquire long-term growth platforms, not just to build. So I'm just curious if there is any M&A component to that. Thanks.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, this is Tom. We have plenty of financial fire power to do whatever we need to do. Steve mentioned our debt to capital ratio is lowest it's been, I think, since I've been here and I've been here over 20 years. And we're in really strong position if we need to do anything. Steve mentioned that the thing that we had done historically, so last $3 billion program, had over $1 billion in it from Lincoln Benefit Life.","So I think what happens is sometimes the confusion is people get the capital actions in the divestitures mixed up with how much we need to grow in that. And so we think this is the right amount of money, it keeps the company really strong. We have plenty of capacity to either grow our business, handle any kind of large catastrophes that might come our way or see if we find something that's attractive to us externally, we would want to add to the portfolio, we can do that. And Steve can \u2013 I mean, Steve went through the variance. Was there anything else on the variance of how we got to $1.5 billion that you want to hear more about or are you okay with that?","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, that sounds like it's just largely attributed to the deployment of excess, so that's fair. And I guess my follow up is just Esurance and how we should think about the road to profitability from here. Because for a while, it seemed like the story there was scale the top line and also improve the loss ratio. The loss ratio actually looks pretty good now, down near 73, but it doesn't look like it's growing and we're at like 105 combined. So just I guess what's the path to a sub 100 combined ratio on Esurance? Thanks.","Don Civgin - President-Emerging Businesses, Allstate Insurance Co.","Ryan, it's Don Civgin. Let me give you an overview on that. First, if you recall, we acquired Esurance for strategic reasons so that we could grow in the segment where customers wanted self-service and a branded experience. We have from the very beginning been running Esurance from an economic value basis as opposed to GAAP. So with the difference in accounting between the advertising being expensed in the quarter you spend it, if you run it for GAAP combined ratio, it is hard to drive it. So we've been looking at economic value. The business is twice the size it was roughly when we bought it. The GAAP numbers do matter because it's growing to be an increasing size of the Allstate portfolio.","So they have spent the last roughly two years working to improve the performance of the business on a profitability basis. They've improved the loss ratio, but they've also had some operational catch up because while it's a direct business, it isn't all done online. We still have claims adjusters, we still have customers to take care of, we still have call centers. I'm really happy with the progress they've made. The combined ratio is in much better shape than it was a year ago. The number you're looking at, the underlying of 105, includes, as Tom mentioned, 3.4 points of investment in product expansion and geographic expansion that's not currently paying off in the current period.","Underneath that, the loss ratio improved by over 4 points over last year. So very happy with where it is. You're right it's still over a hundred, but out of that 105, I think you have to look and take that investment of 3.4 points out. And then there's still some room on the expenses for them to bring both advertising and non-advertising expenses down. So I feel good about where they are. As far as the growth, yeah, they didn't grow this year, but in the first quarter, but they also spent 36% less on marketing. That's not a direct correlation, but they are running a better more effective business. And as Tom said, we're feeling good about where it is, and it is still our growth vehicle in that segment, but we needed to get some operational things sorted out first.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, everyone. Two questions. One is can we talk a little about your rate need in auto going forward and maybe touch on rate need in Texas homeowners on top of that? And my second question relates to mass hitting about two or three quarters ago, but we're getting well ahead of it. There's always this fourth quarter seasonality in losses that didn't happen at all last 4Q as we start discounting the end of the year into our thoughts, was that seasonality just a coincidence?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Josh, it's Matt. I'll start with the first question about rate in auto going forward. You know that we don't disclose our rate plan for the year. We do disclose the fact that we have every intention of staying ahead of our loss cost trends, and as we monitor those, we continue to take rate as necessary. We have robust rate plans. We revise and amend and change them on an almost ongoing basis as we watch the emergence of loss costs.","The only thing I can tell you is that there is some public information about rates that has already been filed and approved so far this quarter. You're free to go and search out publicly available information, but I can't give you anything beyond that.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And can we talk about Texas onto that specifically, whether a cat in Texas is a rate issue or whether it's just a volatility issue?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Well, I'll answer it this way: as we look, we always have a cat load that we take into account as we're looking at rate need overall. We have to figure out what is normal volatility and normal catastrophe activity and when we're at a new norm and whether weather patterns are changing and non-modeled cats are increasing due to global warming, we will and are continuing to look at that. And if we determine that this is a new norm, we will price appropriately for it. But that's a tough question, and I don't think that we will change something based upon a set of cats that took place over a ten-day period. So it will take more than that. But it's a good point that we have to look at whether or not we're in a new weather environment and a new cat environment, and if so, how we react. I guarantee we will react to ensure that we earn economic risk-adjusted returns in Texas and every other state where we have cat exposure.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And seasonality of the loss ratio. Anything behind that or is that just a magical thing?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Boy, everybody has a theory on this one. I personally will tell you that we don't believe that there's any historical trend in seasonality that holds true all the time. There's generalities, but last quarter was one of the warmest first quarters in the last 20 years. Things change, and who knows what's going to happen in fourth quarter in terms of weather, in terms of catastrophes. And so I don't put that much credence into kind of seasonality predictions. I think they're informative, they help us plan for things, but there have been more exceptions to the rules lately than the rules.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me add one. So as Matt pointed out, he looks at \u2013 and our team really focuses on homeowners by state, or by in total, which you saw the numbers in total, by state and by territory, right. So it's broken down. What I would say is that severe losses like hail, straight-line winds, or tornados do come through the pricing models faster than severe losses that are caused by hurricanes or earthquakes because of the longer term nature of the actuarial science on that.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's a good answer. Thank you, Tom. And thank you, both and good luck in the rest of the year.","Matthew E. Winter - President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to start with a kind of a numbers question, in a sense I want to make sure I understand. So you said this quarter the weather appeared to be light in auto and home and that's probably driving the frequency benefit. And so the headwind there would be \u2013 in the future may be loss ratios would sort of bounce back, but the upside from an investor perspective is that you're not going to slow raising price increases because you're not ready to declare victory on frequency yet. So that's my first actuarial question.","And my second related point, I'm just looking at your BI severity which has been negative for a couple of quarters and I'm trying to understand what's driving that, whether it's the claims initiatives that you've been working through or if that's more environmental? And I'm trying to get to do we actually think \u2013 do we think that those favorable trends persist and ultimately if the underlying sort of net trend for auto maybe is going to be challenging from here? Thank you.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh, so Matt will answer your question, but just to be clear, we didn't say that favorable weather impacted first quarter results.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Excuse me. Thank you for correcting.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I just wanted to be clear. It just is what it is.","Matthew E. Winter - President","Yeah, Josh, it's Matt. I think your question is really about \u2013 I think you referred to it as actuarial, but I think you were referring to whether or not if we have some uncertainty about some of the causal factors in gross frequency, whether that impacts our ability to price and take rate. Rate indications are at a paid, not at a gross and they're based upon your net trends and your indication, and we go to the regulators and the insurance departments with a robust actuarial package that shows net trends current indications. And so most of that, quote, uncertainty about telling you what we think weather did to gross frequency trends last quarter is irrelevant to the pricing packages that we've put together which are based upon much more precise information.","As far as the BI severity and why it's down, yes, you are correct, we have talked to you about our enhanced medical injury handling program. Part of that is an attempt to get through BI cases quickly, especially those that have enhanced injuries. And so a lot of the decrease in BI severity that you saw this last quarter was a mix issue because we're paying a lot more current claims. The more current claims tend to be lower severity claims. That's one of the reasons you see BI frequency up a little this quarter because we handled a bunch more claims, and we went through them.","And so you always have that volatility in results in long-tail coverages, and there's a lot of complexity in BI. So it's hard to look at BI paid severity on a quarter-by-quarter basis and make any sense out of it. You have to look at it on the longer term basis, and you have to look at it in conjunction with the frequency to see how much of that volatility is influenced by mix. And in this last quarter, we think a fair amount was influenced by mix. That being said, we think we're making good progress in managing BI severity appropriately.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So that's really helpful color. I guess, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm trying to sort of synthesize what the net take away would be from all this. Which is I think you're probably going to continue raising prices at more or less the rates you've been because you're going to look through the severity thing as sort of mix driven and at the same time the frequency you're going to rely on the paid data more than the gross?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Well, that must be a Josh question because both Joshes have tried to get me to predict my rate taking activity, which I can't do.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, I thought I'd call it actuarial.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think to be fair we'll go through a period where we'll have to continue to raise prices.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I can ask an easy one, then. So I've been happy to see PIF growth has not gone negative in spite of the rate initiatives on the core auto business. Is anything in particular you guys are doing to offset that? Or is this just more a function of the fact you've got such sticky customer relationships that you have an inelastic book?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would point out actually our items in force were down this quarter from where we ended the year. So when you look at it sequentially, you really have to \u2013 we're down. We expect it to be down some. We're growing in other parts of the company. But this does have an impact on growth. We knew it was going to happen. We managed through it. We spend a bunch of time talking to our customers about policy changes and price increases. And so when you're doing that, you're not out trying to find new customers. So we're just working our way through it.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. On the Allstate brand homeowners business, the first quarter ex-cat combined ratio was slightly under 60%. That's a pretty big improvement year-over-year but was actually up relative to the fourth quarter. I'm trying to get a sense of whether you feel you can keep it at or below that 60% range.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we started this, really \u2013 and you'll remember, Jay, I don't remember how many \u2013 maybe five, six years ago, we said we felt that the business needed to, with catastrophes over time, run in the low 80s% and then you can put in whatever kind of cat load you want. We're running there today. We're comfortable with it. The underlying bounces around a lot quarter-to-quarter. We didn't note in the fourth quarter that we thought that was a pretty low level at 56% and change because cat loads are typically not that high so that you need to be below 60%. So we're just trying to make sure we're competitive in the marketplace, give our customers a good return, handle the volatility. But because we handle that volatility, our shareholders get a good return, which based on the required capital levels we had initially meant in the lower part of the 80s%.","That said, because we've improved the profitability, we now need to keep less capital, and so we manage it, as Matt said, we manage the stuff dynamically on \u2013 we're always looking at what's the right return on capital by state, by territory, and we adjust for it. So I think you should expect us to continue to deliver good risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders given that we're willing to take on the volatility of quarters like this quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. And then when I think about scenarios like we have with the Texas floods, I'm sure if it's disclosable we'll hear about it in a couple of weeks, but in that type of scenario, is there homeowners risk of loss there during a flood, or is that really just more focused on auto comprehensive?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, obviously there's a risk of loss because homeowners will lose stuff when the house floods. The federal government sells flood insurance, we do not. Are there things that could go along with that? Cars get flooded out, stuff like that, sure. But we factor all of that into our pricing. So the Texas floods largely would not be one of the big elements we'd be responsible for.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's what I thought. And then finally on the buyback, the $450 million that was done the first quarter, I'm just trying to square your comments around that. With regard to the new authorization, which my sense is typically it gets done earlier than is outlined, but the $450 million, should we view that as kind of a normalized quarterly run rate or is there perhaps some upside to that in terms of size?","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So this is Steve. The $450 million is probably a little higher than what we're going to have as we go forward. That was based on the prior program. I think I've said before what we do is we actually have outside parties perform the share buyback for us on the basis of a grid. And if you remember, earlier in the quarter, we were lower \u2013 our stock prices went down a little bit, so we were at a lower part of that grid and we didn't buy back as much stock. I'm sorry, we bought back more stock because our price was down a little bit, which caused us to do the $450 million versus a somewhat lower number, which is why we ended the program in April versus a couple months later.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. And good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Two quick follow-up questions, if I may. The first I guess goes back to what Greg was asking about the loss cost trends. On the last call, you had talked about competitors and spent more time on the industry. Recently one of the larger companies had adverse development in their results. Does that sort of news \u2013 did that lead you to maybe take a pause or sort of recalibrate the growth plans for 2016? Or do you just feel that, okay, this is others addressing the issues that we have addressed in the past?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Amit, it's Matt. It's an interesting question. But let me be clear that we have an Allstate philosophy for both how we reserve, which is very conservatively. Somebody else's prior-year development is really not that instructive for us. It's interesting, we look at it. It always provides context and information, but we have fairly precise ways that we approach this and that we ensure that we're reserved appropriately.","And as I said when I answered Greg's, I think our level of detailed study as we determine where to take rate, how much rate to take, what the net trends are, what the indications are, number one, the level of thoroughness has shown up in our effectiveness in getting rate approved in each of the states. But two, it allows us to react to our information as opposed to others. Everybody is in a different place. Everybody is in a different place in terms of what the rate is, where their rate is, how much rate they need to take to respond to current trends. We saw at the beginning of last year very few people talking about any frequency or severity issues. And then later on, everybody talking about it. So everybody's timing appears to be different, and we're focused on our own book of business, our own trends and our own math.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Fair enough. The only other question I had was going back to the discussion on expenses and the marketing campaign, did I understand this correctly? Is it just going back to the usual normalized level, or is this sort of a reboot for Allstate and Esurance brands?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What we were indicating is we're going to put some new creative out with some \u2013 that is incorporated into a marketing program which is, you know, becoming more and more heavily digital as opposed to mass media. And so we're constantly adjusting that one as well. We don't have an established percentage of premiums that we say this is what we want to spend. We do it the way it was done and Matt had mentioned. Like, if we think we can write the business economically and it creates shareholder value then we look at the cost per acquisition, and we go out and do it, and we look at that with great precision, whether that comes through online stuff or whether it's through TV ads or radio ads.","So what we're just trying to say is as it relates to expenses, the marketing expenses are down. They were down intentionally because we didn't really want to grow. And so now as we're coming through the profit improvement plan on auto, we will want to go back to growing. It will take us some time to get there. So this is not going to happen in every state, in every market, in every medium or every brand at the same pace. So I think you should expect to see our expense ratio increase a little bit as we go forward. But I don't think you should see it be a dramatic spike.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the answers, and good luck for the future.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question, please.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Allstate. I really appreciate the disclosure in the bottom of slide eight on Allstate Life decomposition of earnings. And hopefully we will get that prospectively and retroactively would be even better. As we think about the Allstate Life ROE progression, Matt, when you took over several years ago, the idea was to go into mortality, morbidity, and cut back spread products, and that's played out well. And the hope was even though you had some legacy drains in the annuity block that will run off over time, the higher profit ROE will take charge to drive it forward. Now you've had lower yields and some pressures, but where are we, Tom, on the ROE progression there? Can you take capital out of there going forward to help as well?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question, Bob. So as you point out, we've been working on improving the returns in that business for some time. We feel like we've been making good progress. But the other thing I would say is we look at ROE, but we really manage for shareholder value. So the items when you look at that lower right-hand side and see what happened to annuities in terms of operating income, that hurt the current ROE. But we're okay with that. It hurt it for two reasons. One is obviously we harvested, I think, it was over $0.25 billion of gains and basically front-end loaded, what would have come through as operating income into book value when we sold the bonds, and now we're going to put it in longer term investments that obviously takes a while to get invested. So you earn \u2013 as Steve pointed out, we'd like try to get about 10% on that stuff. It takes a while to get that investment in and to actually get to 10% because it doesn't happen on day one.","Secondly, it also makes us put up more capital because under the regulatory schemes, when you're investing your performance based investments, you put out more capital than you would put out some fixed income. We believe that's a good trade and in our shareholders' best interest. So we're willing to take an ROE hit if we believe that it generates long-term shareholder value, which in the end turns out to be total return-based for that immediate annuity portfolio. So we continue to work hard on. We've been taking capital out of Allstate Financial for, I don't know, Steve...","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Three years...","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Three years or something. So to the extent we can do that, to the extent we can use financing techniques in a variety of ways to do it, we continue to work on how do we raise the return on capital particularly as it relates to those annuity businesses. That said, we haven't come up with any what I would call synthetic approaches to do it. It's just been we've got to work the money hard.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. My follow up is a detour to commercial auto. You had a mild increase in reserves in the quarter. Where are you in that book pricing-wise and what drove the reserve increase?","Matthew E. Winter - President","Hi, Bob. It's Matt. Yes, thanks for noticing. Yeah, we did have some reserve strengthening. The vast majority of it was in commercial auto and then a little bit in prop. And it's the same drivers that existed on all the other underwritten standard auto brands, it was frequency, severity trends and unfortunately I don't think we were at the proper rate level when those hit, and so catching up takes a little longer. And we have to be more dramatic, and you have seen that and you will continue to see that. So we're going to move aggressively to get that business to the point where it's really serving what I think could be a really unique strategic purpose. In addition to bringing in appropriate risk adjusted returns.","This is a great marketplace for Allstate. The small business \u2013 we were Main Street, USA. We have a lot of our existing standard auto and homeowner customers' own small businesses. We have natural connections and a natural brand affinity, and my goal and our goal, the team's goal, is to get the profitability at an appropriate level, get the returns where they should be and then deploy this as a strategic asset as part of our broader trusted advisor strategy to serve the full range of customers with their full range of needs.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","We've seen the commercial auto movie before in the industry over the last several quarters. So the reserve increases have tended not to be cameo appearances, but I got every confidence that you'll get your arms around it.","Patrick Macellaro - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Matt. We'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Certainly.","Patrick Macellaro - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jonathan, sorry.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much for fitting me in. And first question is on the guidance. It looks like the first quarter 87 is below the 88 to 90 full year guidance? And it looks like the auto book will continue to improve over the coming quarters. So what is holding you back?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a 12-month forecast and we're 3 months in.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So I just wonder is there any seasonality or maybe the property book is better than what you anticipated?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We've just always said it's a 12-month forecast. We don't hold ourselves accountable for it. You'll remember last year we were bumping along towards the top end of the range. When we get to the third quarter, we thought we might actually end up outside the range so we let everybody know that, and we had a great fourth quarter and came in below the range. So it bounced around. We see no need to update our outlook there.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Then the bigger picture question, you have million cars connected through telematics and we have seen seemingly quicken pace in terms of technology advancements such as active safety as well as autonomous driving as well as the driving behavior like shared mobility. For all the auto industry, they tend to be backward looking using sort of actuarial table to determine rates and products. I just wonder how do you actively anticipate this technology changes that position your products and market position.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you point out, we now have I think it's 1,050,000 or so people currently connected to us on a daily basis. We pull different kinds of information from them. That enable us to do a couple things. You're absolutely right it enables us to price more accurately because when we are determining what we should charge somebody, we have to put them into groups and actuarially sort that out. In this case, we can basically put them into different groups because we know how you brake, what time you drive, there's a variety of things that enable us to give customers more accurate price and oftentimes that's a lower price more attractive price for them.","With that, we can also provide them that connectivity in the one hour a day they spend in their car is where we can add additional value for them. For example, today we have the safer you drive, the more rewards you get. If you can get safe drive rewards, it gives you discounts on things. Our customers like that. It improves our value proposition form. And so that will develop over time. We have a slightly different model than some of the other people in the business who are doing it mostly for the more accurate pricing. So they can do a one-time shot of people and get a sense that ours is a different model. I'm not declaring ours is the right one. I'm just telling we're taking a slightly longer term customer value look at that. We still have a lot of work to do to develop that to build those relationships and figure out how to interact with our customers. So this will be a lot of work for us that has the potential to generate additional value for our shareholders, but we're investing heavily in doing that.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. First, this is maybe a summary here. This is a kind of quarter that our business is built for. We had to protect people from uncertain things like hail storms that happen to them. At the same time, our shareholders can handle the quarterly earnings volatility, and as a result of that, get attractive returns. Secondly, we know how to run a property casualty business, and that shows up in the way we executed this year.","Our investment portfolio is thought about on a risk adjusted return basis, so we're trying to be thoughtful on both a short-term and long-term basis and again factoring in how we want to drive long-term value creation. And then the weather has gotten more volatile, which obviously is a growth opportunity for us because if some people have more disasters, they need more coverage, and we need to get back to growth in our auto and other businesses. But we're having good growth particularly in our benefits business this quarter.","So thank you for taking the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

I'll begin with an overview and then Pat, Matt and Steve will go through the results in detail. Also here with us are Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses, Kathy Mabe, who leads our Business to Business operations, Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","If you turn to slide two, you can see the financial performance for the second quarter 2015. The primary story for the quarter is that our proactive approach to running the business has accelerated the focus on quickly adapting to an increased auto insurance combined ratio. In addition, we continue to benefit from the repositioning of the homeowners business, make investment decisions that balance risk and return, and invest in long-term growth. Net income was $326 million for the quarter and $974 million for the first six months of 2015, as you can see from the table on the bottom of the slide.","Operating profit was $262 million or $0.63 per share for the quarter, which brings the total for the first six months to $878 million or $2.10 per share. Second quarter profit was lower than the prior year, driven by a deterioration in auto insurance margins, which was partially offset by strength in homeowners' margins. Investment income and Allstate Financial income were slightly lower than the prior-year quarter, as expected. Auto insurance margins decreased as higher claim frequency and severity more than offset average auto insurance price increases.","The increase in auto frequency is broad based across states, risk class, rating plans and tenure of customer. And while the recent growth in Allstate brand auto policies did increase frequency, since, of course, new business typically has higher relative frequency, this was not the primary driver of our higher combined ratio. Consequently, we believe this is primarily externally driven and supports fast response to loss cost trends.","Now, I know many of you have questions about if and how this will show up in competitors' results. We'll explain what our analysis shows, but as you know, each competitor has its own unique position. What is important to emphasize is that we've taken action and will continue to take action to improve profits based on our data. If and when competitors react to their results, it does not change our commitment to profitable growth. We are executing a comprehensive profit improvement plan for all three underwriting brands, it includes raising prices, tightening underwriting standards and lowering expenses. Matt will cover this in a few minutes.","The homeowners business continued to generate excellent underlying profitability and growth is accelerating. As a result of the auto profit actions and the strength of the homeowners business, we are not changing the goal of achieving an underlying combined ratio of 89 or less for the full year. Progress was made on the other four operating priorities as well. Policies in force continued to grow in auto, home and other property casualty lines for both the Allstate and the Esurance brands. Encompass policies in force declined. The combination of unit growth and price increases led to a $345 million increase in Property-Liability premiums earned for the quarter to $7.5 billion, which is a growth rate of 4.8% from the prior-year quarter, which you can see on the table on the bottom. Operating income return on equity was 11.9% for latest 12 months. We also continue to provide excellent cash return to our common shareholders, with total cash returned through dividends and share repurchases in the past 12 months of $3.1 billion.","The five 2015 operating priorities are shown on the top of slide three and the results for each brand and customer segment are shown below. At the bottom left is the Allstate brand, which represents 90% of premiums. Our strategy here is to increase the local advice provided by Allstate agencies, while profitably expanding the household relationships. We're making good progress on implementing this plan and believe we can execute it, while adapting to the broad-based increase in auto frequency.","Policy in force growth was 2.7% in total, as auto policies continued to increase at slightly above 3%. Homeowners' growth accelerated to 1.2% and other personal lines grew by 2.9%. You can see that in the table on the lower left. Net written premium growth was 4.4%, as the largest driver of which was a 4.9% increase in auto insurance premiums. The combined ratio was 98.7 for the quarter, 101.4 auto combined ratio offset attractive results for homeowners and other personal lines. Homeowners insurance had a combined ratio of 92.3, despite $528 million of catastrophe losses in the second quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand was 87.7 for the quarter.","Moving to the second largest segment, Esurance, in the lower right, growth in policies in force has come down from the prior year to 6.4%, as we've tightened underwriting standards, reduced discounts, raised auto prices and reduced advertising expenses. These actions were necessary to ensure that the doubling of the size of the business had appropriate pricing, particularly for preferred auto customers. Average auto prices increased by about 2%, which brought net written premium growth to 9.1%. The combined ratio declined by 2.1 points to 110.2 points, reflecting a reduction in expenses. Esurance also made good progress in expanding into homeowners insurance and are now offering the product in 19 states. This will enable us to both better serve customers, while lowering acquisition cost per policy.","Encompass in the upper left competes in the independent agency channel which serves customers who want local advice, but are brand neutral. As expected, policies in force have declined by 2.8% in this price sensitive channel, as we've implemented a wide variety of profit improvement actions. The profit improvement actions were initiated in response to our performance in the market before the upturn in auto frequency in the third quarter of 2014. Average auto premium was 4.2% higher than the prior-year quarter, which mitigated the impact of fewer policies in force, so the net written premiums declined by less than 1%. The combined ratio of 115.7 is lower than last year, but it's still too high at an underlying level of 96.5. Answer Financial, our aggregated model, has premium growth of 16% versus the prior-year quarter.","Now, across all brands, we continue to invest in two longer-term operating priorities; modernize the operating model and build long-term growth platforms. The operating model is being modernized with the retirement of legacy technology platforms and expansion of continuous improvement practices. New growth platforms such as Drivewise and DriveSense, our two telematics offerings, are expanding, and between them now have 881,000 customers. Now, let me turn it back to Pat to go through our Property-Liability results.","Patrick Macellaro - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. Let's start by taking a look at the Property-Liability P&L on slide four. Starting with the chart on the top of the slide, Property-Liability had net written premium of $7.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, 4.4% higher than the second quarter of 2014. Through the first six months of 2015, net written premium grew by 4.6%, while protection policies in force grew by 2.6%. Catastrophe losses of $797 million in the second quarter of 2015 were 14.9% lower than the prior-year quarter, but the impact was more than offset by deterioration in the underlying combined ratio, resulting in a recorded combined ratio of 100.1 and a small underwriting loss for the quarter. Recorded combined ratio for the first six months of the year was 96.9, which was 0.8 point worse than the first six months of 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the second quarter and first six months of 2015 was 89.1, elevated over the levels we experienced in 2014.","Net investment income of $292 million for the Property-Liability segment decreased 16.8% from the second quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower but still strong limited partnership returns in the quarter. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $198 million in the second quarter of 2015 was significantly below the prior-year result, while the $753 million of operating income through the first six months of 2015 was 9.5% below the first six months of 2014. The chart in the upper right is to help orient you to the respective earned premium contribution our three underwriting brands have for both auto and homeowners insurance.","Bottom of the slide contains growth trend information, as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. Protection premium and policy growth trends are in the chart on the bottom left. Red line represents policy in force growth and shows the continued positive policy growth trend that's being driven by the Allstate brand. Policies in force grew by 881,000, or 2.6% from the second quarter of 2014. Net written premium represented by the blue line grew $330 million, or 4.4% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with the same period last year, reflecting the combination of policy and average premium increases.","Exhibit on the bottom right displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratios for the second quarter of 2015, along with some history. Both the recorded combined ratio of 100.1 and the underlying combined ratio of 89.1 were impacted by higher auto losses in the second quarter versus the prior-year quarter.","Slide five highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of the slide provides a historical view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. Echoing Tom's comments on auto profitability, you can see that the Allstate brand auto recorded combined ratio for the second quarter of 2015 deteriorated by 6 points compared to the quarter a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 97.8 in the second quarter, also 6 points higher than the prior-year quarter.","The chart on the right highlights the trends driving the deterioration in the underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to increase over the prior year in the second quarter, but at a slower rate than average underlying losses and expenses per policy, which are shown in red. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy increased 8.6% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2014. While you can see the second quarter of last year was relatively low, the increase in the results in the second quarter of 2015 was not entirely driven by a low base. Matt will provide some color on what's driving these trends.","Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this slide. On the bottom left, you can see the impact of seasonally-high catastrophes on the homeowners' recorded combined ratio, which was a 92.3 in the second quarter of 2015. The underlying combined ratio of 60.7 in the second quarter of 2015 was a half point higher than the prior-year quarter, but well within its expected range. On a trailing 12-month basis, the underlying homeowners combined ratio was a strong 61.6.","Trends that drove the second quarter underlying combined ratio on homeowners are in the chart on the bottom right. As you can see, average earned premium per policy continued to increase over the prior-year quarter, although at a slower rate than in the past, given the achievement of target returns and the subsequent transition to more inflationary rate activity in this line of business. Underlying losses per policy increased 2.7% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Allstate brand homeowners frequency was essentially flat to the prior-year quarter, and paid severity increased within our expected range.","Now, I'll turn it over to Matt to provide some further context on our auto results.","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Thanks, Pat. I'll start on slide six by providing some context about what is driving our auto results, how we are thinking through the trends and, most importantly, how we are responding to them. Last quarter, we said that increases in our auto claim frequency trends were evident broadly across geographies, risk classes and customer tenure. We noted that the trend appeared to be driven primarily by external factors, most notably by an increase in miles driven, and to a lesser extent, adverse weather in certain parts of the country. What we observed in the second quarter confirmed that. As you saw in our results, our bodily injury and property damage claim frequency trends were both significantly elevated compared to the second quarter of 2014.","As we have noted, frequency can be very volatile on a quarterly basis, and so year-over-year comparisons are difficult. Some of the increase we observed this past quarter was driven by the exceptionally strong performance last year, but our absolute levels of frequency in the second quarter were at the high end of our five-year expected range and were generally consistent with the elevated levels we experienced in the first quarter. The largest difference in the second quarter was that there was not a material impact to auto claim frequency from weather. As a matter of fact, the northeast part of the country, which bore the brunt of the winter weather earlier this year, performed better than other parts of the country in second quarter.","We continue to retest our hypothesis around the primary drivers of frequency, and our analysis continues to support the conclusion that these trends are principally driven by external factors. Miles driven and Allstate's auto claim frequency have historically been very tightly correlated with one another, particularly over shorter periods of time, as you can see from the chart on this slide. While miles driven isn't the sole driver of our increased loss trends, it does explain a significant amount of the result. And as you can see, miles driven have continued to increase rapidly over prior year, as the year has progressed. The slope of the three lines is very consistent over the past few quarters.","With three additional months of elevated frequency trends, we continued to look for different ways to validate or disprove our preliminary conclusions. One of the more meaningful insights we were able to produce came from an additional analysis we conducted looking at the loss experience of some of our most tenured customers, a block of business with a history of stable profitability. Many of these customers were written in underwriting companies that are not currently writing new risks and were written with a variety of rating plans.","What we found for the second quarter is that this group of customers also experienced significant increases in accident frequency, not dissimilar to the overall book of business. This reinforced our conclusion that the increases we're experiencing in auto claim frequency are primarily being driven by external factors that impact our auto book broadly. Frequency also tends to bounce around a bit, so quarterly trends and comparisons can be a bit volatile. When you look at PD and BI frequency over a two-year period and compare the second quarter of 2015 with the same period in 2013, the annual increase is about 2%.","As you know, new business normally runs at a higher frequency level than renewal customers. We often refer to this as a new business penalty. With that in mind, we want to quantify this impact in our auto book, particularly in light of the positive growth trends we've experienced over the past couple of years. So we analyzed how the volume of new auto business we've written in the past two years has impacted our results and our analysis indicated that the new business growth rate is having between a half a point and a point impact on the auto loss ratio. This impact was expected and manageable. It is, however, a contributing factor to the higher frequency we are seeing. We continue to monitor new to renewal trends across our 15 local market operating committees in the U.S. and Canada.","So, that's what we are experiencing. Let's turn to slide seven and I'll provide some insight into how we are adjusting to these trends. My comments are going to be about Allstate brand auto, which is almost 90% of the auto business. Nevertheless, the actions we are taking in the Allstate brand are consistent with the actions taken by the teams in Esurance and Encompass. We have a multi-faceted plan underway to improve auto margins. First, we are broadly increasing rates to catch up and then keep pace with increased loss costs. Allstate brand auto approved rate increases in the second quarter were worth 1.5% of written premium, which is almost four times the amount of rate increases that were approved in the first quarter.","We know this is a number you are interested in, and know that you turn to different sources to attempt to get a sense for what we and others are doing between quarters. Unfortunately, it seems that there is a lot of inconsistency in how those sources identify and report on these rate increases. So I would encourage you to reach out to Pat, if you have any questions on these.","In conjunction with our broad rate increases, we are also engaged in very targeted and segmented rate actions and underwriting changes, wherever we identify specific underperforming segments of business. Those rate actions and underwriting changes are taken in conjunction with our ongoing correct classification programs to ensure we are adequately matching price and risk. We've also looked at our internal operations and are taking expense improvement actions across the company, including reductions in advertising, technology, professional services, and employee-related costs.","So that's our action plan to address the frequency pressure we've seen. Let me talk for a minute now about severity. There are several trends we are watching that might influence severity in addition to normal inflationary pressures. Many of these trends are related to increasing vehicle complexity. First, there's an increase in newer cars on the road with expensive electronic components. Secondly, there's growth in the average number of parts replaced per claim; and third, we've seen an increase in more labor hours per claim. Additionally, the largest increase in miles driven has been on interstate roads where accidents obviously occur at higher speeds. So while most of our discussion today has been around increasing frequency, we are also concerned about and reacting to what we believe could be some additional pressure on loss severity. As a result, we will continue to focus on operational excellence in our claims operation to ensure maximum efficiency, rapid cycle time and the proactive management of loss cost.","Let's turn to slide eight and I'll help you understand what you should expect from all of these actions. The chart on this slide gives you an idea of how much earned premium we would generate through 2016 if filed and approved rate increases had ceased on June 30, which, by the way, they did not. 2015 Allstate brand auto rate increase approved through June 30 will generate written premium of approximately $323 million. The rate at which this premium will be earned by month is shown by the gray bars on the chart. As a reminder, Allstate brand auto brand policies have six month terms, so they take, on average, a little over 12 months to fully earn in a rate increase. Approximately $155 million of the rates approved through June 30 will be earned in the second half of 2015. In addition, we continue to earn in premium from rates approved in 2014, which is shown by the blue bars in the chart. The total we expect to earn in calendar year 2015 from rates approved last year is $243 million. These actions in total will likely result in slower auto policy growth in the Allstate brand. We have already seen the impact of profitability actions on the auto policy growth rates in Esurance and Encompass.","So to summarize, our action plans are based on a great deal of detailed analysis of both internal and external data surrounding the recent loss pressure we are experiencing. We will continue to refine our analysis and our understanding the drivers of these frequency trends. Most importantly, however, is that while we continue to do this analysis, we are already taking swift and decisive action to address these trends and bring our auto profitability back to targeted levels. And now I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll cover Allstate Financial, investments and capital management.","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Matt. Slide nine provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results. We have strategically repositioned Allstate Financial to become more integrated with the Allstate brand customer value proposition. Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter are highlighted on the left-hand side of this slide. Premiums and contract charges increased 3.5% when compared to second quarter 2014, as Allstate agencies have become more engaged in selling life and retirement products. Operating income for the second quarter was $139 million, 15.8% lower than the second quarter of 2014. This reduction in operating income was driven primarily by lower limited partnership income and higher life mortality than in the prior year's second quarter.","As we did with the Property-Liability portfolio in prior periods, we are reducing the risk of rising interest rates in the Allstate Financial investment portfolio by selling longer-term fixed-income securities and investing the proceeds in shorter-duration fixed-income and equity securities. The chart on the right provides a view of the Allstate Financial fixed income portfolio by scheduled maturity date at June 30, 2015 and the two preceding year ends. While reducing our interest rate risk and repositioning the portfolio maturity profile generates net realized capital gains, investment in operating income will reduce prospectively by the yield on the reinvested proceeds.","Moving to investments in the chart at the top of slide 10, following a strong first quarter, our portfolio total return was a negative 0.6% in the second quarter. The income yield has been stable, while our valuations were reduced by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads in the quarter. The bottom of the slide provides investment income and portfolio yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios and illustrates the consistent earnings profile of the interest bearing portfolio and the variability of our equity investments. The Property-Liability yield reflects prior duration shortening and ongoing investments in low interest rate environment. The Allstate Financial yield is higher and has been more stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and the use of its cash flow largely to fund annuity reductions.","Slide 11 shows our capital position is strong with excellent cash returns to our shareholders in the quarter. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $3.4 billion at June 30, 2015. During the quarter, we returned $642 million in cash to common shareholders through the combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 7.6 million common shares for $517 million in the open market and under the accelerated share repurchase agreement that settled on May 8, 2015. As of June 30, we had $1.9 billion remaining on the current repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by July 2016.","Now, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays; your question please.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Clearly I think the main topic of the call will be on auto insurance and how those margins can be improved. You outline on slide eight the impact of the rate increases beginning to materialize in the third quarter; but I think there's some concern around how fast overall the margins can improve either from the combination of rate increases and also addressing expenses. So perhaps you can give us a bit more clarity in your outlook on that. Thanks.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jay, I'll start and then Matt can join in. First, we think this is very doable that we can get margins back to where they were. Obviously, you can do your own estimate. We tried to provide some measure of how much dollars will come through the P&L on that slide that Matt showed. But also, you can look and know that we do disclose that we're increasing our price increases from where we've been so far this year, so you can factor that in. As it relates to expenses, I would say, what we're doing is tightening our belt, but we continue to invest in the future.","So, you'll remember in 2011, when we had issues in homeowner profitability, we continued to invest in long-term stuff like advertising and continuing to increase our expenses. Same thing is true this year. We're cutting some expenses, but we'll continue to invest heavily, for example, in things like DriveWise and DriveSense, which is the future for us. Matt can talk about both his prospects for rate increases and expense reductions.","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Sure. Thanks for the question, Jay. You mentioned rate increases and expense reductions. I'd also remind you that we considered the underwriting actions and correct class programs and things like that a third lever that we're engaging in this effort because we are, in fact, tightening some of our underwriting parameters, providing some increased focus on correct class programs and we'll continue to use underwriting in conjunction with that.","On the expenses, I'd point you to page 59 of the Q. We are clear there that the targeted expense reductions will represent approximately 0.4 point on the annualized Allstate brand expense ratio. So you can factor that into your calculations as well. As Tom said, we are accelerating to the extent possible our rate taking and so far we've been quite successful with the states. We're not getting a great deal of pushback. Our acceptance and approval level is high. We are doing it on a micro segmented basis, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","We're attempting to not just take broad rate increases, but to focus them on the specific segments where we're having underperformance or loss pressure, and so we feel good about our prospects for aggressively pursuing that. Obviously, on the slide I showed on earning-in the rate, I have to stop at the end of the second quarter, but you have to hypothetically add on to that what we might be able to take over the rest of this year and into next year, and it will compound and we feel comfortable that we will get back to an appropriate targeted level of auto profitability as quickly as possible.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that. Tom, with regard to the 87 to 89 underlying combined ratio target, given where we are in first half, are you essentially signaling you'll do whatever it takes to get it under 89?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We made the commitment because we believe we can get there, yes, Jay.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Can you give us any sense of what you're seeing in terms of auto profitability trends in July?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, given we just closed, no.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse; your question please.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess the first question is just on the 1.5% of rate that you've gotten on the book. Can we expect that number to be at least 1.5% for the remaining quarters of the year?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","1.25%? I'm not...","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","For the Allstate brand auto. The rate increases as a percentage of the starting book.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the rate increases \u2013 it's 1.25%; that's throwing me for a little bit. So it's 1.5% for the quarter and what we've indicated is we would expect it to go up as we move throughout the rest of this year, up from the 1.5%.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just back to Matt, I guess, on the expense ratio reduction in Allstate brand, the 0.4 points. That's net of the investments you talked about, so we should think about the expense ratio getting 0.4 point better, correct?","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Yes.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess my last question is just on thinking about trend versus the location specific rate increases. I guess location specific is 3.6%, which actually was a modest deceleration from the previous quarter, and just hearing you talk about your view of frequency, it's sort of 2% and severity picking up. I guess I'm just wondering why the location specific rate increases aren't greater than 3.6%.","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Yeah, Ryan, the state specific is influenced heavily by mix and that's not really a representative number to look at.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As it relates to severity, I think \u2013 Matt's point there was, we have a broad-based approach to making sure we're going to come in where we want to come in and he's just referring to there's no stone unturned.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley; your question please.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. So just follow up on that, if you look at your frequency up more than 6 points and severity like anywhere between 1 point to 4 points, add these together you're close to the high-single digits, so-called loss cost trends increase. So is that pricing increase you're instituting right now enough to catch up for those? And do you expect these loss cost trends continue at these levels that you would need more pricing increases basically to improve your underwriting results?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Kai, let me just set the bar. So as Matt mentioned, it is up and your numbers are absolutely correct as it relates to the second quarter. On one of the slides in the presentation you can see the dip down in costs in Q2 of 2014, and what Matt has said is, of course, some of the up is \u2013 that 6.9% is because of that down. But it's also just up higher than we'd want. So we're doing everything we think we need to do to adjust that. Let me maybe make a \u2013 so underneath that, perhaps, as it may be your question about did we react quickly enough, and I think Matt's team has reacted incredibly quickly to this and the system is fully aligned on improving profitability. Just to provide some details to that, when you look at total costs, that's the losses plus expenses, which combines both the frequency and the severity, as you point out, and you compare it to the rate of increases we're taking in pricing, that is an appropriate analysis. If you look at 2014, the first quarter was up a lot because we had bad winter weather. Then it was about the same, as the price increases, the costs were kind of moving along.","So about three-quarters of the way through 2014 everything looks fine. The fourth quarter, of course, as you know, went up and it exceeded our price increases. And then in the first quarter they came down a little bit, but were still pretty high. So it was really towards the back end of last year and beginning this year that Matt's team began to accelerate price increases. As we saw things develop in April and May, they accelerated that and increased their activity around profit improvement, which is the plan that Matt just took you through. So I think the system is working as planned. It is highly focused on making sure we earn an appropriate return and reacting quickly.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just follow on that, you mentioned about that connected rising pricing could negatively impact on your PIF growth. Just wondering, will that be a sort of lagging effect on the PIF growth? And do you still expect for the full year we see some, like, passive growth in the auto PIF?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Matt comment in specific where he's working, but let me maybe set some historical context. So, our unit growth in auto is over 3%, which is hard to tell whether you're picking up unit share, but it feels like we're picking up unit market share there. Homeowners, of course, accelerating at 1.2% and the other lines are increasing about 3% as well. The \u2013 this is \u2013 Matt mentioned, this'll have some impact on that auto growth line, but this is different than the results we're seeing in Encompass, where we're seeing a decline in PIF, and it's different than the reaction we had when we worked aggressively to adapt to other external conditions called homeowners and severe weather in 2009. So, we do mention in the press release that we expect overall items in force to increase. Matt can talk specifically about the impact on growth competition, what he's seeing even today as it relates to close rates.","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, it's important to distinguish between impacting growth rate and impacting growth. So, what we said was we expect the rate of growth to dampen a bit as these profitability actions take effect. We have had eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the auto business. We have been consistently improving that growth rate during all of that period. Retention has remained at fairly historic highs. New business has been exceptionally strong. And my only point in saying that the growth rate might decline is we do think that at some point, taking all of these rate and underwriting actions will dampen our ability to continue accelerating. That is not to say we expect not to grow. We will grow and we've said multiple times we intend to continue to add items in here. We just don't believe that we'll continue on the same trend line that we've been on.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Lastly if I may, on capital management, does this frequency issue with the delay, some of your capital management, how do you balance that? Because your operating earnings apparently is down a little bit year-over-year. You still expect this current pace of buybacks, or you'll take them back a little bit to just see how it plays out? And how do you balance also of course with your share price?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It has no impact on our capital plans.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank; your question please.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Josh.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So, two questions. First one, you can talk about the methodology behind paid severity versus incurred severity? And what are we seeing and how do those two things differ compared to what you publicly tell the Street?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we're struggling with what the question is, because \u2013 between...","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So In terms of your disclosures, when did you know \u2013 is this representing paid losses here? Are these incurred losses? And trying to understand when we see this, what are the chances that Allstate is being proactive and seeing a trend ahead of everybody else versus that Allstate is being reactive here?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me make a general comment and then Steve can fill in here. So, of course, paid is just what we paid out and we don't report incurred. But when we do our reserving, we do it on an absolute claim reported basis. So we look at how many claims are reported, and then we estimate what we think the incurred severity will be. We do that in a number of ways. We look at what's paid out on claims, we look at field reserves. We adjust those field reserves for the fact that they develop upwards over time. And then we have, of course, claims that have been incurred but not reported.","So, as opposed to \u2013 some people set their reserves based on a targeted loss ratio. So, they'll say you start the year off and say we're going to write $1,000 worth of business, we think the loss ratio will be 70, so they book $700 worth of losses. That's not the way they do it. I can't speak to whether that is \u2013 how other people do their reserving. I'm sure they're accurate and highly focused on it as well. There's lots of actuarial science and lots of review that goes on for anybody that reports this stuff. So, I can only tell you what we do which is \u2013 and so, the reason we report paid is, it's a good, clean number and it's easy for people to understand; incurred, of course, changes. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Really, simply, our incurred, as Tom noted, is the accidents that we're aware that happened. The paid is what we paid. So there's a lag, obviously, in that, but we do our reserving on a very real-time basis, and so that's how it how runs through our financial statements, and our paid is really catches up over time. You can see that in terms of the trends we have between those two lines.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And a couple of reasons that we do that. First, as it gets into pricing faster when we do it that way. And, secondly, as you look at paid, though, you should also note, it bounces around a little bit as we change claim practices. So, currently, we've changed some of the claim practices on major medical expenses and that's accelerated some of the payments of bigger claims. But we adjust for that when we estimate what we think the actual losses are for the quarter on which we report.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I realize that you don't disclose the incurred frequency number. But given the move in the quarterly combined ratio, is incurred frequency running ahead of paid frequency, or are they the same? Or you just have no comment on that matter?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We base our profitability based on the number of claims that have been reported and adjusted for those that we think have not been reported. So, it's actually live what happens. So, when we're closing July right now, we know exactly how many claims we had in July, and that's what runs through the P&L.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then another question and I'll get off this topic, but I'm sure someone else will pick it up. Five years ago we said let's just start over at Encompass; it's not working and we need to take major action. We're here five years later. Should I be thinking, even though I can't see it, that Encompass is a better business than it was five years ago?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a good question and one we talk a lot about. Let me maybe set the really long-term context, and then talk about where we are today. And Kathy can give you some specifics about the profit improvement programs.","So, first, we actually bought Encompass in 1999. At the time, it had a combined ratio of 117. We took it down into the low 90's, which was a good thing because it obviously generated a lot of profit for us. The even better news is, we didn't pay much more it. So it generated a good return on our capital. And so, even today, with its results, it looks like an acceptable return on capital. That said, this has been a difficult channel for us to maintain consist profitability. In part, there's intense competition, of course, at the point of customer interaction, and the customers tend to be highly price sensitive. We should be able to leverage both our auto and homeowners insurance expertise to compete effectively. That said, our current results aren't where we'd like them, but we have to continue to develop our capabilities to compete, as you point out, on a long-term basis.","Kathy can talk about the things we're doing specifically, today, to get that combined ratio down both on a recorded basis and underlying basis.","Katherine A. Mabe - President-Business to Business","Okay, thank you, Tom. Well, as you know, at Encompass we're focused on the mass affluent and we're focused strategically on building core strength around pricing and underwriting discipline, claims excellence, and really good distribution management. And with regard to the profitability challenges we're experiencing and continue to experience at Encompass, we're using a three-pronged approach. So we're looking at the same things that Matt talked about. Rate increases, underwriting actions and expense reductions. And you can see how we're leaning into rates, if you take a look at page 14 of the investor supplement. You can see almost 10 points of rate that we are planning to take or have taken, on the auto line, and it's broad based. It's across 29 states. So 85% of the book is getting a significant rate increase in the auto line.","In homeowners, we're also taking rates as well, and you can see that on page 14 of the investor supplement. And you can see, it's even more aggressive in location-specific rates, and we have a couple of really outlier states in terms of problematic performance. We're taking really strong action. And that's impacting that PIF number, that negative PIF number, significantly.","From an underwriting perspective, we're focused at agency level actions related to profit and correct class, like Matt talked about. Things like insurance to value. Some of the things that we needed to strengthen to compete in this channel.","And then, across the country, we strengthened our inspection standards on homeowners and looked at some of our payment practices around late pays and reinstates. From an expense perspective, you can see on page 59 in the Q that we're down 0.6 in the quarter and 0.8 on a year-to-date basis, and that's from managing our technology expenses, our people expenses, and our distribution costs. So, we've reduced commissions in our monoline auto line of business, because, as you know, in Encompass, we're focused on package policy growth.","So, your question is a good one and it's a journey that we've been on for a while in Encompass. We are working aggressively across all those fronts, the strategy around mass affluent, strong disciplined pricing, excellence in claims, and really skillful distribution management to reposition Encompass for long-term profitable growth.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good luck. Would love to see it.","Katherine A. Mabe - President-Business to Business","Me too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. On the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio of about 98%, how should we think about the trajectory of that going forward? Is it going to get worse before it gets better? Or are the rate actions you've taken so far enough to start to see an inflection point in that soon?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sarah, we're not \u2013 if you look \u2013 you'll have to do your own estimate, but I think we would expect that, if we are going to be at 89, below 89, we're obviously going to have to at least hold it, because of where we are with \u2013 we're at 89.1 for six months. So in all the actions Matt talked about, the rate slide, all that shows it burning in. You can estimate \u2013 you could calculate that, what you would think it would be by quarter, by fact, and we think we've given enough information about the prices we've already had approved. You can factor in then \u2013 to that what prices you think we will try to get approved and when those will roll in. And then you have the expense ratio number that Matt talked about.","On top of that, you'll have to make an estimate of frequency and severity, obviously. And Matt gave some numbers as to what the longer term trends are in frequency and severity. I would say, if you look at miles driven today, they're relatively high on an historical basis, and so frequency is up. Could frequency continue to go up, of course it could, which is why we always have a range and why we're adapting our pricing and profitability actions. So, you'll have to just make your own estimate of that piece. But we are not giving a specific by-quarter underlying combined ratio for auto insurance for the Allstate brand.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And does your guidance of 89% or better, does that contemplate the potential for deterioration in severity trends as well?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As you would expect, we've done all kinds of analysis around that. And we have a range of what the underlying combined ratio will be for this year, given that we are six months in and knowing what we know. But also knowing that there's a variety of things we don't know and can't predict. So, there's a range around that. But we felt comfortable that we would be below 89 to stay committed to it.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then if I can just get one more in, on the net investment income, how should we be thinking about the run rate there given some of the changes you made on the duration?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Judy talk about the specific net investment income. But I'll point out, just in terms of what we have done, right, so if you look at our investment position, we've tried to position the portfolios on the appropriate risk adjusted return basis. We're not trying to be a hedge fund and mark-to-market every quarter. If we don't like the risk per unit of return, then we make changes. And so, the changes we started making two or three years ago was for higher interest rates. And so we shorten the duration on the Property-Liability portfolio. As we disclosed, we started to shorten that duration in the long-term payout annuity block in Allstate Financial and some of the capital accounts this year, because we believe that the return per unit of risk for interest rates was not attractive to us. And then we began to shift into some idiosyncratic equity-like investments called performance based, which generate higher long-term returns on a risk-adjusted basis, but leads to more variability, as in limited partnership returns.","Judith P. Greffin - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer","So, Sarah, thanks for the question. As Tom said, we're taking action in Allstate Financial to reduce our interest rate risk, to improve our expected returns, and as a result, you'll see some gains as well as some deterioration in net invested income. As Tom also said, we are taking the actions in basically two places, in our long duration payout block, and there what we are looking to do, as Tom said, is reinvest primarily in equities. Initially, what you'll see is that will likely be in public equities, but over time we're going to move it into more of that idiosyncratic risk that Tom just talked about.","On the surplus side, we're shortening the duration, and there \u2013 that surplus account is going to look more and more like the protection account that Tom just mentioned where we shortened duration there and really kept it in fixed income for the most part, even though it's a balanced account. But that fixed income piece to that surplus account is just going to be at a shorter duration. As Tom said, as we look at the risk adjusted return of interest rate risk and just don't feel that we're getting paid to be in the longer end of the curve.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the important thing to think about from shareholder value creation is we believe in looking at long-term shareholder value creation, and so when we shortened the Property-Liability portfolio we took a pretty significant hit to operating earnings per share because we thought it was in our shareholders' best interest. You'll see not as large but also a significant impact as it relates to Allstate Financial in the short term because we're harvesting gains and giving up operating income. But we believe that's in the right interest of shareholders and we don't run the place just on operating EPS on a quarterly basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney; your question please.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Allstate. A quick question on how we should think about \u2013 on the first-quarter call you highlighted that you were seeing frequency ticking up and seeing a need to take decisive action. I was hoping to see that the PIF growth would slow, and in fact the PIF accelerated against a tough comparison. Maybe you could talk to what the dynamics are that led to the acceleration. Is that something we should think is a good thing or a bad thing?","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Bob, thanks for the question. We spent an awful lot of time and energy getting our agency force engaged, building up capacity, adding points of distribution, adding licensed sales professionals, entering markets where we had been geographically underpenetrated, and over time that along with some of the work we have done on the rating plans has improved close rates and quote rates and we have begun growing and the momentum has built on itself. And so while we have taken a bunch of rate actions and underwriting actions already that growth momentum has been so strong and so systemic that it has still not shown up to dampen those growth rates.","But, as we said several times during the call, that has a limit. I don't know exactly when that's going to occur. A lot of it depends upon competitor actions as well, and whether or not competitors are taking rates as well or whether they're waiting this out. It will depend upon the mix in different areas and geographic concentrations of our competitors.","So I think that growth is a good thing. Obviously growth with targeted levels of profitability is our goal, and so right now I'm focused, and the team is focused extensively on the profitability challenges to make sure we get that in line and so that the growth yields shareholder value, long term shareholder value in a long term, productive way.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, let me share some analysis that Matt did as well, which gets to the question of your competitors have better pricing or you are growing by being underpriced, which I think might be underlying your question there. And the data does not show that to be true. So he looked at one measure of competitiveness, of course, is your close rate and that's how many of your customers take the policy after they quote. And while price is not the only reason somebody would close, obviously we think they close because we give them good local advice and have great service, but it is obviously very important.","Those states where we have the highest close rate tend to have very low loss ratios, which would lead you to conclude we're not underpriced as a way of driving that growth. If you look at the bigger states, they have lower close rates than some of the \u2013 ones that have higher close rates, which are \u2013 they are more competitive states. But the vast majority of those big states have loss ratios that are below our targets. So the conclusion then is, we're winning through sophistication, not lower price.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Well, I have every conviction that you guys know how to do auto underwriting. The question is sort of what the timing is of getting to where you want to get to. And I think I'd have more conviction if you were shrinking rather than winning due to your good franchise. So I appreciate the answer, and those were thoughtful responses. If I could have one other quick follow-up, your expense ratio cuts, you said advertising. What other areas have you targeted as opportunities to cut expenses without getting to the bone?","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bob, so it's advertising, technology, professional services and several employee-related costs, and that's what we've disclosed and that's the action that we're taking.","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","Bob, it's belt-tightening. Not draconian.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We will take one last question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs; your question please.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just I guess following up on Bob's question, if I could. When you guys had \u2013 and I'm not comparing magnitude \u2013 but like when the homeowners business went through a period of difficulty, I mean you guys pulled back from growth, I mean it was no longer even on the table, and you did what you needed to do to get the profitability of that book back where you wanted it to be. And that was very successful. I guess my question is, at what point do you take your foot off the pedal, the growth pedal, not just sort of partially and not just sort of tipping your hat to profitability, but entirely and sort of focus attention exclusively on getting the profitability back where you want it?","Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company","It's Matt. Michael, let me make sure because maybe I wasn't as clear as I should have been in my opening remarks. One of the bodies of work that we did was to go back and look at whether or not the loss ratio pressure and the frequency pressure was showing up in the growth areas and in the new business, or whether or not it was showing up consistently across the books. And, in fact, when we did that analysis, we saw those old blocks of historically profitable business, long-tenured customers, unrelated to any of our recent growth. We're experiencing significant frequency changes as well, consistent with what the overall book is experiencing. So, the pressure we're seeing is not specific to growth segments. It's not specific to growth geographies. It's not specific to anything related to growth. We're seeing it across the broad book. So slowing down growth, the only part that that will impact is that what we refer to as the new business penalty, which is that differential with the normal new to renewal ratio. And as I said, we are monitoring that closely, and we will take appropriate action to ensure that we hit the targeted underlying combined ratio.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right.","Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, let me just close to say, first, Allstate's operating philosophy is profitable growth. When you compete in an industry that has an overall return on capital below our targets that means you have to have the guiding principle that profit is the biggest driver of shareholder value. Obviously, you have to be sophisticated and you have to react quickly, all of which we're doing. We've done this before, whether that's in homeowners or other businesses. We do are proactive in managing shareholder value on a long-term basis. So, for example, in the investment portfolio, we are willing to give up operating earnings per share, if we believe it creates long-term shareholder value. And we'll continue to operate with that philosophy of creating shareholder value. So, we expect to continue to drive results and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Nogal","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted today's presentation on our Web site at allstateinvestors.com.","Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further contacts on our recently announced transformative growth plan. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","And now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us and stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2 with Allstate strategy. So as you know, our strategy has two components to increase personal property liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. Starting with the upper oval, we've been a leader in creating differentiated insurance process features, such as declining deductibles new car replacement. We used sophisticated pricing, have strong claims expertise and are building an integrated digital enterprise to lower costs.","We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding our protection offerings, which are highlighted in the bottom oval. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities to drive growth in these businesses. So we offer customers a circle of protection that includes Allstate life, workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection.","These growth platforms have extremely broad distribution, includes major retailers, insurance brokers at the worksite, auto dealers, manufacturers, telcos and directly to consumers. On the right hand, you can see that this strategy create shareholder value to customer satisfaction, unit growth, and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.","You move to Slide 3, Allstate strategy and continue to deliver excellent results in 2019. Revenues were nearly 11.5 billion in the fourth quarter and 44.7 billion for the full year 2019. Net income was 1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.7 billion in the full year. Adjusted net income was 1.02 billion or $3.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income rose 11.1% compared to the prior year, to $3.48 billion or $10.43 per share. That reflects excellent underlying profitability and lower catastrophe losses. Returns were also excellent with an adjusted return on equity of 16.9%.","If you turn to Slide 4, Allstate delivered in all of five 2019 operating priorities, which focus on both near term performance and long-term value creation. The first three priorities, better serve customers, grow our customer base and achieve target returns on capital, they are all intertwined in it just to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved at most of our businesses.","Total policies in force reached $145.9 million, which is an increase of 20.7% compared to the prior year. Property liability policies, which are now our bigger dollar amounts, increased by $428,000 for the prior year to $33.7 million as Allstate insurance brands grew 1.3% and 2.3% respectively. Allstate protection plans, which of course, was formerly SquareTrade, continued its rapid growth due to the addition of a major retail partner with items in force reaching $99.6 million.","Returns remain excellent, driven primarily by strong property liability results. The underlying combined ratio of 85 finished 2019 at the favorable end of our revised full year guidance of 84.5 to 86.5. And you\u2019ll remember as part of our second quarter earnings release last year, we had improved this annual outlook range due to excellent operating results.","As you know, Allstate's no longer going to provide underlying combined ratio guidance since return on equity is a better measure of performance, and Mario is going to provide some additional context on this measure. The $88 billion investment portfolio generated $3.2 billion in net investment income in 2019, which reflects higher market base portfolio yields, which was offset by lower performance based results. Performance based results were below expectations for the quarter, but longer term results have been strong.","Total portfolio return was 9.2% in 2019. Shareholder value has also been created by building long-term growth platforms. We announced new features of a transformative growth plan, which we\u2019ll discuss next. Arity continued to expand capabilities. Allstate indemnity protection is growing and launches new digital footprint offering and avail a car sharing platform initiated operations.","You move to Slide 5, let's discuss the transformative growth plan to increase property liability market share. The plan is build on our strengths and reflects current competitive conditions. Allstate has a significant number of competitive strength, as you know, particularly in property liability we have the Allstate brand, we have pricing sophistication, claim expertise, product breadth and a broad distribution platform that goes from Allstate agents to Esurance's direct capabilities to encompasses independent agents. As a result, we're growing but GEICO and Progressive are growing auto insurance market share faster through massive advertising spending and low cost structures.","Our plan also recognizes that customer needs are changing due to increased conductivity and advanced analytics. Our leading positions in telematics and digital auto collision estimates are two examples of how we're embracing these changes. At the same time, a majority of customers prefer Allstate and insurance agent, we hope an Allstate insurance agent, when purchasing a policy, but are comfortable with self service. So we're increasing mobile application capabilities and building low cost centralized integrated service capabilities.","We're now accelerating these efforts with a transformative growth plan, which has three components. Expand customer access, improving the customer value proposition by lowering expenses and redesigning property liability products and investing in technology and marketing.","Standard customer access will be provided by utilizing Esurance\u2019s direct capabilities to sell Allstate branded products. Esurance has strong direct capabilities, having more than doubled in size since it was acquired a little over eight years ago. As a result, we can further leverage these capabilities by selling Allstate branded policies directly to consumers. This will require us to reposition the Allstate brand and the advertising previously deployed for the Esurance brand will be shifted to the Allstate brand and then the Esurance brand will be phased out in late 2020.","Expense reductions will improve affordability, while funding investments in technology and marketing. We'll also strengthen the independent agent platform by merging the Allstate independent agent offering into Encompass. This is a comprehensive plan that will make us a stronger competitor and lead to increased market share.","Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through the property liability and investment results.","Mario Rizzo","Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6, where we highlight strong results within our property liability segment. Policy and premium growth continued and all of the brands had strong underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1 billion in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than the prior year, driven by lower catastrophe losses and the continued improvement in the expense ratio despite increased marketing investments and the write-off of the remaining Esurance acquisition and tangible related to the brand name.","Moving to the table, net written premium increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year, driven by policy and average premium growth in Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance and the Esurance brand. Total policies enforced increased 1.3% to 33.7 million in 2019. Underwriting income of $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year, were substantially higher than the respective prior year periods, driven by continued progress on improving our cost structure, average premium increases and lower catastrophe losses.","The underlying combined ratio shown in the bottom left, which excludes catastrophes prior year reserve estimates and the $51 million pre-tax impairment charge related to our decision to utilize the Allstate brand for direct sales, was 84.9 for the fourth quarter. The 2019 results of 85.0, was at the favorable end of the full year guidance range of 84.5 to 86.5.","Focusing on the table on the bottom right of the page, you can see our recorded combined ratio trend overtime by line of business, as well as total property liability. Auto insurance profitability remained strong with a combined ratio of 92.8, excluding the Esurance impairment, increased average earned premium and lower property damage and bodily injury frequency offset higher severity in 2019.","Property damage severity continues to be impacted by higher costs to repair vehicles, while increase -- which increases the number of total losses. Bodily injury severity increased at a rate above medical inflation indices, but we factor these severity trends into our pricing algorithms. Homeowners insurance continues to generate excellent returns. Lower catastrophe losses were significant in achieving a combined ratio of 88.4 for the year. In total, Allstate has industry leading combined ratios for our property liability businesses.","Let's go to Slide 7, which highlights investment performance for the year and the fourth quarter. Our investment portfolio total return for 2019 was 9.2%. Net investment income contributed 3.7% to total return with a stable contribution from interest income on fixed income investments, but a lower contribution from our performance based portfolio. Higher bond and equity valuation contributed 5.5% to total return in 2019.","The chart at the bottom shows net investment income for the fourth quarter of $689 million, $97 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. Market based investment income shown in blue increased to $735 million and benefited from proactive actions we've taken, including a duration extension in our property liability portfolio. Performance based income shown in gray was lower than recent trend and included lower valuations of $74 million pre-tax on two private equity limited partnerships.","Given the performance based portfolios impact on recorded income, let's turn to Slide 8 to review the purpose, makeup and results of these investments. Our performance based strategy delivers attractive long-term risk adjusted returns and is well suited for long dated liabilities and capital. The strategy diversifies our portfolio through idiosyncratic equity returns that complement our market based strategy.","The portfolio is broadly diversified by asset type, including private equity and real estate, as well as geography, sectors and partners. We invest in funds, co-invest and have direct investments as well. The $8.7 billion portfolio had a one year return through September of 7.6%, and three and five year returns of around 11%. While idiosyncratic investments generate higher returns, they do create income volatility, as you can see on the right.","The portfolio generated $469 million of investment income in 2019, but all of that occurred in the first three quarters. In 2018, the portfolio generated $716 million of investment income and $145 million in the fourth quarter. We continuously monitor the portfolio and do not believe the lower valuations on two private equity investments in the fourth quarter are indicative of the broader portfolio.","Slide 9 highlights results for Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $76 million in the fourth quarter and $261 million for the year. The fourth quarter improved by $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher net investment income and lower operating costs. The full year income of $261 million was 11.5% below 2018 due to the third quarter write down of deferred acquisition costs in connection with the annual actuarial assumption review, which reflected lower interest rates.","Allstate benefits adjusted net income of $16 million in the fourth quarter was $10 million below the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the write-off of acquisition costs related to the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account. For the full year, adjusted net income of $115 million was $9 million below the prior year.","Allstate annuities, shown on the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $33 million in the fourth quarter, driven by lower performance based income. Adjusted net income of $10 million for the full year 2019 was below the prior year, reflecting lower performance based investment income in the first and fourth quarters.","Let's turn to Slide 10. The service businesses continued to grow the number of customers protected with policies in force increasing 42% to $105.9 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate protection plans. Revenues grew 21.9% to $434 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.6 billion for the full year 2019. Adjusted net income was $3 million in the fourth quarter and $38 million for the full year. Adjusted net income increased in 2019 compared to the prior year period as improved loss performance in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services were partially offset by continued growth and integration investments at Allstate identity protection.","Slide 11 highlights the excellent cash returns provided to shareholders. In 2019, we returned $2.5 billion to common shareholders through a combination of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $653 million in common stock dividends. We repurchased 16.4 million or 4.9% of common shares outstanding over the last 12 months and increased our book value per share by more than $15 to $73.12.","The $3 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2018 was completed in late-January 2020. And yesterday, the board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by the end of 2021. We also reduced the cost of capital in 2019 by redeeming multiple series of preferred stock and issued two new series at lower rates, which will reduce preferred dividends by $17 million annually.","Let's move to Slide 12 and discuss our long-term return on equity goal. Starting this year, we will no longer provide annual property liability underlying combined ratio guidance, but instead discuss returns on equity. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, this is a better measure of our performance for multiple reasons.","It is a broader long-term measure of performance than the underlying combined ratio, which focuses on just one part of one of our businesses and excludes significant items, such as investment income, catastrophes and other protection businesses income. It factors in capital management and is more correlated with stock price and it fosters a better comparison with our peers. On a long-term basis, our adjusted net income return on equity goal is 14% to 17%. This range also aligns with executive compensation as discussed in our annual proxy statement.","Now we'll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, you might have your phone on mute.","Elyse Greenspan","So my first question is on your ROE target, the 14% to 17%. Just a couple questions there, if we can get a sense of what you define as the long-term? And then how you see kind of 2020 coming-in in reference to that 14% to 17%? And then my last question on that thought would be, are you going to go into any particular details on the returns that you're charging within that within property liability versus your life related businesses or services?","Mario Rizzo","First, let me deal with the second question first, we're not going to give out a number for 2020, which goes to your first question. Which is when you look at this kind of like rolling three-year basis like over a three-year period cats go up and down, things go up and down and we should be able to earn 14% to 17% return. We got there by really looking at a couple of things versus what's the level of economic rent we can capture by how good we are in a market we operate in. And so as you know in the property liability business, we run a substantially more favorable combined ratio than the industry and that's for a substantial amount of economic return.","We also look at it from what's the appropriate risks -- what's the appropriate return for the risks that our shareholders take, and we feel like 14% to 17% is a good goal for us to have over that three year basis. I don't think you should try to use this to decide what 2020 forecasts are, there\u2019s lot of better ways to do a forecast. We're not going to break it out by component, because our goal here was to get up to the corporate level and say what are we doing in total, because with the underlying combined ratio, we basically zoomed ourselves in including you all into how well was auto insurance doing that we\u2019ve neglected to focus on the other opportunities to do.","Obviously, the 14% to 17% includes a whole bunch of components. So the annuities, as we\u2019ve talked about before, are a large drag on that. So if you were to intuit between the 300%-plus drag that has on ROE to the other businesses, you would say the other businesses are higher return. And of course, most of that is property liability but that will change over time. Obviously, the acquisitions, like purchase of Allstate protection plans, obviously, that business is doing extremely well from our standpoint is well above its acquisition targets, but it does put a drag on ROE. Interest rates would go the other way, particularly in the Property-Liability portfolio. So what we did was stand back and say, what do we think is right over time on kind of a rolling three year basis.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question, you guys rolled out your new growth related optimization efforts in December. Just want to get a sense, as you kind of change your commission structure a little bit. How you envision that playing out in terms of both pick up a new business growth and any kind of drag you see that having on the underlying loss ratio, I guess, specifically to auto book?","Tom Wilson","Well, let me maybe go up for a minute and ask Glenn to talk about the commission changes you're talking about for 2020, which I think the specific ones you're referring. So transformative growth is a multiyear effort we expect it as both expanding customer access, improving customer value and investing in technology and marketing, to help us grow market share. The improving value will be done two ways, one reducing expenses. And that's expenses across the board and we can talk more about that later if you want, but it's really across the board and redesign the property liability projects. Glenn did make some changes to the commission structure for 2020, which he can talk about. ","Glenn Shapiro","Elyse, we've got a few things going to stimulate growth in what is a very competitive environment right now. So we're pleased that we're able to keep growing. And to the second part of your question, deliver returns. So I'll answer that part first. Do we expect it to, as we grow to deteriorate returns? I would say no, because we've evidenced that, we're pretty disciplined about that and we've been -- as we've grown, we've kept our eye on the returns. But the specific actions, one, are you referring to the change in compensation. We move some of the compensation variable comp from agent renewals to new business to incentivize growth. We want to pay folks for growing their business. We're also putting more into advertising and managing our lead management platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.","Greg Peters","My first question will be around the expense ratio improvement that you guys generated in 2019. I think that's probably the biggest surprise, at least from an outside observer perspective. In some of your previous comments, you said there was some benefit for incentive comp. So I guess my question is, around how much of that 90 basis points was sustainable considering the strong results that you posted last year, is that going to boost up the incentive comp for 2020? And then dovetail the expense ratio improvement with what kind of anticipation, or expectation should we have about continuing improvements? So should we factor in some modest improvement every year? I know you guys are rolling out the integrated services platform, et cetera.","Tom Wilson","Greg, let me take it incentive. Mario can talk about expenses. So we said incentive comp targets every year. And so we have two measures, one is -- or 2 programs. One is the annual incentive plan, which is management's compensation program and that\u2019s at every year based on how well we did the year before. So it's not like you get a couple of years. We also have obviously a longer term plan, which is our performance stock rewards, which are tied to return on equity. So those you shouldn't expect fall over from one year to another as it relates to expenses. If we exceed the targets established by the board then obviously, we have to put it into the P&L, but presumably that's because we're making more money than everybody thought.","Mario Rizzo","I just would add a couple things. So first, I think we're continued to be pleased with the progress we're making on expenses. And as Tom talked about earlier, it's a core part of our transformative growth strategy. And one of the ways that we're going to further improve the customer value proposition and create the capacity for the growth investments that he alluded to. So our work in this area is not done. We're going to keep focusing on expenses and look to drive down the expense ratio. One thing I'll add with the fourth quarter specifically, the impairment charge related to the Esurance brand was worth about six tenths of a point on the expense ratio. So if you look year-over-year, you see some real meaningful improvement in the expense ratio in the quarter that gets a little bit masked by that non-recurring charge.","Greg Peters","Mario, is that where the Esurance expense ratios I think, was up 27.5% in the fourth quarter. Is that what you're talking about?","Mario Rizzo","Yes, it\u2019s in the expense ratio, so worth about six tenths to the overall property liability number, obviously, more of an impact to Esurance specifically.","Greg Peters","The second question, I guess, just pivot to the performance based investments. Obviously, it's generated a strong result for you over a long period of time, but there's volatility. And this past year, there was volatility. And for outside observers, can you provide any guidance for us and how we should think about that volatility as we think about 2020, the 2020 outlook?","Tom Wilson","Let me make an overall comment about investments, and John can go to the more color on performance base, recognizing we don't like to give next year's projections out there. We proactively managed our portfolio and John's created and used a really comprehensive capital allocation framework that helps the investment team decide what and when to invest and it keeps track of the decisions we made and not just investments we made but so we can track those, but also any opportunities missed or any losses we avoided. So we watch our money well and it's on all ports of the portfolio. So John can talks about what we do, how we deploy that and performance base and what it means.","John Griek","When you go up and think about the whole portfolio, it helps put performance base in context and why we like it. The portfolio is about $88 billion in size, majority of its invested in high quality fixed income instruments and about 18% of that is equity and roughly half of that is performance base. So just to kind of size it within the overall context. We like performance base because it focuses on private markets and really expands our opportunity set investments that we can play with and allows us to create in our belief a more efficient frontier, a more efficient portfolio that's well suited to our overall liability and capital structure.","What comes with that is increased volatility on income. And we believe that and we expect volatility, we expected it in the past and we\u2019ll expect it going forward. We believe that we're compensated for that volatility of income. In this particular quarter that volatility, especially if you look at it year-over-year on a quarterly basis, the difference was $97 million and about 74 of that was tied to two investments. That obviously was a disappointment but we've gone back in and we recognize that we look at the underlying investments here. They range from timber and agriculture, to real estate, to private equity, to a number of different investments in there. It's hard to pin down with great precision in any given quarter how that's going to play out. So I would expect continued volatility.","We have also gone through, and as part of our regular risk and surveillance processes, looked at all of our holdings as we normally would do and believe that this was not a -- and this was a bit of a one off type of quarter. We remain confident in effort going forward despite this performance in this quarter. We believe we have a strong team. When we look at measuring this, we really look to longer term measures. We look to three, five and 10 year and some of those measures are in the investor supplement, and those tend to be holding true. So we really are changing our overall commitment to it and expect while there may be bumps in the road in any given quarter that long run it's an important part of what we do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. ","Paul Newsome","I was hoping if you just give us a little bit of an update of how you see the current pricing and competitive trend in auto. Obviously, last year was a pretty competitive year but if you think that things are stabilizing industry wide or not, love to hear your thoughts?","Tom Wilson","This is Tom, let me make a couple of overall dramatic conversations and then Glenn can talk about what he's seeing in the market by competitor. But our philosophy has been to for, as you know, profitable growth and long-term profitable growth. So we raise prices when we think we need to when the trends show we should do it and so we don't get behind on it. We're not big in terms of reducing price to try to grow like we, I'd like to say around here, anybody can lose their way to increase market share and that's not our plan.","The other thing I would say is you always have to be careful of the percentages, because it always depends where you start. So we have some competitors who are higher price than us and they're reducing their prices and other carriers who are lower than us and certain risks, and they're raising the prices. So Glenn can talk about the percentages. And there are obviously some overall macro trends at work in auto insurance pricing but I just -- we have to be careful not to be too specific as to what it means for next quarter sales.","Glenn Shapiro","And as Tom said, I think I\u2019ll lead you to one set of numbers that I think tells the story. Our average premium in auto was up 3% year-over-year and our average loss and expense was up 2.5%. So we were disciplined in managing to a positive return and actually made a little progress during a time where, as you said, it was very, very competitive out there. We did see some competitors take sort of broad based rate reductions, which is why the overall CPI is negative, that as Tom said, not a trend we\u2019ll follow or something we subscribe to, we look state-by-state.","To your question about what we're seeing more recently is it stabilizing, I would say, I'll give you the qualified yes, there is a little bit more rate activity starting to flow into the market. You're seeing less price reductions or really no price reductions in the recent past and you see some increases out there. So I\u2019ll call it more stable.","Paul Newsome","Second question, obviously, on the commercial line side of the world, there's a lot of conversation about basically casualty related inflation trends. I recognize that's on a huge part of what you do as an auto and home insurer. But could you talk to whether or not you\u2019re seeing that in the fairly modest pieces that are casualty parts of your business?","Tom Wilson","Paul, are you talking about bodily injury costs that we're assuming\u2026","Paul Newsome","Well, actually I'm thinking more pure liability and home insurance business, for example, flips and falls, and lawsuits, and things of that nature?","Glenn Shapiro","So not seeing much of a trend on the home side on that, our trend set are more meaningful for us on the home side really are the mix between frequency and severity of our property, first party losses. So we're not seeing really anything on home.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","First question is around net premiums written growth. I think it's slowed down a little bit. And I guess in particular you see a little bit of a slowdown in the renewal ratios and then new applications, especially in auto. Can we maybe talk about that and maybe how that ties to the transformative growth plan?","Tom Wilson","First, as I said earlier, it's all about profit growth for us, the transformative growth plan should bring our expense ratio down and enable us to improve our competitive position, which should drive to higher growth in 2019 throughout the other different stories in the Allstate branded business than Esurance business. So Glenn, maybe you can talk about the Allstate branded business. And Esurance for 2019 was still under Steve, now of course under Glenn as part of our transformative growth. But Steve maybe you can pop in on Esurance.","Glenn Shapiro","So I'll start us off. And just at a high level, I\u2019d tell you we feel good about the fact we were able to grow in a really competitive market, as has been pointed out before on the call here, negative CPI, premiums up 5.5%, policies in force grew across all major lines. And it's hard work to do that in a competitive environment. So it's challenging. To your point that moved down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we're still in the upper bounds in that sort of call it the upper third of our long-term trend on both retention and new business. We're coming off the high base here. And we're taking the actions short-term as we build out transformative growth, taking the actions short-term to grow, which I referenced before, of changing agency comp where we're shifting more towards new business, putting more into marketing.","Steve Shebik","So for 2019, insurance had about 8.5% increase in net return premium. So for the year, it feels good but that trend declined throughout the year and the fourth quarter was only 2.6%. And we did, as you know, we grew fairly rapidly last year also. And so we have that new business penalty and in some states, we took some fairly significant rates more in the second half of the year. So that really slowed down our growth as we went into the third and fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about the growth we had, we feel good with where the business is positioned going forward but we have to be probable.","Yaron Kinar","And then my second question just goes back to the ROE guidance range for the next three years. I guess what would be the largest components that would drive ROE to the upper end of that range or the lower end of that range? And does that range also contemplate the possibility of this disposition of the annuity business?","Tom Wilson","I would say there's a number of components here, there's what\u2019s your -- the obvious piece is, what's your combined ratio and underwriting income that's impacted by what your underlying is also what catastrophes are, which as you know bounce around. There's what happens to investment income and we've talked about that today. There's also the amount of equity you have at play and so, we've been building equity but we're still buying shares back, so that has an impact.","As it related to the future, this is kind of an is business model approach. We didn't assume anything was going to change as mentioned to Elyse is that things will change in the future, but we still feel like 14% to 17% is the right range. But lots of stuff could change, the interest rates could go up and interest rates go up, for the Property-Liability business, most of that income falls right through the bottom line. And if you look at our investment income over a long period of time, we are down substantially. Now we've made that up by reducing the combined ratio and improving underwriting income, but that will change over time. Obviously the annuities business will be a positive. To extent we decided to invest in growth in an acquisition, that would be a negative. So we felt like in total the 14% to 17% was a good goal for us, but it changes as the world changes then we'll let people know. But it's a three year kind of rolling average for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.","David Motemaden","Just a follow-up on the transformative growth plan and just trying to get some sense for when you think we should start to see the benefits of those changes start to roll through in terms of more competitive product and then an uptick in new applications, better retention and higher PIF growth after we've seen a bit of a deceleration in all those metrics?","Tom Wilson","David, first, it's a long-term plan. This is going to take us multiple years to do. But there's obviously components of it and some parts will have a bigger impact early and other parts will have a larger impact later in the game. So we expect early in the plan that expense reductions will play a significant role in us improving our affordability for customers, and getting to that second part of improving the value proposition.","As you go forward, we would expect that redesigning our technology -- our property liability products will drive more differentiation. So we were first to market with decline the deductibles, first to market with new car replacement. There are other ideas and things we have in place that we think can drive more value, but it's going to take more time to put those into the marketplace. So those in terms of improving the customer value proposition, expenses first redesign products later.","The redesign products is later is in part it requires a new technology platform, which is the third piece. We have to invest more in the new technology platforms, particularly our product management platform and our customer experience layer. So that will take us a while to do. We think we can still cut expenses and reduce the overall expense but why we are investing in those and that's our goal. But at the same time, we're going to invest more in marketing earlier in the process, because we believe that will drive growth. And Glenn talked about what he is doing to enhance the Allstate agent value proposition, whether that's increasing new business commissions, or freeing them up by taking low value work out of their offices and putting it into integrated service.","The other piece is to expand the access, and that's happening as we speak. So the access to people who called for the Allstate brand who got on to our Web site in Allstate brand, had some restricted rules on it, which we've started to open those up now. So for example, if you called during working hours, you could get a different experience and if you called after working hours, you should have the same experience. Like you're getting online, it shouldn't matter what time of day you do that.","So we're changing those rules. What Glenn is also doing is taking the Esurance capabilities, which are exceptionally good in direct. He's putting those together with the Allstate branded capabilities, which do some direct today. And that will then be utilized for the Allstate brand that will take us some time to do. One obviously, you\u2019ve got to put all the operations together, and call centers and get the technology to work the same and get the order -- the flow on the Web site, all to be the same.","We also need to reposition the Allstate brand. And so the Allstate brand, of course, is extremely well-known, great unaided awareness, high trust marks, people \u2013 it\u2019s one of the great brands of the world and that said, it's not viewed as modern as Esurance is. So Esurance built for the modern world, a little hit a little cleaner. So we are working hard on reposition the Allstate brand so that it brings both of those together so that we both serve our customers with agents when they want them and we serve them direct when they want. So it's a long-term plan but you can see there's -- its front end loaded on some parts and back end loaded on others.","David Motemaden","And just with the customer value proposition and some of the increases in the bodily injury severity that popped above CPI, medical CPI, this quarter, which is the first time I think in a bit it has. Have you, I mean, is that already embedded in your pricing? Or is that something that would I guess go the other way against some of these expense saves that maybe able to pass through more competitive rate?","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, I'll take that. This is Glenn. And yes, we've seen some of the trends come through that you've heard about from others on bodily injury. It is embedded in our reserve position that we have where we think through these things, as we set our reserves, as we set our pricing strategy. As you've seen over the last couple of years where we've run hot on physical damage severity and yet really hasn't flowed through to the margins, because we're pretty quick at adapting from a pricing standpoint and on a market-by-market basis.","So I would tell you we\u2019re watching it, we've got good process. We have a great claims department that looks it, both the technology and the process that they followed to handle claims. And where it goes beyond what claims can manage whereas they're paying claims accurately, we get it into pricing quickly.","David Motemaden","And then if I could just speak one last one in, just in terms of the high-end of the ROE guide. And I guess just thinking about potentially like there have been a few transactions in the fourth quarter on the life side, and it seems like there's a pretty vibrant interest, a lot of interest in some of these run off books of annuities or life insurance. Just wondering -- and in Illinois, I believe there's a division of company rule that can allow you to carve out specific reserves out of that Illinois legal entity and divest to a potential acquirer. So just sort of wanted to get an update on your view in terms of, your thinking in terms of like whether you see any opportunities there to potentially reinsure or digest that book and maybe get to a more sustainable high-end of that ROE guide given it has like a 300 bp drag on the ROE?","Glenn Shapiro","It is a third question, but this is different than the other ones, I will take. But I also -- let's try to -- there are other people in the house. The answer is, we've been trying to -- we've been working on annuities for a whole bunch of years trying to get it better. We made a lot of progress to extent there is something else we can do it, where it\u2019s use the division statute to get a different solution reinsured. If we can do it in a way that is economic for our shareholders and has a good risk adjusted return, we'll do that. And if we do that, I don't think anybody would be unhappy if we were -- if you looked at, if we were above the upper end of the guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. ","Amit Kumar","Actually two quick follow-up questions, the first I guess is in response to the previous question on the shift in the plan, the new plan. Can you give us any early sort of feedback from agents? Number one on the integrated services platform, and number two, also, what is the feedback on shifting the bonus and\/or the commission structure from existing and new businesses?","Tom Wilson","I mean I think we got it. We were all leaning in towards the steep curve to make sure I heard it was a low light. So I think Glenn can talk about the integrated service and commissions. Maybe let me go back to transformative growth and make comment really on behalf of the customer. So the agents are part of our team. We want them to be successful. We're leaning in hard to make them successful. They drive a bunch of our business and we're going to work hard at making them successful. That said, there's a range of opinions as to what people think about what you're doing.","But let me come back to the customer. What we are trying to do with transformative growth is stick with our customer philosophies. And one of our philosophies is you should pay a fair price for the risks you create. We're very sophisticated in the way we do pricing. We get telematics, which is the new end of it with Drivewise. We also have a philosophy that customers should get what they pay for. And as it relates to the auto insurance same things apply.","So if you get extra service then you should -- and extra advice from the help of an agent, there should be something you should be prepared to pay extra for. If you want to do all stuff yourself then that's something that's a different price value proposition. So we are working hard to make sure that that agent value proposition is as effective and efficient as it can be. Like people as we said, I think we said when we talked about this, that over half the people want an agent and it's higher as it reflects our customer base. So we want to help them be as successful as they can and that's why Glenn is working on the couple of programs he is.","Glenn Shapiro","Yes, I'll just add to it. We talked to our agency force all the time talking to agents every week. We've got national advisory council, regional boards. We spend a lot of time with our agency force. And I\u2019ll give you the range of reactions. So on the -- overall, the facing out of transformative growth, we're going to pull the marketing in from Esurance as the Allstate brand, as you might imagine wildly popular. Like everybody feels really good about the fact that there's going to be more marketing in the pipeline and we're focusing on the Allstate brand.","On the commission change, you got folks that they were growing fast and they're built to grow. They liked it a lot, because that leads right into their strength. You got folks that really weren't growing or weren't built to grow, you have a range of folks who are either excited about making that transition and retooling their business, or ones that say I wasn't really ready to retool my business. But they need to in order to earn the commission that goes with the new business, the higher new business commission.","As it goes to integrated service, as Tom said, lots of different opinions out there. It really is about freeing people up for growth. And what I can tell you is the folks that are in it are growing faster than the folks that aren't. So we think we're creating something that's going to be really valuable for the agency force.","Tom Wilson","So if you go back to the customer and what blends higher new business when you ask customers, where does an agent add the most value, it's almost always on either the purchase of the product are doing an insurance review, helping me sort out stuff, very little of is on changing address. And so that's what Glenn's working on.","Amit Kumar","And very quickly on the lost cost trend, I know you briefly talked about it. But net-net, can you talk about either when you look at the frequency and severity trends. Is the expectation that this is how it sort of remains for the foreseeable future, or what\u2019s your outlook on the loss cost trends here?","Glenn Shapiro","So I'll take that. This is Glenn. Let me go up a little bit, because I think if you look at the whole system and you say, there's premiums that come in and how we may changes to those overtime to these expenses that are going out the door, and then you split your loss costs by frequency and severity.","Over the past year, three out of those four have been going well for us. Our premium, as I mentioned, autos up 3%, average premium -- home is up 5% average premium, the respective loss and expense on those lines are 2.5 and 4. So we've made up a half a point and a full point in terms of actually improving over the time period. So it's hard for me to say, I can't predict that severity will be flattening or up more over a year, two years from now. But what I can tell you is we've been really disciplined about managing it quickly into each market on a market-by-market basis. Our pricing sophistication, our state management team, has gotten better and better and we're able to react in real time to those changes and manage to the types of returns that we've been able to deliver. So while I can't give you a perfect prediction on where the severities will go, I feel really good about our ability to react to it in real time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","Couple for Glenn. So Tom mentioned it over half of Allstate branded customers one in Asia, I thought that was interesting. In terms of just like the pathway of becoming an Allstate brand customer, what percentage of people I guess start on the Internet, Google insurance or something like that. And is that the lead generation mechanism, I guess just digital or the Internet versus an Allstate agent as a little league coach or something like that?","Tom Wilson","Ryan, Glenn can give you through some of the percentages we give out but this is not and\/or conversation. A lot of times people are like, well, they want to buy direct or through an agent. It's an and. Like, we'll sell to people anyway they want. You want to start online, buy from the agent, call an agent buy online, like we're just there to. Like, we want to sell as much as we can to as many people as we can through as many ways as we can.","Glenn Shapiro","It's a challenging question, I'll tell you, because there's a lot of stops in the process where for example, people go online, they start to get a quote and the agency that's nearest to them pops up with that quote and they decide to drop off, make the phone call and that's one path, there's multiple paths people take through. The vast majority of our business is written by a local agent. That said, all the data and research out there tells you that the vast majority of people start their process online and at least get some understanding and then want to talk to somebody about it. So we've got a mix of that and imperfect data for me to give you any more specifics on that.","Ryan Tunis","And then I was hoping if you could give us a bit of a peak on some of these new product initiatives. I guess, in particular, I'm trying to understand the price sensitivity or whatever. I mean, obviously, your captive agent. Are you thinking new business pricing down 10% or something like that? I'm just trying to understand like, how much of a driver do you think that is for potential new issued applications?","Tom Wilson","I am not sure we understood the question. We're not --maybe you could rephrase it.","Ryan Tunis","So I'll ask it this way. Like two three years ago, travelers who's obviously an independent agent player, they just announced that they were cutting new business prices by 10%. I could see how that could have more of an impact, and like an agency distribution channel versus a captive. I'm wondering if that\u2019s how you see it as well or if you think that -- am I missing something or is there a similar level of price elasticity in captive is what you might see in agent, like could that be a big driver for growth.","Tom Wilson","Let me maybe start with the last piece and work my way up, and anybody else wants to jump in. So first, it's of course always hard to tell how much price elasticity is within an agency. In general, you would think that an agency that had multiple companies and could share those multiple quotes for you there would be more price elasticity than in a captive agent. That said people can call around the three or four people and get their points of view. So auto insurance in particular is price sensitive. Although, we've talked at length us trying to have profitable growth, I guess what we're trying to do.","The redesign of the products is on all of our products, auto, home, and a variety of different products where there are things we think we can do to make them less complicated. And so for example, this year, we rewrote the renter's policy in one state and took its size down by 40%. That gets to less complexity, helping customers understand it, so we're doing the proper. But we also have a variety of other products in the circle, protection we're trying to get to. So we don't sell identity protection today through our Allstate agents.","Make sense that we have customers that come to Allstate agents, probably would like to get their identity protected. How do we do that? How do we get the systems to work? How do we get the technology platform do it, how it\u2019s factored into compensation and everything else? It\u2019s something we're working and that\u2019s part of transformative growth on a longer basis. So we have many products we sell through many channels but we don't sell all of our products through all of our channels. And that's part of transformative, because it\u2019s how do we sell more of what we sell already in more of the places that we sell.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks.","Tom Wilson","We probably have time for one more question. How about one more question.","Operator","Our final question then for today comes from the line Michael Zaremski from Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","First question if -- the P&C investment portfolio, the duration has increased fairly measurably over the last few years and up to five plus years now just curious as you continue to see that elongating. Are you kind of at the high end of your kind of the range you're comfortable with versus kind of duration of liabilities?","John Griek","Mike, it's John. Look, you never know exactly what the future holds. So we're always going to respond to economic conditions, overall risk and environment of our firm and structure of the portfolio that way. I would say that what we've seen in terms of the duration extension in recent time and a lot of that's taken place in the last 18 months was more of a reaction back to strategic norm.","As interest rates had been rising prior to that with the cycle that the fed was in, we thought that it was prudent to stay a little bit short and look to recapture higher yields that are better -- when there's a better opportunity. We couple that with a little bit, if you go back 18 to 24 months so the economic situation in the U.S. in the world was different. It was software at that time and it wasn't clear that policymakers were going to engage, they\u2019re in a tightening cycle.","We thought that they needed to engage, we also wanted to put a little bit of inflation protector or recession protection back in the portfolio, when you have more duration. If the economy falls off, it tends to help your portfolio and balance it out more. So we did actively highly coordinated internally with all our risk processes, extend the duration.","It had a number of benefits that we're pleased with. It did increase income, which is a positive. It also did build in a more balanced portfolio, balance at our risk based assets. And if you look at --this isn't perfect math, but if you look back at where rates were when we did most of extension relative to where they are today, it's been a great price increase in our fixed income securities. Rates are roughly market yields when you include where treasuries were and where corporate are roughly about 100 basis points lower than that time.","So going forward, we'll continue to monitor. What I can assure you is that it will be highly coordinated inside. Tom talked earlier about our numerous processes, our capital allocation process with investments. We also work very closely with our enterprise risk group to make sure that these are -- all our moves are well understood. And we believe that proactive management investment portfolio is a way to add value to the enterprise.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, that's helpful. And yes, definitely it's been a great call. Lastly clearly, a lot of questions about the new commission structure. Maybe curious, has policy growth --is it more and more weighted towards maybe a disproportionately smaller percentage of agencies? Is that changed over the years? I know commission structure did change a number of years ago too, and it seems like it worked out okay, as sales didn't fall apart. Maybe you could add any color that'd be great.","Tom Wilson","I mean, what our strategy is to have all of our agents growing and all of them be productive. As you point out, not all of them get there every year. Sometimes that's what we do in a local market or what the local market conditions. Some of that's what they do or they don't do. So we don't -- this commission change wasn't to address a problem. It was to seize an opportunity. And I think commission is -- we move commissions around frequently, like it's not -- it happens all the time, people do it now all the businesses are in and our goal is to make sure that their objectives are aligned with our objectives.","Thank you all for -- let me just close by saying thank you. We had a good 2019. We're focused on transformers growth in 2020. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"1501":["The Allstate Corp.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After our prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday, following the close of the market, we filed the 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the news release, investor supplement, and today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results.","As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Good morning. Thank you for joining to stay current on Allstate's operating results.","Let's begin on slide 2, so the headline year is Allstate's businesses continued to deliver growth and attractive returns. Our strategy is working. We're on pace to achieve our five 2018 operating priorities.","At the Property-Liability, year-to-date underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the annual outlook range or for nine months for a close to the bottom of the annual outlook, which is good, as you know. The net result was excellent financial results. We also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, of which up to $1 billion may be funded with perpetual preferred stock.","To go to the table, revenues increased to $10.5 billion, almost $600 million above the prior year quarter. Net income was $833 million in the third quarter of 2018 and adjusted net income per share was $1.93 million, which is 20.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Net income return on equity for the latest 12 months was 17.4% and 15.9% on an adjusted net income basis.","Now, let's start on a more macro perspective before we dig into the details. So if you go to slide 3, Allstate's strategy is to grow market share in the personal Property-Liability businesses while expanding our other protection businesses. So, to start with the upper oval, the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and we serve each of these with a differentiated branded product offering. So Allstate agencies provide customers with personal guidance through 38,000 professionals and over 10,000 agencies in nearly every community in America.","The Esurance on the other hand provides over 1.6 million policies to customers who prefer to purchase their products online or through a call center. We use this sophisticated analytics across all these businesses to ensure we grow profitability and are at the forefront to using telematics-based offerings. We're building an integrated digital enterprise that uses data analytics technology and process redesign to improve both our effectiveness and our efficiency. For example, we are a leader in using consumer generated \u2013 or customer generated photos to quickly settle auto insurance claims.","Our strategy also includes expanding other protection businesses by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution and capital, which are listed in the lower oval and that obviously began in 1957 with life insurance. In 1999, we acquired Allstate Benefits, which provides protection product such as life and disability insurance to employees at the work site. And by leveraging our resources, this business has had a compound annual growth rate of 7% for 18 years.","We purchased SquareTrade at the beginning of 2017 and it's growing rapidly and achieving our acquisition objectives. And this year, we also began offering insurance to transportation networks companies such as through Allstate business insurance. And we recently closed the acquisition of InfoArmor, which further expands our portfolio of person identity protection products and services.","So, this two part strategy then creates shareholder value in a number of different ways through customer satisfaction, unit growth, attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.","So, if you turn to slide 4 then as to what we're doing in 2018, the operating priorities we communicate to you and to our employees and teammates. The first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base. They're intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth.","So, customers were better served as the Net Promoter Score improved across all of our major business. Higher customer retention then at Allstate, Esurance and Encompass, as Property-Liability businesses is driving growth.","Our returns remain excellent. The Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 94.3 generated $473 million of underwriting income for the quarter. Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits generated adjusted net income returns on capital of 12.4% and 14.9%, respectively. The overall adjusted net income return on equity was 15.9% for the latest 12 months.","The growth increase as the \u2013 as Allstate and Esurance, Property-Liability brands grew policies in force as a result of the higher retention I just mentioned and increased new business. Allstate Benefits continued its long track record of growth with policies in force increasing 5.1% over the prior year quarter. SquareTrade added 18.1 million policies over the last 12 months. The $84 billion investment portfolio generated $844 million of net investment income in the third quarter with a total return of 1.1%.","Well, we made good progress building long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade continued to deliver on the success measures we established at acquisition. And the $525 million purchase of InfoArmor will accelerate our expansion into new protection category.","The connected car strategies are also gaining momentum with increased utilization of telematics in the Allstate and Esurance, auto insurance businesses. In addition, Arity has substantially expanded its data collection and now has over 55 billion miles of data, which is growing at almost 9 billion miles per month.","Slide 5 provides more information on InfoArmor for those of you who were not able to tie into our call on that. The InfoArmor acquisition closed on October 5 and accelerates our expansion identity protection. What it does? It provides identity protection products, primarily through voluntary employee benefits channel, which has very attractive acquisition economics.","And in an increasingly connected world, customers' needs for these products are expected to grow rapidly and this positions us with a much broader product offering. There are also excellent expansion opportunities used in the Allstate Benefits platform.","As we've done with other acquisitions, we've established the measures of success. So it both directs our operating priorities and gives us the basis for conversation with you, so InfoArmor is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the voluntary benefits channel including leveraging the Allstate Benefits platform.","Long-term success will also require expanding the product offering and broadening distribution. And lastly, the acquisition should be accretive to adjusted net income by 2021.","John will now go through our Property-Liability results in more detail.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Tom. On slide 6, you can see that Property-Liability results remain strong. Net written premium increased 5.9% in the third quarter, driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. The recorded combined ratio of 94.3 was 0.4 points higher than the third quarter of 2017 due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in homeowners, increased growth-related expenses and small net unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates versus a large positive benefit in the prior-year quarter. This was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and improved auto insurance accident frequency.","Unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates of $12 million reflected $113 million in favorable re-estimates for Allstate Protection auto and homeowners insurance, which was more than offset by $42 million of adverse development in commercial auto for policies written in 2015 and 2016, and an $80 million increase in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves based on our annual review.","The three year survival ratio for asbestos, environmental and other is 10.2 as of September 30, 2018. Non-catastrophe prior year reserve changes for the first nine months of 2018 increased underwriting income by $178 million versus a positive impact of $312 million for the same period in 2017. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates, was 86.6 for the third quarter of 2018. This was 2 points above the prior year quarter.","As you know, our underlying combined ratio guidance is for the full year, and for the first nine months of the year, the underlying combined ratio was 85.4, at the favorable end of the annual outlook range of 85 to 87. For the first nine months of 2018, the underlying combined ratio increased 0.8 compared to the prior year.","Slide 7 covers operating results for Allstate brand auto insurance, where policies in force increased and margins were similar to last quarter. Starting with the bottom left chart, policies in force grew by nearly 400,000 or 2% in the third quarter of 2018. The renewal ratio of 88.7 was an improvement of 1 point from the prior year quarter, benefiting from our focus on improving the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter, increasing 16% compared to the third quarter of 2017.","As you can see in the right-hand box, the recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 92.9, 1.8 points better than the prior year quarter and generated $368 million in underwriting income. This includes over $90 million in favorable prior year reserve re-estimates in the third quarter.","The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average earned premium, lower catastrophe losses and a broad-based decline in accident frequency, partially offset by higher claims severity, particularly in the property damage coverage. Claims severities have been slightly above general inflation trends as more sophisticated cars increased both repair costs and the number of total losses.","The underlying combined ratio of 92.5 in the third quarter of 2018 included an underlying loss ratio of 66.8 and was in line with the second quarter performance, as accident frequency trends remained favorable.","Slide 8 covers Allstate brand homeowners insurance results, which continued to generate attractive returns. Starting in the bottom left, policies in force grew 1.2% compared to the prior year, as both the renewal ratio and new issued applications increased.","The bottom right chart provides detail on profitability. The homeowners insurance recorded combined ratio was 88 in the third quarter. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period, given weather seasonality and variability.","Allstate brand homeowners insurance generated $826 million of underwriting income with a recorded combined ratio of 88.1 over the last 12 months. The underlying combined ratio of 65.4 in the third quarter of 2018 was slightly above our target and was primarily driven by adverse non-catastrophe weather-related losses.","Slide 9 provides financial highlights for Esurance and Encompass. Esurance continued to accelerate growth while improving underlying profitability in the quarter. Esurance net written premium grew 14.6% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects increased average premium in auto and homeowners insurance and a 7.4% increase in total policies in force due to higher retention and new issued applications in auto insurance. The increase in new issued applications is partially due to additional marketing spend in the third quarter.","Homeowners net written premium grew 25% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an increased focus on a multi-line product offering. The recorded combined ratio of 102.1 in the third quarter was 2.3 points better than the prior year quarter, as shown on the upper right, due to the improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. The underlying combined ratio of 99.2 was 1.3 points better than the prior year quarter, as both auto and homeowners insurance results improved.","At the bottom, Encompass net written premium in the quarter was in line with third quarter 2017 as the increase in auto and homeowner insurance average premium was offset by an 8% decline in policies in force. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 96.1 in the third quarter of 2018 with 6.9 points higher than the prior year, partially driven by increased catastrophe losses of $23 million in the quarter.","The underlying combined ratio of 89 for the third quarter was 3.5 points higher than 2017's third quarter. This was due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in homeowners insurance and an increased expense ratio.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mario.","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, John. We've expanded the section on Service Businesses since their strategic and economic value can get overshadowed by the Property-Liability businesses.","Slide 10 highlights the results and measures of success for SquareTrade and Arity. SquareTrade made progress on the three objectives, supporting its acquisition as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved and the business is expanding beyond U.S. retail.","SquareTrade written premium increased 86.5% to $194 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to the continued growth in U.S. retail, as SquareTrade became the exclusive protection plan provider for a leading U.S. retailer during the quarter. Revenues were $128 million and adjusted net income was $7 million in the third quarter.","Arity continues to invest in advancing our telematics platform by providing device and mobile data collection services and analytical solutions to both Allstate affiliated insurance operations and third parties. In the third quarter, Arity had revenues of $22 million, primarily related to affiliate contracts.","Active telematics connections increased to 9.6 million, led by the addition of Life360, the world's largest family driving network. Life360's millions of global users better understand their driving behavior and receive personalized insurance offers from utilization of Arity's software development kit.","As a result, total miles collected reached 55 billion, which is now increasing at a rate of almost 9 billion miles per month. This additional data enables Arity to provide better insurance risk scores for a broader group of drivers.","Slide 11 provides detail for Allstate Dealer Services and Allstate Roadside Services. Allstate Dealer Services provides vehicle financing GAP coverage and vehicle service contracts. It is primarily distributed through auto dealerships.","Revenues were $102 million for the quarter and $298 million for nine months. Adjusted net income was $3 million in the third quarter of 2018, benefiting from profit improvement initiatives and improved profitability of the GAP product offering.","Allstate Roadside Services provides roadside assistance to Allstate customers and through white label arrangements with third parties such as car manufacturers. It is focused on enhancing the customer experience by providing fast and dependable service using the blended traditional and crowd-sourced rescue network optimized through analytics and mobile technology.","Revenues were $77 million for the quarter and are slightly down from the prior year quarter. Expenses associated with the provider networks and technology contributed to a decline in income compared to the prior year quarter.","Turning to slide 12, let's review Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life generated adjusted net income of $74 million in the third quarter, shown on the bottom left chart. This was due to a lower effective tax rate, higher premiums and increased net investment income.","Allstate Benefits adjusted net income, shown in the middle chart on the page, was $32 million in the quarter. The $4 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums and a lower effective tax rate.","Allstate Annuities on the right had adjusted net income of $20 million in the quarter, which was $35 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to lower performance-based investment results compared to a very strong prior year quarter. Adjusted net income return on equity remained low due to the relatively high regulatory capital requirements.","Slide 13 highlights our investment results. The investment portfolio is proactively managed based on relevant market conditions and corporate risk appetite to optimize return per unit of risk.","The chart at the lower left of the slide shows net investment income for the third quarter was $844 million, which was flat for the third quarter of 2017. Market-based investment income shown in blue increased slightly and reflects higher purchase yields and a modest duration extension for the fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a reduced allocation to high-yield bonds.","Performance-based investment income shown in gray generated $214 million of income in the third quarter, a decrease of 6% over strong prior year quarter, primarily reflecting more moderate asset appreciation. Our performance-based investments, which have increased over the last few years, now total $8 billion to almost 10% of the total portfolio.","The components of total return are shown in the table on the lower right. The positive 1.1% return in the quarter was supported by a stable contribution from income shown in blue and positive equity valuations shown in red. Those were slightly offset by lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields shown in gray. The 12-month trailing return for the period was 2.1%.","Slide 14 provides an overview of returns and capital. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income return on equity, shown in the bottom left chart, was 15.9% for the 12 months ended September 30, an increase of 2 points compared to the prior year period.","Book value per share increased to $60.79 or 9.2% since the third quarter of 2017, as higher earnings and a 4.1% reduction in shares outstanding offset the impact of dividends, share repurchases and a decline in fixed-income on realized gains and losses.","Our capital position remains strong and we returned $385 million to common shareholders in the third quarter, bringing the total cash return to shareholders for the first nine months to $1.6 billion, as you can see in the bottom right chart.","We continue to proactively manage our capital. Yesterday, the board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to conclude by the end of April 2020. The new program may be funded by potential preferred stock issuances of up to $1 billion.","Additionally, we closed on the acquisition of InfoArmor on October 5 for $525 million and redeemed $385 million of our preferred shares on October 5.","Now, we'll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My first question, you guys saw higher non-cat weather losses in your homeowers book both in Allstate brand and in Encompass. Can you just talk through what you think was causing that in the quarter? And kind of the outlook there, do you think that that's something that you expect to continue or are you going to take more price in the business or what's the outlook, I guess, for the margins for the homeowners business that we should think about in the fourth quarter and beyond?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Elyse, thanks for the question. It's obviously something we've looked at. I'll give you just a quick overview and then Glenn can take you through the specifics of the quarter. The homeowners business continues to generate really attractive returns for us. So, 88 combined ratio, $574 million of underwriting income over the last 12 months. Obviously, amounts move in between various categories, whether that's catastrophes or other related losses, and you have a lot of volatility embedded deep in homeowners. The net of all that, though, is we're very comfortable with the business and to the extent we have to raise price in various states, we will do that. Glenn can talk about the specific of the quarter.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, I'll just add on that. It's interesting if you look at the weather patterns for the year and we mentioned in the last quarter that we were at the upper end of our underlying target that we have for homeowner and then we went a little bit above that this quarter. There is some shift between catastrophe, non-catastrophe losses. If you look at the overall weather events, we got a similar number of weather events during the year, but more of them are not triggering a catastrophe rating and few of them are triggering catastrophe. We see there's some shift between those.","Said another way and put kind of simply, we got more rain and less hail this year. And as an overall result, we produced like in the quarter an 88 combined ratio, which is pretty favorable, but we see some shift between those numbers. It is something we're keeping an eye on. We do have areas of the country, as you know, we take rate views state-by-state, we have areas that we do have need and we are moving on those needs for rate in those local markets, but broadly we feel, as Tom said, very comfortable with our overall profitability in homeowners.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then my second question on your auto business. Within the Allstate brands, you guys have been taking less rate as you really \u2013 testament you've been able to really improve the margins of that business. And so, as we start to think about potentially \u2013 and you saw higher severity in the quarter and still beneficial frequency, but it seems like that's not necessarily expected to continue, do you think we're still in an environment where your rates can more or less, say, stable as you pursue growth? Or do you see maybe a higher severity trends having an impact on your rating levels from here?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Elyse, I would answer that. We don't really project what the rates will be. We react to what cost and trends are and so we're adjusting as necessary. And we're getting a really good return in the auto business today, we like that returns and so we're growing the business. So, we're comfortable with the overall profitability. And as whether frequency doesn't continue, go down or severity goes up a little more, we factor all of that in. As you know, the paid numbers that you see in the supplement are up this quarter, but that's really only one little component we use to establish profitability and we feel good about the results that we have.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please?","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I sort of want to build on Elyse's question. And first of all, we have to recognize that you are indeed achieving targeted returns across your business, but I was looking at page 3 of your press release, and specifically the chart where you talk about the underlying combined ratios and it looks like in five of the seven categories on an underlying basis you're reporting an uptick not only in the third quarter 2018 but also on the nine-month basis.","And so, as we think about the future for Allstate, analysts are always focused on the sustainability of your current results, and so perhaps you could provide us a perspective on how you see these trends and what we should be thinking about going forward?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sure, Greg. Let me answer it in a couple of different ways. First, we feel very good about the returns we're getting in the business and that the results this year are in line with what we expected. So, as you know, we don't give earnings guidance, but as a result of that, you all have to make estimates. To help you do that, we give you an underlying combined ratio, but that's only one part of the picture. And then, what we do is give you a whole bunch of detailed information under that to enable you to even make a more specific pick. And I think in some ways that it's necessary, we believe we need to be fully transparent, but in another ways we can kind of sometimes drag it down into the micro.","So, your question is really about the macro. And when you look at the auto insurance business, so the combined ratio of 93, that's a 7 point pre-tax margin. In addition, given the timing of the claim payouts, you get a little investment income on top of that. When your premium to surplus ratio can run above 3 to 1, you can do the math relatively quickly and on an after tax basis, that's a really high return on capital at 93 or any other number. And so we're about creating shareholder value. We feel good about that. The components change over time and that's both within a line and then, as you point out, across the line. That's why we give you an underlying combined ratio for the whole company. But the bottom line is, all that is very good. There are things that happened that you see in the numbers that I'm sure caused you some issues.","So when you look at the paid severity, for example, on property damage, that's up, and we're watching up, what I would tell you is that's just one component that's paid. We don't actually book to pays. We book to what we think the number will be. That then helped to us, but we're actually booking at a slightly higher level than you would see in paid because property damage is only 12% of premiums anyway. So, by giving you that information, what I can tell you is we feel good about the profitability of auto insurance. We feel good about its outlook going forward and we've shown an ability over time to adjust and get attractive returns on capital. Not included in that, sometimes when you're looking forward, what are the positive that don't show up in that investor supplement, in higher interest rates should help raise that investment component for auto insurance going forward. So, we feel good about our ability to generate a good return from the auto business.","The homeowner business is slightly different, and it really does build on Elyse's question, which is \u2013 so we have a 12 point margin in homeowners insurance. You don't get as much investment income because obviously you pay the claims out a lot faster, but \u2013 and it requires a little higher capital. That said, with the margin that's 5 points higher than auto insurance, it still also generates a really attractive return on capital and we feel good about that business. And while it bounces around a lot between the components, which we show you and you see and we talk about because we have \u2013 we benefit from a lot of \u2013 from little turnover in our analyst core and you know auto business really well, so as a result of that, sometimes we get dragged down into the micro pieces that I would say, let's come up a little bit. And that's a really high return on capital in the homeowners business.","And I would point out is, over the last year, it's 13 points higher, the margin, which then a big competitor of ours who is growing quite rapidly and everybody is excited about, and we're like, well, like you should be excited if you're growing a business that's making a good return, not for sure, if you're not making a great return. So we feel good about our current returns, we feel good about our competitive position and we expect to stay there going forward.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you for that thoughtful answer. As a follow, maybe just drill down on the difference between new issued application growth and PIF count growth. And it looks both Esurance and Allstate in the autos components that you're booking some really nice gains on new issued applications, but the PIF count growth is a little bit slower, and perhaps you could spend a minute and help us reconcile those different trends.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, this is Glenn. I'll answer for Allstate. We like where we are from a growth perspective and it kind of ties into your last question, Tom's answer too, because what gets lost when we're talking about the returns and everything is we're getting more competitive as this moves in and we are winning in the marketplace.","So when you look at the year-over-year growth, whether it's the 2% in auto or the 1.2% in home, both of those are being driven right now about 60% by retention. So we're keeping customers that we fought hard to attract in the first place. And about 40% of it is being driven by the increase in applications that you refer.","So it's actually a heavier drift from the retention component. But the new business coming in, very favorable as well and it's a result of us being more competitive. I'm not sure if that split answers your question, but that's where we're seeing it come from.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So if you look it on an Encompass perspective, we're growing our new business off a very low base. We took a lot of strong actions in order to right size the business given profitability and shrunk the business. So now, we have over half the states in the country and a little under half of our premium in those states are now in a growth mode. We're trying to balance profitability and growth. And we're still trying to manage profitability in half the country.","In terms of PIF, obviously, we're still going down, but we're going down a lesser rate now, so we feel good on...","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","You're talking about Encompass.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Encompass.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. Okay. I thought he asked about Esurance.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Oh, I'm sorry.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's okay. You can keep going on Encompass and then hit...","(33:13)","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I got too many Es. So Encompass, obviously, if you look at the premium is now stabilized. We're still going down in (33:22). We think that that is slowly getting better as that decline is being reduced. So from Esurance perspective obviously, we're having really good results. We have, as you noted, new business is going up quite high. It's very similar to Allstate. Our retention has done very well for us, which is driving a fair amount of that growth, but we're also, because of new advertising campaign and we think a strong price competitiveness in the marketplace, we are situated very well to continue grow that business.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That is helpful. Maybe you could just spend a minute, and just as a follow-up and just comment on the commercial lines because I think that's where the alliance with Uber is coming in, et cetera?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. So if you look at commercial lines, virtually all of the increase in written premium for the quarter and for the year is due to the relationship with Uber. And that, we had started with three states last March. We added New York at the end of the second quarter, or early beginning of the third quarter. So you see the, I believe, $58 million roughly of premium in the third quarter. It's how we look out over the next couple of quarters at least. We feel really good about that business. We've established a good relationship with the management and we believe we're getting good driver scores and all as we look at our performance in terms of claims with the underlying Uber drivers. So we feel good about where that business is and we would love to continue to grow that business over time.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Greg. Can we go to the next question?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley, Your question, please?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just a follow-up on the severity trends. So it's going up a little bit. I just wonder how does that compare with your expectation. And also, you don't disclose the BI severity anymore, if anything on that front as well.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yes. Thank you. This is Glenn. So it is in line with our expectation and it's interesting. As Tom said before, when you think about what you see in our release on a quarterly basis, the paid severity, last quarter, you saw 3.7. We look at a lot of different trends underneath that. We're breaking down all the different coverages between property damage, collision, comprehensive, we're breaking down parts and labor and future trends, and we're booking to a number beyond that.","So, when the shift between the second and third quarter from a 3.7 to 7.7, we really see it in a more smooth basis of looking at it. It's about 5 or a little over 5 for the full year. Now, that compares to a longer-term trend for both the industry and Allstate closer to 4. So it is elevated. Like, we do see some pressure across the industry in the property damage lines. And what's moving the physical damage is higher repair costs, which is in the disclosure and John mentioned earlier with more sophisticated cars, with more expensive parts and then also an elevation in total losses. And those two things are connected because what has happened is repairs have accelerated a little faster than the values of cars.","So naturally, if the repairs go up more than the cost of the cars, then you trigger total loss on more vehicles. And again, it's something we've seen across the industry. And the key for you, I think, is it's baked into our numbers. So when you see our combined ratios, it's in there, our projection to what we're seeing from an ultimate loss trend standpoint.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What about BI side?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, I'm sorry, on the BI.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","We don't disclose BI, but it would be slightly above general inflation.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's great. My follow-up on that is that as you see your pricing sort of increases slowing down, but those \u2013 like a claim severity and frequency less favorable, but frequency trending up, over long-term, last few years, you have seen your underlying combined ratio have improved from 89% back in 2015 now to 85%-ish. So will we see that ratio drift higher in the coming years? And will you also consider \u2013 Tom, you mentioned your investment income is going higher. Will that also be part of the consideration what your target of your underlying combined ratio?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I would come back to the conversation we were having with Greg and Elyse, which is our mission is to earn a excellent return on capital for our shareholders on all of our lines. We have done that on auto insurance for a long period of time. When something happens that's unexpected, we take actions pretty quickly and focusing first on protecting returns, second on growth. That's kind of been our mantra.","So I don't really see any change in that going forward. So we don't \u2013 it's about getting good returns for shareholders. And as these pieces bounce around, Glenn actually mentioned to me, it's a little bit like having investment portfolio, some pieces go up, some pieces go down, but in total, we're getting you a good total return on auto insurance and we expect to continue to do that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your question, please?","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned telematics. I'm not sure if you mentioned increased use of it. But maybe you can just shed light on the goal in terms of penetration for telematics. Are you providing incentives to your agency force to sell it? Just kind of curious how to think about the growth of that over time.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Mike, you should expect the penetration to go up over time. We're pushing hard at it. We have a series of efforts underway in the Allstate and Esurance brands to do that aggressively. We'd like to move that into the Encompass brand as well. We want to do that first and foremost, because it's really good for the customers. We can give them a more specific price for them.","So, for example, right now, you estimate where somebody's driving based on where the car is garaged. With telematics we can determine exactly where you drive not just where it's parked. There are other things that we've expanded the telematics offering to include Milewise. So if you live in New Jersey and you haven't seen our ads, as you come across the ferry or in the subway, I'm like really depressed, because people like to \u2013 some people like to pay by the mile. They have to pay to have the car covered in case like something happens to it or something steals while it just sitting, but then some people like to pay by the mile. So it gives us the ability to give a highly specific, individualized price tailored to how they want to use their car.","We're also using it to improve the driving experience. So that includes everything, like just telling them how to be a safer driver, to maybe some location-based offers to them, car health stuff that we're working on, you heard about the Life360 stuff that Mario mentioned. So we expect to use telematics at an increased rate.","Now, it's not that easy to get from just offering it to getting it used. So we have a number of ways in which we do that. We were first in the market with the mobile app, which is the easiest, lower customer barrier to use. It doesn't enable you to connect the car though due to (41:32) So we'll work through that.","We do not pay special incentives to agency owners to get them do it because we believe this is in our customers best interest. But getting them from saying yes to getting them to be connected requires a different set of processes. And we do that differently at Esurance than we do at Allstate, but you should expect that number to continue to go up. I believe that in the future, this will be the primary driver of insurance pricing in auto insurance because it's every bit as powerful as credit. And those who have been hanging around auto insurance like I have for a while, credit sort of ripped through the industry and pricing in the early part of the 2000. And this is a little harder to implement because it requires a customer to do something rather than just buying data from TransUnion or some like that, but it's equally as powerful. So it will happen","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up is regarding personal auto. Earlier you were kind of walking us through the high level economics and you mentioned a 3 to 1 surplus levels what you guys have always kind of been held to. Given your track record of stable profitability, can that ratio ever move higher one day?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Let me make a general comment about how we think about capital and Mario can talk about specifically about auto insurance. So, over the last decade, we've built a highly sophisticated set of econometric models to help us determine capital at the individual risk level, even below auto insurance, rolling all the way up to the entire company. So we start with individual risk on a individual basis. Then, there's all kind of diversifications, covariance, all kind of stuff that comes into the numbers. And we use that to price homeowners insurance in Louisiana. We use it. So we're constantly looking at it. Mario can talk about the work we're doing on capital because that is something we have had a long track record on, which is effectively sourcing capital whether that be cat bonds, perpetual preferred or anything else, so we look at it in a lot of different ways.","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Yes. So, Mike, I think the 3 to 1 comment Tom made was kind of historical industry kind of metric that's thrown around. We, as Tom mentioned, I think, take a far more sophisticated and economic approach to capital requirements when we look at the underlying risks in a particular business and attribute specific levels of capital that add risk. And based on that, we think we are earning really attractive returns in auto and will continue to do so.","So I think your question around can it move up over 3 to 1, I think our view based on what we think the economic requirements for auto is, it's probably already there. And the returns that we're achieving in that business are really attractive.","And then, in terms of sourcing capital for the business over time, I'd say we're constantly looking at ways to improve the return profile really across all of our businesses. And sometimes that means using other people's capital that have different return profiles and different return targets than we might for a business. It's more efficient to use that kind of capital. We've done that in the property business with cat bonds and reinsurance. We'll continue to explore it in other lines of businesses to continue to kind of sculpt the return profile and enhance both the efficiency of our capital structure and the returns that we get on our businesses.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please?","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. The first question I have-","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Amit, could you speak up just a little bit? It's a little -","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is it better?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Sorry. The first question goes back to the discussion on the claim severity side. I was wondering if we could look at it from a different manner. Can you talk about \u2013 when you look at the new business and the age of the vehicle that is insured, I would assume that there is a very strong correlation between new business and recently manufactured cars. And if that is the case, with ADAS now being standard, could we be surprised by these claim severities continuing to tick up faster than initially anticipated?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","First, the new business is not always new cars. So some renewals are newer cars and obviously, some new business, there are older cars. So we do do make and model pricing. Glenn can talk about the new to renewal loss ratio relative to...","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","... if we look at \u2013 evaluate the profitability of new business. And then, I would say, as it relates to the future, I would come back to the part of \u2013 like, if we see it, we price for it.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Amit. Taking a couple of different ways here. One, just from the balance of new business or balance of growth that we're getting, I'll again say, 60% of our growth is being driven by retention. So that's a really balanced way to grow, 40% is based on new business.","And when we look at the new business from a risk profile, we feel good about where we are from the type of risk we're bringing on, the full coverage, the bundled policies and the risk trades that we bring on. So, all of those have been favorable to our expectations.","So, as we look at new to renewal, it's performing as we expected and we're very comfortable with the growth. In terms of your comments on newer cars, as we look at data \u2013 and it is one of the things we look relative to all of our trends. How many cars we have in each cohort? The average car in the car park out there right now is about 11.5 years old.","So, that moves over time, every year, it moves forward about a year. And what we're actually seeing is we're right in line with what you'd expect. Every year, we get about a year newer. It just moves exactly about the way you expect it to move and we're not seeing major shifts along those lines.","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. That's actually very helpful. The other question, and the only other question I have, is on the broader discussion on Amazon and Travelers. And I know it's early days in this change. I'm curious would Allstate have an opportunity to partner with them? And with this although being in early stages, does longer time, does this change the margin dynamics with Amazon and maybe Jet.com and Walmart having these partnerships? Thanks.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, Well, first, we go where the customer goes. So, where the customer wants to be, that's where we'll be. And, as you know, we have four different approaches to doing that. Those who want to go to a local agency do via Allstate and a branded product. Those who want to do direct, Esurance. And those who want to go through independent agency, don't really care about the brand, go to Encompass. And then, we don't talk much about Answer Financial, which is our online aggregator, which I believe is probably the biggest in the country or if it's not the biggest, it's second biggest. And we've been using Arity's data to make it a two-sided advertising platform. So, we have some work to do.","So, we will go wherever the customer wants to go. As it relates to Amazon, SquareTrade is a major player on the Amazon platform, protection policy. So, it's a good piece of business for us. We like working with them. We know how to compete aggressively by changing prices every 15 seconds or something there, we need to. So we're open to doing it whichever way.","And I would say, what we've tried to do, Amit, is build a model that's flexible, that leverages those core capabilities that they're in middle of those two ovals and use them to go wherever we want. So, if you look at the transportation network companies, our claims experience is of great value to those companies because we're really good at claims, particularly bodily injury claims. And so we're happy to sell insurance to Uber and thrilled about it, and like the partnership and like to grow it. So we'll go wherever the customer goes.","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the answer and good luck for the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question, please?","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, two questions for you. First one, Tom, just curious, ad spend really kicking up here. Understand, profitability is great and you want to maximize the amount of business you can get at these profitability levels. But should we kind of expect those levels to continue here going forward?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Brian, are you talking about the actual reported combined ratio?","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","No, I'm looking at ad spend. Just looking at amount of -","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Oh, I'm sorry, ad spend. I missed that part of the question.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Apologize, yeah, advertising.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, advertising. Well, it's different by brand, right. So, Esurance has dialed up their advertising spend this quarter. And as Steve (51:35) mentioned, that's led to really good results. We're up 7% in units over last year. We like that. We've also launched new advertising in the Allstate brand and the early read on that advertising is it's effective, and we like it. So, as that works, we'll roll out.","Now, I would say, that the spend is one thing to think about, but it's also like where do you spend and how do you spend. And that's where you can increase your effectiveness and your efficiency and where we use a lot of math to decide, should it be on TV, where you and everybody else sees it or is it better in a highly specific and a targeted lead or ad that we buy. So, we look at it in total. For competitive reasons, we don't give out ad spend on a forward-looking basis. I would say we like what we see. We want to keep growing. So you probably won't see it come down, how about that.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Good, make sense. And then, another one a little longer-term thinking here. Tom, I'm just curious with the legalization of cannabis in more and more states and in Canada, what are you guys' thoughts with respect to the potential that will have on claims frequency trends or will it have any?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, I think it will, obviously, if it leads to increased consumption of cannabis, that obviously will impact accidents. And we've seen that a little bit in the states where it has been rolled out. It's a little hard to distinguish. You can't really tell how much of it is because somebody smoked a joint and how much because it was icy outside. But it does appear to have a positive impact being a negative, like increased (53:26) frequency. Unclear on severity just yet. And so we'll price for it.","When it's legal, whatever is legal is legal. I think the bigger issue there is from a fairness in society standpoint, if somebody is driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, the person who is hurt is supposed to be taken care of by that person who caused the problem. And with drunk driving, it's relatively easy with breathalyzers to tell at this moment in time, the person was inebriated and therefore, that led to the cause, and so that then leads to damages, some of which we have to pay for because we're insuring those people, some of which are things that happened to our customers and we have to spend them in court, which we do to make sure they get the right amount of money back.","The more complicated piece on cannabis is there's not an immediate test when someone's driving. So, you can't blow into a breathalyzer and tell whether somebody is under the influence of cannabis. So, we'd like to see some science brought to bear on it. I'm sure science can solve the problem. But if we've decided as a society that it's legal to use these drugs, then we should make sure that the infrastructure around making sure people are held accountable for their individual actions is improved.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Allstate; question, we've had a little bit of a meltdown in equities, risk assets being marked down. Some are nervous about trends in private equity, others aren't. What are you doing in general on risk relative to the investment portfolio? And if there was a meltdown in private equities, how much liquidity could you raise?","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Hi, this is John. Thanks for the question. I think, first, it makes sense to take a step back and think about how we own all the assets in our portfolio. We're highly integrated. We talked about the capital framework. Mario did earlier and Tom did. We're highly integrated in how the firm thinks about capital across the board. When it comes to any risk asset, performance-based or private equity being one of them, we tend to take a longer-term view on those assets. And they match up quite well versus our overall liability structure, of which some of that is quite long in terms of its duration.","I'd take a step back. While we are seeing volatility in this particular year, we saw a flash kind of late January through middle of February and a little bit this month, which we've subsequently recovered slightly from. Equities over the last three years have returned 17% per annum over that three year period. So, we really take a long run view.","Now, having said that, we do think about it. And we have \u2013 about half of our equity exposure is in public equities, which you're going to see more immediate pricing in. When you look at our performance-based assets, it's not right to think of them as any one thing. We tend to go into more idiosyncratic risk. We go into different parts of the world. We go down in market cap structure, so smaller companies. We also in there have things like real estate, infrastructure, agriculture, farm land. So, it's fairly diversified.","So, it tends \u2013 the transformation and the valuation of those properties tend to take place over multiple years. It's not just a beta along with the equity market. There's a fundamental transformation of value that takes place that at times we're very involved in. So we look at it. We have a lot of leverage in the portfolio to adjust, not only in private equity but in other areas. It's more likely that we would adjust in public markets because the transaction costs would be lower. And we have more than sufficient, adequate capital and liquidity to deal with any such event.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. I had to step away for a fire drill. Did you quantify the non-cat weather impact in either of the overall combined ratio or homeowners?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","No. It's really hard to do, Bob, as you know. You can look at, the underlying combined ratio excludes cat, it's up. It's up and for a whole variety of reasons, some of which is weather. But to determine weather, that was the rainstorm in Des Moines, or what that would have been last year and how that related to the prior three or four years, we've not done. It's really impossible to do. What we have said is the business earns an 88 combined ratio, a 12 point margin, really good returns. And we feel comfortable with it.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Cool. Just trying to get a sense -","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","And when we need to raise price, we raise price by state, like it's \u2013 not every state the time. Like there are some states where we need to raise homeowner prices, other places where we're earnings even better than average returns.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Jonathan, I know we're at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question then for today comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your question, please?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. If we were to see an uptick in frequency in auto, how quickly can rates respond?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I mean, I would look at what happened in 2015 and 2016 as a way to get an estimate of that. You saw it tick up quickly then, you saw how quickly we could act. And I think we've learned some. I think actually, if we were to relive that story again, we'd spread the rate a little differently. And I think it would \u2013 probably we would have less decrease in the number of units, but we moved about as quickly as you can move, given the regulatory environment in that period of time.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay perfect. Thank you so much.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Okay. Thank you all for participating. Another great quarter for us where our strategy is working, we're achieving our operating priorities and we're going to keep driving shareholder value. So, we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.

Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President to our Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President to Allstate Life & Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.","This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results underlying auto margins improved, homeowners' results remain strong, and we generated a good total return on the investment portfolio.","Let's start on slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves for discontinued lines.","The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter and the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first nine months of the year, which is at the favorable end of the full-year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90.","Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio and results in a lower interest income and we had a strong return on the performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter. Total investment returns remain strong at 1.3% for the quarter, and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price appreciation in the bond portfolio.","Let's go to slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property-liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the four segments of the property-liability market are shown on the bottom diagram on this page here.","So, the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written that serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in force, the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise auto insurance prices, and you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention.","Allstate brand auto net written premium grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average written premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2 points better than the prior-year quarter. Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for Allstate brand.","Moving over to the right, Esurance serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Policies in force declined 0.6% from a year ago, due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium grew by 5.4%, as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium, more than offset the policy decline. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 109.8 and 106.0 reflected different economic model in this segment, where acquisition costs are expensed really in the first policy year versus spread out as commissions over the life of the policy. The underlying auto loss ratio of 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions.","Encompass in the upper left competes for customers in our local advice, are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns, and consequently, policies in force declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than third quarter of 2015.","Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand neutral self-service customers, it an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risk. Total non-proprietary written premium of $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior-year.","Let's turn to slide 4. As you know, we establish operating priorities for each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all of our stakeholders. The first three priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model.","We balance these efforts with a focus on both short-term result and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate agencies, so they can be better trusted advisors. For example, we successfully introduced new personalized insurance proposal and have now sent out over 2 million of those.","At the same time to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance prices, which has a negative impact in customer satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowners' insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits.","As you know, we proactively invested our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk adjusted return over a time period that are either appropriate for the liabilities they back, or are consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute.","Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding Arity connected car platform and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection products.","Now let me turn it over to John.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Tom. I'll start on slide 5. Property-liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first three quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior-year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion through the first nine months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first three quarters of last year.","The recorded combined ratio for property-liability was 95.5 in the third quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes in prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015, and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter of 2016 was 17.8% below prior-year results due to higher catastrophe losses and a $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines.","In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows policy in force growth.","Property-liability's policies in force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these two trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy.","The bottom right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red, in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars and illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses.","Going to slide 6, the chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016, improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio.","As seen on the chart on the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior-year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable gap to $40.","Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlying losses are based on a sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We use a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss costs.","For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice count received, as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, paid frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claim staffing.","To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity trends for the property damage and bodily injury coverages, which are shown on the bottom two graphs.","Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss costs and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average paid severity per claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015, and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last two quarters.","Paid severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss costs and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and the greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim.","The decrease in paid frequency and increase in paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflects payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments.","And, as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016. But those that were paid had higher average payments. Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016.","One of the components of our profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers, and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our reported underwriting results.","Slide 7 provides detail on the auto profit improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter of 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all three brands. This brings our total for the first nine months of 2016 to $1.2 billion, higher than the full-year of 2015.","The chart on the lower right shows average premium increased 7.7% compared to the prior-year quarter, an acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium, shown by the gray line, lags average written premium and is up 6%.","Moving to slide 8, the chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto policies in force have decreased, which reflects the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior-year quarter.","The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our profit improvement actions, our absolute levels of new business production have stabilized over the last couple quarters.","Slide 9 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the left shows the recorded combined ratio remained a very strong 75.9 in the quarter, despite significant catastrophe losses. On a trailing 12 month basis, the recorded combined ratio was 84.3.","The chart on the right shows annualized average earned premium per policy increased by 2.1% over the prior-year quarter and average underlying loss and expense per policy increased by 2.4%. The gap between these two measures improved by $7 compared to the third quarter of last year.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, John. Slide 10 provides overview of our profitability and growth trends for Esurance and Encompass. The Esurance recorded combined ratio as shown on the top left chart, was 109.8 in the third quarter and 106.0 in catastrophes, prior-year reserve re-estimates, and the amortization of intangibles are excluded.","You'll remember, with the direct distribution model, combined ratios are impacted by acquisition expenses being written off much faster than the agency channel, where commissions are spread over the policy life. This result also adversely impacted by expenses related to expanding into homeowners insurance and new markets. The underlying loss ratio of 74.7 is higher than our long-term target and we will continue to take actions to raise Esurance returns.","On the top right, Esurance written premium was up 5.4%, while policies in force declined by 0.6% points compared to a year ago, reflecting the auto improvement initiatives.","The chart on the bottom left shows Encompass' improvement in both recorded and underlying combined ratios. The recorded combined ratio of 98.3 was 3 points better than the third quarter a year ago, and the underlying combined ratio of 89.3, improved by 1.6 points.","The chart on the bottom right show the top line trend, which you can see was impacted by profit improvement actions. Policies in force, shown on the bottom right by the gray line, declined by 12.6%, while net written premium, represented by the blue line, declined by 9.7%. Encompass will continue to take pricing, underwriting, and expense actions in order to achieve target margins.","Turning to slide 11, Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $571 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter, with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016 respectively. Operating income was $44 million lower than the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower investment income.","Across the bottom, we show net and operating income for each business. The Allstate Life business operating income of $51 million in the third quarter decreased $7 million compared to last year due to higher expenses and lower investment margins.","Allstate Benefits operating income of $25 million for the third quarter was relatively consistent with the third quarter of last year. The Annuity business generated operating income of $18 million, down $36 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to reduced investment income resulting from the 2015 portfolio repositioning and lower limited partnership income compared to a very strong prior-year quarter.","At the top right of the slide, we provide the liability balance and investment mix for our immediate annuity business before and after the portfolio repositioning. The proceeds from the sale of long-duration bonds are being invested over time in performance-based and public equity investments as you can see by the increased allocation of the assets in the chart. While we will maintain a significant allocation to interest-bearing investments, we will continue to increase our performance-based investments, which are well suited to the long-dated immediate annuity liabilities.","Slide 12 shows our investment results. We increased our emphasis of performance-based investments after the financial crisis to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk by emphasizing ownership over lending. This increased allocation to investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agriculture related businesses from $4.1 billion at year end 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown in the upper left chart. These investments require higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect it will deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders.","Total return for the third quarter in the upper right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields.","Gross investment income is shown on the bottom left graph. You can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generating income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year.","Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right. The property-liability yield is closer to current market yields as a result of its shorter duration. Allstate Financial's yield reflects the impact of last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning, but the year remains higher due to its longer duration and because investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability reductions.","Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity increase of $20.9 billion in the third quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 19.6%, a reduction of 0.4% points from the prior-year quarter.","Book value per common share of $51.48 increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation, partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We held $2.7 billion of Holding Company assets at quarter's end, which when combined with our modest leverage ratio provides a high degree of financial flexibility.","During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At the beginning of third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our common shareholders.","Now, I'll ask Jonathan to open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please? Elyse, you might have your phone on mute.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, sorry. Good morning. First question in terms of the commentary that you provided on severity in terms of bodily injury and the process changes you saw in the quarter, so it seems like that was just a reconfiguration between frequency and severity and we'll see those trends move back to normal in the fourth quarter? So, I guess, is it the right way to think about it, that there was no real impact on your underlying auto margin from those changes?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, Elyse. It's Matt Winter. Thanks for the question. Well, as you correctly pointed out, there's a fluctuation as you see on slide 6, you see some offset between the frequency and severity.","That being said, there were some process changes that do influence some of those results, so we'll see it normalize, but it may not go back to exactly where it was previously, because there were some of the changes, as John referred to in his remarks. There's some enhanced documentation requirements.","So the next changes, I think in response to a question you asked last quarter, I talked about the timing impact and the peristalsis that sometimes occurs in the claims area, where you have a buildup of claims that are then processed. And especially in BI with the long tail on it, you can see that happen.","So, you can expect to see some fluctuation, but the general trend here that you see at the bottom right on slide 6, which is that overall, the combination in frequency and severity is declining and offsetting itself, that we expect to continue.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-on to that, as you said, getting to a more favorable loss cost environment when we talk about frequency and severity, how do you guys think about what type of rate you need to take from here? I mean, the level of rate increase did slow a bit in the quarter. Just kind of a forward view as you think about the rate you might take into Q4 and into 2017, just kind of high level?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Well, I can't give you \u2013 we don't forecast or predict rate that we're going to take in the future. What I can tell you is that we continue to look at actual rate need, and the rate need is based upon paid trends. We look at that rate need, we look at our indications and we make determinations on the localized basis.","Take into consideration economic capital, the rate needs, our competitive position and a bunch of other criteria in determining what our rate need is and in determining what rate we'll take. But I think it's impossible for me to predict for you what that will look like in the future.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","This is Tom. Let me add one thought. As we increase rates and obviously as our costs go up, we need to recover those costs, so that's part of it. If in fact those costs moderate over time, you expect that component of increases to go down.","That said, we still need to increase our margin to where it has been historically. So, I think you should expect to see our price increases stay above our cost increases, those are the times when we get back our target margin.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your question please?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much. I guess, couple of questions here just outside of auto. But in Allstate Financial, as we look at this quarter post disposition of Lincoln Benefit, should we be looking at these levels as sort of where you expect them to be? It seems like there's maybe a little bit of variability on one element in the business, but the others seem to be squarely at that run rate. Just love to get some, a little bit of color on that?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Mike, let me make just a comment, strategic about the positioning we talked about, then Mary Jane can talk about the results at Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits. So, first, Lincoln Benefit, I think it was 2014 we sold it. So, we kind of came around the track on that one already. And so you saw that really beginning in last year's numbers.","This year, what you're seeing, it's a different strategic choice, which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the Annuity business. So, as Steve mentioned we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 years to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments.","With current interest rates, it would not generate, we took all that money and invested it today. First, we couldn't get the right duration. Secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all those amounts off, so we would then have to put some capital in.","What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities, which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and the risk is about the same. So, we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint, that's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up from Lincoln Benefit. Mary Jane, might want to make some comments about Life and Benefit.","Mary Jane Bartolotta Fortin - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, after that. So, for the Allstate Life business, this quarter, the earnings were down; and in this quarter, we did have our annual review of DAC unlock. So this quarter does have a $2 million impact in the Life business for that. And also, we did have some one-time expenses that did impact the quarter. So, that is impacting the results this quarter. We have been running favorable in our mortality, which is \u2013 for the last four quarters, we have been experiencing favorable mortality, which has been impacting those results in a positive way.","In terms of the Annuities, as Tom mentioned, we've been actively putting the $2 billion to work, $1.3 billion has been put to work year-to-date. The returns on the performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the Annuity business. So, we'll continue to actively invest in that asset class, which will generate earnings additionally over time.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And then, Tom, one question for you, I guess, on Esurance. I remember post the transaction, you talked a lot about economic value of policies and sort of thinking about that platform on a marginal basis. I guess what we have seen here recently is, we've been taking a lot of rate action consistent with what you're doing in the rest of the auto book.","I guess, I would think, like at a time like this, when you're still smaller than the two big direct peers, that this would be like the exact time that you would want to really grow that business, maybe at a time when others are not growing or at least everyone is not growing as rapidly. Could you just comment a little bit about on that and how you're thinking? It seems like, feels like, maybe Esurance is managing a little bit more the output in terms of earnings as opposed to that sort of platform building element? Thanks.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Mike. First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it, because of the skills and capabilities be brought to it whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing preferred, customers getting into the homeowners business. So, we've added value. And it's a good, strong company, and a much stronger competitor now than it was five years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size.","We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate brand, because we wanted to lean into the growth as you point out. But it was always above our cost of capital. So, we're always like, okay, as Matt, Don and I always talk about -- we're like \"okay, we'll take a lower return, but it's got to be above what our cost is, because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow.\" That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of the products.","That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some, because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place. So, I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like we'll grow our other businesses. But I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing money at growth there. In part because, while we've dramatically improved the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up. And that takes a number of years to invest in that.","So, we like what we got. It's been growing. I think it can be \u2013 it certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But, it's not to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses.","That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics, and because we're big enough, we can take the underwriting losses from that business, if we believe it's economic.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question please?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. On the severity trends, travelers saw an uptick from higher attorney involvement, more fatalities and more occupants per vehicles. And they suggested they might be recognizing a trend before the rest of the industry. Are you seeing anything on this front or how are you avoiding this?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","It's Matt, Sarah. We're not seeing the same kind of trends that some of our competitors have reported regarding severity. Clearly, if you look at our paid severity trends on the bottom right on slide 6, you'll see that there's been some fluctuation; but for the most part, since the beginning of 2015, it's held relatively constant and I'd say in line with inflationary indices.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on the auto insurance underlying margin, should we expect any uptick in the fourth quarter because of seasonality? Does that tend to be a seasonally worse quarter or would rate increases more than offset that?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, Sarah. Obviously, we can't give you a forecast for the fourth quarter because we don't do those forecasts. But I would go off a little bit and just say, we're extremely comfortable with 88 to 90 underlying combined ratio being the range we're going to be in, obviously, because we're at 88 flat for first three quarters. What we'll do is in February, when we announce the full-year results, we'll give you a new outlook for next year.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. First question, do you have any early indication from Hurricane Matthew losses?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","No.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I mean, any indication \u2013 we have no indication we plan to share publicly. We obviously are active out there. We have playing people on the ground doing a bunch of work, Matt said, a bunch of people doing stuff. But we have, as you know, we have a normal monthly cat release where we have catastrophes over $150 million in a quarter, we disclose it to you all.","That is \u2013 when is that? It's in two weeks on a Thursday. So \u2013 and because that was an October storm, it would fall into that. So, you should have some indication of what the number would be, if we do a release in two weeks.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Good. We're waiting for that. Your core loss ratio in auto improved quite a bit year-over-year, but it's still much higher than the 60%-80% average in like 2013 and 2014. Is that still the target you want to get back to? And how long could it take?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, first, that's the $100 per share question. As I maybe answer it \u2013 and Matt will have some \u2013 I'll give you part of my view and Matt will share with you his. First, we don't really just target the underlying, we target the reported. So, we believe as printed is what you need to shoot for.","There's nothing that I see in the value we provide to consumers or in a competitive space that would tell me that we couldn't earn the kind of returns in the auto business that we have earned historically. Nothing has changed in terms of our skills and capabilities other than we've gotten better. So, I think we should be able to earn the kind of economic returns we earned in the past. Matt, you might want to make a comment about target combined ratios.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah. Hi, it's Matt. The only thing I'd add to what Tom said, because I think he's 100% correct, fundamentally there's nothing that's changed in the overall business that would imply limitations that didn't exist before, regarding our ability to earn appropriate returns. But the way we really manage the business is towards the creation of long-term economic value. And so that's not just targeting a specific combined ratio, whether it's recorded or underlying. It's the combination of earning an appropriate return and being able to grow the business at that appropriate return. And so, we'll optimize around long-term profitable growth in the business.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Then related, at what point are you stepping back on the rate increases, more focusing on the pace of growth?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Kai, I think what Matt said was here's \u2013 let me \u2013 one more layer of detail on that. Until we know what frequency and severity is in the future, we can't really determine when we'll be changing our pricing, right? So, if frequency and severity keeps going up, we'll have to continue to raise our prices, so our customers pay for an appropriate amount of money for both the cost we have and the returns we should get, given our skills, capabilities and the capital we put at risk.","To the extent that frequency and severity level out, and we got back to the kind of returns Matt was talking about, then you would see it come down. But, it's really \u2013 until you can predict frequency and severity, you can't really predict future price increases.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much for all the answers.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please?","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, team Allstate. I'm happy to be on this call as a result of pulling almost an all-nighter watching the Cubs on TV last night.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Thank you, Greg. We're excited as well. We decided not to play \"Go Cubs Go\" at the beginning of the call, but there was some pressure to do so.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, I would have been cheering for you, so that would have been good. I wanted to just follow up on some of the commentary on the recorded versus the underlying combined ratio. And I noticed in one of your answers, Tom, you said you wanted to increase the margin back to where it has been historically. And I guess when I'm looking at an 88 underlying combined ratio, considering all the headwinds that you guys have had to deal with, that's a pretty impressive result. And I've always, in the back of my mind, been thinking strategically that as the loss ratio \u2013 the underlying loss ratio began to improve that you would start ramping up expenses again, advertising, etc. Has there been any change in your approach or thinking on that?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Greg, it's Matt. Let me try to take that. So, as we shift out of rate taking mode and enhanced focus on profitability and get back to a more balanced approach, it's not just a question of just ramping up expenses for advertising, because that's just one component of what's necessary to get the system growing. So, it's multiple components, it's \"volume\", it's rate competitiveness, which impacts close rates. It's capacity and agencies and it's number of points of presence.","And what happens when you're unfortunately taking a fair amount of rate and we have over the last several quarters, is it impacts all of those things. It's not just that you're not advertising, a lot is you're eating up aging capacity or impacting your close rate. It's hard to put on new agencies in that environment and so your number of points of presence tends to stabilize.","So, as we get more stable and as we believe we can see frequency and severity stabilize and that puts us in a better position to begin, the growth initiatives, you'll see a whole bunch of things change and one of them might be some additional marketing expense. But it's only a small component and I would say that marketing in and of itself, if you don't have the agent capacity and if your competitiveness isn't there, it's not a very efficient spend. So, we'll consider that among the other levers that are available in the business to work towards long-term profitable growth.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Right, that's sort of two questions, and I think there's \u2013 I want to make sure we're clear on our philosophy on expenses. So, I think some people, as we've gone through this increase in frequency and severity that Matt was talking about, look at the reduction of expenses. So, we just cut expenses so we could make our number. That's not the case.","Our philosophy on expenses is not let's do a target P&L number. First, don't spend it if your customers don't want it. Do spend it if your customers do want it. Secondly, Matt talked about this integrated basis. If you're advertising your agencies aren't ready or your competitive position is not right, and it doesn't really make any sense. We really do run it on an integrated basis.","And then we also invest for the long-term. So I don't want to \u2013 in 2011, you remember, I think, (41:58) if we may have been $750 million or something like that in net income and we didn't back off a wit on our advertising expense, because we knew we needed to do that to stay competitive for the long-term.","So, we will always have things, whether it's advertising, technology, investing, so we try to manage it really on the long-term economics that Matt was talking about. So, it's our philosophy, sometimes when I read some of the reports that have come out, it feels like people think we've got this, you know, we're managing just to get the P&L number and that's not the way to run a business, except we can cut our costs. Matt's got a big program going on a continuous improvement, we're reducing our costs as aggressively as we can, except we need to use that money to invest in something else, we will, because we think it makes sense for us.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great color. Considering you've held on to your underlying combined ratio target and all the headwinds, it still is a remarkable accomplishment. One other area, and I noticed that you referenced it briefly in your slides, I think slide 3, it just continues to be a considerable amount of oxygen spent on driverless cars and its impact on auto insurance. Can you give us an update on what you're doing with Arity and what your thinking is in this area?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sure. I'll go up for a second and then I'll come down very quickly to Arity. We think the personal transportation industry is going to change dramatically and we think that's an opportunity for us to do more for our customers. As a reason, it will change dramatically, it's incredibly inefficient. So, we have about $4 trillion tied up in hardware called cars and trucks and stuff like that. We spend about $2 trillion a year in direct costs making that work. Capacity utilization is in the \u2013 even at peak hours is in the 30%, 34% range and there's one person in the car. A 20% improvement in the efficiency of that system would be a 5% increase in household income in America.","We think that's going to happen. It's going to take a while to happen because it's an economically dispersed system. Nobody controls all of it, there's lots of different pieces to it. So, it's not just the autonomous car, it's shared vehicle, it's machine-to-machine communication, it's better stoplights. There's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to change in that system.","Arity is one of our efforts to take advantage of that. So, Arity is outside the insurance company. It provides services to Allstate and Esurance. These services that the insurance companies get from it, first it gives them the ability to do a more accurate price for our customers, because we know exactly how they drive, where they drive, and when they drive. But, we have a different model than others, we've taken it beyond pricing to include things like improving the driving experience.","So adding applications on to our continuous connection to help those customers have a better driving experience, and then also to use that technology for other things. So, there's many other uses, many other ways that value could be created by cars being connected. We can share that value with customers. We can use that value to reduce costs for other people and capture those costs. So, there's really a three-part focus. Better pricing, better services, and additional ways to use a connected car. So Arity is pursuing all three of those. It will do that for our insurance companies, we'll do it for non-insurance companies, and we will also do it for other insurance companies as well. So we think it's a platform where we will all be stronger because we are together without giving up our competitive ability to price with our own data in the marketplace.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question please?","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks. I just have a follow-up on some of the process changes. I guess first of all, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the thought process that went into putting those in place. And also, is it possible that those changes could have a positive exogenous impact on frequency going forward? In other words, was the lack of those changes potentially something that maybe caused frequency to spike up in 2015?","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Ryan, this is Matt. We'll distinguish between process changes that impacted PD and those that impacted BI. If you recall in the last quarter and potentially the quarter before that, I referred to our desire in this environment to capture more and more information regarding the claim and PD, so that we're better able to manage staffing costs and appropriately serve our customers and ensure that the claims machine is ready to deal with and help out customers at this time.","So, we began capturing a greater amount of information at first notice of loss, especially on the PD side. And so, we told you at that point, and it continues to hold true, that there is a differential between the gross and the paid. And that we will over-capture information on PD and have some of those claims closed without payment. That's okay as far as we're concerned. We're more interested in effectively managing the system and taking care of customers than anything else. So, if we have to have some dislocation in the numbers, and some volatility in the numbers to do that properly, we'll do that.","On the BI side, as John said in the opening comments, this really had to do with just requiring some enhanced documentation for injuries and related medical treatment in our numbers. And so, that does influence the mix, it does influence the cost, it impacts the mix and the timing. It impacts both the frequency and severity.","But none of these things impact our overall actual loss trends or our reserving or the P&L. Because as John mentioned, in his opening comments all of these changes and all of this information is factored in, along with our paid trends and all of the other information that we review on a very careful basis in setting our reserve levels and determining our actual loss costs.","So, yes, we have some volatility in some of the operational claim statistics that we show you. But no, it doesn't imply any real change in the actual P&L type statistics that we manage the business on, take rate based upon, and report on.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Ryan, it's Tom. Let me \u2013 maybe one other additional angle on it. We're always trying to get better, right? And you see that show up. As Matt points out, I think splitting in those two categories is absolutely right. You will see to the extent \u2013 the way we do our reserving, when we \u2013 if we see it, we book it. And we don't \u2013 but we have to see it. So, as Matt points out, you do see it in PD earlier. So, those claims tend to get resolved in about 90 days. To an extent, we're getting better. And to your extent, you would see it in this stuff.","On the BI basis, that takes several years to really get your arms around it. So that tends to be \u2013 it takes much longer to settle those cases. So, whatever we've done in opening practices, as Matt points out, is reflected in our loss costs. And if you look at our reserving practices over a 10 year or 20 year period, we have pretty consistent ability to accurately predict what losses are.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on, I guess, how to think about the re-underwriting of the book, the re-pricing. So, we've seen retention come down. And obviously, we associate that with better margins. But I'm curious \u2013 maybe you guys could talk a little bit about how you make sure that you're getting \u2013 that you're not losing policyholders that are already meeting profitability objectives.","In other words, is there may be a way you can quantify for every three drivers you lose, because they don't want to renew at the rate that's appropriate, you maybe lose one because they \u2013 that you wouldn't have wanted to lose? And I'm just curious how much of the loss retention potentially as you guys losing clients that were already meeting profitability at Allstate? Thanks.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Ryan, Matt will give you a specific answer to your question, but I would say we don't want to lose any customers. We just want to get the right price for them.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","Ryan, it's Matt. So, let me follow up on that. It's a really good question. And I think it's important to remember I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we, as we've taken rate, tended to take segmented rate. That is, we did not just spread rate along the entire book in any geography, but did it by sub segment, looking at those categories of customers where we were having margin pressure. So, we didn't take the rate in equal doses across an entire book; but in fact broke it down, so that we were applying the rate need to those segments of the business that were most problematic.","In some cases, that tended to be newer customers, shopping customers, segments that as we had expanded our books over the last couple of years tend to be more volatile and they shop more often. And so, if we had pressure in that segment and we took rate there, it's not surprising that we had some renewal pressure. But we tried very hard, as Tom said, not to lose any customers, and not to have any impact. But it is an unintended consequence, an expected consequence, whether or not an intended consequence of our need to get margin appropriate.","Any time you take rate, you stimulate shopping behavior. And we know that when you stimulate shopping behavior, you are going to lose some segment of those customers. And the same thing will happen to our competitors as they now take rate and begin to disrupt their books as well. We will be the recipient of some of that. And we hope that as we emerge out of \u2013 you will recall, we took a lot of rate in the last quarter in the second quarter, and in some of the larger states, so that is why our number looked particularly large in second quarter.","But as that comes down a little bit, we hope to be less disruptive to our customer base. And on a system-wide basis, we hope to get back to a more normalized basis where we're not disrupting customers. It's not good for customers. Obviously, we think they're all better off staying with Allstate, and it's also not good for our agencies who are dealing with that disruption.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. So, just back to this BI-PD recalibration. Is there any risk in future quarters as you go through a processes change that we've missed something and this is a \u2013 this will lead to whether in your favor or against you favorable or unfavorable development?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Josh, it's Tom. We have a really sophisticated set of processes the way we estimate loss ratio. So, as Matt mentioned, we start with the actual number of claims that get reported. We then go through and say how many are paid, how many are not paid. We do it by state, we do it by risk class, we do it by coverage. We have a whole variety of statistical methods we use to determine what those trend lines look like and where it goes. We do it by year. We do it \u2013 I mean we slice and dice this every way. So, the answer is, we feel very good about the way in which we do it. It's accurate.","And I would just say, there's obviously, as you point out, some volatility and some risk. But we try to mitigate that by being thorough. And so, the statistics you see on the bottom of that page are just one of many, many, many statistics we use to determine it. So, we think we're accurate and we'll just continue to adjust it as we go forward, whether that's up or down.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, it looks radical to us because of the limited amount of information we are receiving from your end. Things haven't changed in that radical a way?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I think that's accurate. Yeah. And there are times when I'm sad that we give you that information, because we do try to be complete transparency, but hopefully it doesn't lead to misinformation as opposed to it's just one of many statistics.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then on asbestos, I'm always surprised when you guys get the flu. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 I've heard the story before. Why you have exposure? Why it's up right now? Why, unlike some of your competitors, we shouldn't think this is really a necessity for it to be an annual event? And I'm modeling forward, should I assume zero in the years going forward? How should I think about it?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, I can't tell you what to assume going forward, because we think with the reserves we have up now are accurate for what we will pay out in the future on a discounted basis. So that's...","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That makes sense, of course. But, in terms of, you have indirect exposure. You didn't write those policies. Is that right?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, we have two kinds of exposure. We have some indirect, as you point out, which is \u2013 we did reinsurance with other people. We also have some direct exposure. We spend a fair amount of time and the businesses aggressively manage both in terms of the data we have, they collect the information on policies, what we fight on go into (58:14) arbitration.","As you know, we have written this stuff now, been 30 years or something, since 1986, 30 years. So, and when we've had our claim practices, our reserving practices benchmarked for their accuracy and effectiveness, we always get high marks on that.","So we think we're as good as, in fact, better than the average in industry. You can decide what (58:42). If you look at our history, you would see that occasionally, we do have to put up \u2013 we do look at it in some level of detail every year. I would point out I think the IBNR is like 56% to 60%.","Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.","58%.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","58%, so the incurred but not reported is more than half of the amount that we have up. So, while not a completely accurate statistic, the survival ratio is double-digit in years, depending on that coverage and stuff like that, but it's over 10 years or most of the policies \u2013 most of the coverages. So we feel, you know, it's out there. It's the gift that keeps giving.","I can tell you that we used \u2013 environmental used to be much higher and it came way down and asbestos went up. So, because this stuff has been out there for so long and it's likely to be out there for so long. Some of the other trends that are not predictable show up.","So, people back off on environmental cleanups and the environmental stuff goes down. If asbestos, they find a new way to go after the sons and daughters of the people who are impacted by asbestos and say they got it by their parents coming home with asbestos on their clothes, that's a new litigation wave and then it goes up. But, we think it's about right and it's not a huge portion of our liabilities on the balance sheet.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for all the detail.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Okay, Jonathan, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Allstate. Did you make it to Progressive Field, Tom?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","I did not make it to Progressive Field last night, because I wanted to be here for you, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. I'm honored. Telematics, this is an Arity commercial, is it possible that it's already making a big difference for the companies that have it and the ones that don't are seeing worse frequency and severity trends? And how is the launch going for Arity?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Let me see if I can answer your question succinctly. First, it is making a difference for those companies that have it. It's making a difference for us. I don't think that that overrides the overall industry impact of higher frequency and severity. So, I don't think that Telematics will enable you to get around the fact that there are just more miles driven and people get in more accidents when they drive more. So, I don't think that's an answer for why some people's combined ratio did not appear to have moved as much as others.","I can only answer what they do. I do think that it is an opportunity for us to further do more sophisticated pricing, for other people to do more sophisticated pricing. If you look back over a long period of time, when we first moved into credit, first moved into more algorithmic pricing for auto insurance has led to more stability in over our returns for the industry. So, I would just point out the fact that many people today are moving their pricing with respect to frequency and severity, because they have the analytics to know it. And so, I think in the long-term, it's just good for stability and lower volatility and auto insurance profitability.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Let me just close by thanking you all \u2013 saying looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our five operating priorities. We try to balance long-term and short-term priorities in a way that enables us to build a sustainable business model that creates values for our customers, our shareholders and all of our stakeholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman, President and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Mario Rizzo and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Steve Shebik, our Vice-Chair, Glenn Shapiro, the President of Allstate Personal Lines, Don Civgin, the President of Service Businesses, John Dugenske, our Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of our Life, Retirement, and Benefit businesses, and Eric Ferren, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, along with an update to our 2018 reinsurance program, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.","As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And as always, I will be able to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","And now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us and staying current on Allstate's operating results. Let's begin on slide 2. So we had excellent execution of the operating plan which increased growth and profitability in the first quarter. We also benefited from an unexpected decline in auto accident frequency, lower catastrophe losses and a reduction in federal taxes. Net income was $946 million or $2.63 a share with adjusted net income of $1.07 billion or $2.96 per share. Adjusted net income return on equity was 15%. In the table, you can see revenues grew 3.4% on the Property-Liability insurance premiums. Net investment income also increased on good performance-based result.","If you move to slide 3, we're making good progress on all of our five 2018 Operating Priorities. The first three priorities \u2013 better serve our customers, achieve targeted economic returns on capital, and grow the customer base are intertwined to ensure that profitable long-term growth creates shareholder value. We made progress on better serving customers as the Net Promoter Score increased, the customer retention improved from both the Allstate and Esurance brands which is a key driver of growth.","Returns on shareholder capital were also strong. The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 88.0, generated $959 million in underwriting income for the quarter which was an increase of $411 million from the prior-year quarter. Auto insurance underwriting income increased for all three underwritten brands and Allstate brand homeowners insurance continued to generate substantial income and benefited from lower catastrophe losses. Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits also generated attractive returns in part due to lower taxes.","Going to the third one, grow customer base, Allstate brand policies in force increased as the auto and other personal lines grew over the prior-year quarter. Esurance policies increased on growth in the homeowners line. Allstate Benefits continued its long track record of growth with policies in force increasing 6.7% and SquareTrade policies grew 11.9 million or nearly 40% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Investment income increased due to continued strong results from the performance-based portfolio. A total return on the $83 billion portfolio was a negative 50 basis points which included a stable contribution of about 1% from net investment income but that was more than offset by lower fixed income valuations and a decline in equity markets.","Lastly, we're also committed to building long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade is making good progress on the objectives supporting the acquisition and Arity is helping to drive the expansion of Allstate and Esurance's telematics utilization.","Let's go to slide 4, it shows the Property-Liability segment results by customer segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $7.8 billion, a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter. The reported combined ratio of 88.0 was 4.9 points better than first quarter of 2017 due to lower catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned, and lower auto accident frequency that was partially offset by higher operating costs and lower favorable prior-year reserve reestimates. When catastrophes and prior-year reserve reestimates are excluded, the underlying combined ratio was 84.2 for the first quarter of 2018. As you know, our strategy is to provide differentiated customer value propositions for the four consumer segments in the personal lines insurance market. The Allstate brands in the lower left competes in the local advice and branded segments. Net written premium was 5.2% higher than the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior-year quarter.","The underlying combined ratio was 83.2, slightly above the prior-year quarter as continued improvement in auto insurance was offset by an increase in the homeowners insurance. Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer our branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Esurance net written premiums was 7.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 98.4 was 1.8 points better than the prior-year quarter with improvements in both auto and homeowners insurance. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about the brand of insurance they purchase so they mostly go through independent agencies. Premium declined due to the net impact of improving underlying margins. The underlying combined ratio was 87.9, up 1.3 points as we invest in building capabilities to support profitable growth.","John will now go through these Property-Liability results in more detail.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the graph at the top, overall policies in force grew by 52,000 or 0.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The bottom two charts highlight our balanced approach to growing the business. The renewal ratio of 88.3 was an improvement of 0.9 points from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from our continued focus on the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the 5th consecutive quarter, increasing 17% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Growth in new business is due to improved competitive position, increased agency productivity and the expansion of the agency footprint.","Let's go to slide 6 to cover the underwriting results for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the first Quarter was 88.5, 2.2 points lower than the prior-year quarter and generated $579 million in underwriting income. The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average written premium, lower frequency and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 90.0 in the first quarter of 2018 improved 0.9 points compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 1.8 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The expense ratio of 25.0 was 0.9 points above the prior-year quarter due to higher agent and employee-related compensation costs.","The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line, increased 4% to $1,029 while underlying loss and expense shown by the red line increased 3% to $926. This resulted in a favorable gap of $103 per policy. The positive gap between these two trends widened in the first quarter based on lower accident frequency, partially offset by higher severity and expenses.","The bottom left chart on this page provides Allstate brand auto property damage, gross frequency and paid severity results indexed to 2013. In the first quarter, property damage gross frequency declined 2.5% compared to the prior-year quarter and favorable trends remain geographically widespread. After experiencing a sharp increase in accident frequency in 2015 and 2016, trends have improved. And as of the first quarter of 2018, property damage gross frequency is performing in line with levels experienced in 2014. While frequency has declined, property damage paid severity has experienced average annual increases of 4.3% since 2013.","The chart on the bottom right shows the quarterly trends for bodily injury paid frequency and severity. As you can see, these statistics can be volatile, given the timing between opening and settling claims as well as the impact of internal process changes. Given this volatility, we will no longer provide bodily injury paid statistics, beginning next quarter. We will be reviewing other measures that could explain economic results on this longer tail coverage.","Slide 7 shows the operating results for Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on profitability. Homeowners' returns were good, with a recorded combined ratio of 80.8 in the first quarter, 12.9 points better than the prior-year quarter due to lower catastrophe losses. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period, given weather seasonality and variability. Allstate brand homeowners insurance generated $949 million of underwriting income over the last 12 months.","The bottom half of the page provides detail on policies in force. On the lower left, the renewal ratio of 87.5 was 0.4 points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and new issued applications growth accelerated to 14.7%. On the lower right, you can see the size of this line of business, which generates $6.9 billion of premium from 6.1 million policies.","Slide 8 provides financial highlights for Esurance. Esurance generated a combined ratio below 100 in the first quarter and policies in force grew. The recorded combined ratio of 99.3 in the first quarter, shown on the left chart, was 3.1 points below the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by increased premiums earned and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased loss costs.","Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the right chart. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased average premium and policy growth. Policies in force increased 1.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 after being relatively flat since 2015, which followed a period of rapid growth. This quarter's growth was driven by homeowners' policies, as auto policies in force were essentially flat to the prior-year.","Slide 9 provides additional highlights for Encompass. Encompass continues to execute its profit improvement plan. Encompass's recorded combined ratio was 98.4 in the first quarter of 2018, 13.3 points lower than the prior-year, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 87.9 for the first quarter was 1.3 points higher than the prior-year period as a higher expense ratio more than offset improvement in the underlying loss ratio.","Shown on the right chart, Encompass's trailing 12 month net written premium declined 8.2% and policies in force were 12.8% lower in 2018. Planned reductions in states and local markets with inadequate returns has impacted overall topline trends.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mario.","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 10, which provides detail on the service businesses. In the first quarter, revenue growth accelerated to $313 million and policies in force reached 46.5 million. The adjusted net loss was $5 million in the quarter, a $5 million improvement over the prior-year quarter as favorable loss experience at SquareTrade was partially offset by investments in research and business expansion at Arity. As you can see on the right, SquareTrade revenues were $122 million or $63 million above the prior-year but $30 million of that was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Revenues from the other businesses were flat to prior-year.","SquareTrade also made progress on the three objectives supporting its acquisition in January 2017, as you can see from the box at the bottom of the slide. Policies in force grew to 41.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.9 million over the prior-year quarter, largely from domestic customers. Improved loss experience led to adjusted net income of $2 million in the quarter compared to an $8 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. The transition of underwriting risks to Allstate paper is essentially complete and continued progress is being made expanding European cellphone protection policies.","Turning to slide 11, let's review our Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. Allstate Life generated attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income, shown in the top left chart, of $69 million in the first quarter increased $10 million compared to the prior-year quarter. This is primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by adverse mortality. Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income, shown on the top middle chart on the page, was $28 million. The $6 million increase from the prior-year quarter was due to higher premiums and contract charges and the lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher contract benefits. Allstate Benefits continued its strong track record of growth, with premiums and contract charges, shown on the bottom middle chart, increasing 6.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and policies in force growth of 6.7%. Allstate Annuities, on the far right, had adjusted net income of $35 million in the quarter and continued to benefit from good performance-based investment results. Economic returns remain low, due to the relatively high regulatory capital requirements.","Slide 12 highlights our investment results. The chart at the top of the slide provides our asset allocation over time. We proactively manage our investment portfolio based on our long-term strategic risk profile, relevant market conditions and corporate risk appetite. We have increased the portfolio's equity allocation in response to historically-low market yields and to utilize available risk capacity. Our performance-based investments which now total $7.7 billion or 9% of the portfolio are expected to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.","In the lower left, net investment income for the first quarter was $786 million, 5.1% or $38 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Market-based investment income, shown in blue, was stable. Performance-based investment income, shown in gray, was the primary driver of the increase over 2017 generating $181 million of income in the first quarter. Performance-based income was lower than the prior three quarters which benefited from outperformance by certain investments.","The components of total return on our diversified $83 billion portfolio are shown in the table on the lower right. The return was slightly negative in the quarter, reflecting lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields and a decline in equity markets. The 12-month trailing return was 3.8%. With the adoption of the fair value accounting standard during the quarter, changes in the valuation of public equity securities are now a component of realized capital gains and losses as opposed to unrealized gains and losses.","Slide 13 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. Our capital position is excellent. We delivered strong returns, increased book value and maintained a conservative financial position while increasing shareholders' ownership in the company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Adjusted net income return on equity was 15% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018 an increase of 3.1 points compared to the prior-year period and book value per common share increased 11.9% to $58.64. We returned $465 million to common shareholders in the first quarter. This included repurchasing 3.5 million shares of our common stock for $333 million, leaving $935 million remaining on our current repurchase program. We paid $132 million in common shareholder dividends. As a reminder, the board of directors approved a 24% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.46, which was paid on April 2 and is not included in the amount returned in the first quarter. We continually look to optimize our capital structure and in the first quarter we issued $575 million of perpetual preferred stock and $500 million of senior notes. The proceeds of these issuances are for general corporate purposes, including the redemption, repayment or repurchase of certain outstanding securities.","Now, I will ask Jonathan to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for the call and taking my questions. I suppose the most obvious place to start would be just around the underlying combined ratio guidance for the year considering that the first quarter result was substantially better than what your annual target is, I'm curious if your thinking has changed or what your perspective about that is? And also in the context of generating that really attractive result, I'm curious about what your view is on product positioning and competitive positioning in the marketplace?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Greg, this is Tom. I'll start and then maybe Glenn can add color to that as well. So first, thanks for the question. Good morning.","Based on the three months results, it's too soon to change the underlying combined ratio guidance. The returns we earned on auto insurance are really good even at the outlook range and the best way to increase shareholder value at that point is to grow policies in force. We're obviously, as you point out, at below the low end of the range in the first quarter and that was really due to an unexpected decline in auto accident frequency versus the prior year. It looks like other companies experienced similar declines in the first quarter but our guidance is based on only a really small sample of the overall industry. Our projections did assume that there would be an increase in auto accident frequency. And as you well know, auto accident frequency has been very volatile over the last three years. It increased significantly in 2015 and 2016 and then decreased in 2017. Actually you can see that on John's slide. And, of course, the underlying drivers of frequency are miles driven, economic activity, how many people are working, weather, all of which are difficult to predict individually, in combination and doing it geographically is nearly impossible. And so at this point, we're not changing our frequency outlook for the whole year or our underlying combined ratio guidance. But let me give you a couple of math points as well. Auto frequency is usually highest in the fourth quarter. In the second half of the year, it has three more days than the first half of the year and one calendar day has over half a point of impact on the quarterly loss ratio, all other things being equal. So the returns we get are really good at any level. And so we're focused on maintaining that and growing. Our competitive position, Glenn can talk about it although I would say from my standpoint, the best way to analyze competitive position is your retention levels in your new business, and both are good.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, thanks Tom. And Greg, good question. On competitive position, we feel good about where we are from all the metrics we looked at. We monitor our competitive position in every state and every market across the country. And if you look at how we're growing right now, we're growing in a pretty balanced way. As Tom said, we're retaining more of our customers \u2013 always best to retain the ones we fought hard to attract in the first place and our new business is up. With the new business up, if we were getting the same number of quotes but significantly increasing our close rate, you'd look at it and think that we broadened appetite or something in the way that we got it. But from a competitive standpoint, we're just getting a lot of looks at people. We're getting a lot of quotes. Our quotes are well up. We're closing an appropriate amount of those so our competitive position feels like we're in good shape.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for that answer. Just as a follow-up, I know you mentioned in your comments about your emphasis on your agency and distribution force. And I was looking at some of the statistics on, I guess, it's page 11 of your supplement. And you talk about Allstate agencies, and it looked like it was down sequentially a little bit. License sales agencies, sales professionals and Allstate independent agencies. Maybe you could just provide some color around which of those buckets you expect to grow over the course of the next year or two and which may be deemphasized?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","All right. Yeah, Greg, I'm glad you pointed that out. Because I really think the way to look at this is on a year-over-year basis. We've been committed for several quarters. We've been talking about growing our distribution footprint and I think we are effectively growing the distribution footprint. If you look year-over-year, we're up about 1200 points of presence. 100 agents, 1200 licensed sales professionals. When you look at this, much like a lot of our other results, there's a little bit of a seasonality to it. At the end of the year, a lot of folks are running to get some people in place. The pipeline dries up a little bit. We tend to have higher turnover in the first quarter, but the first quarter of this year, our turnover was less than what we anticipated. So that was favorable. So as you look at a starting point at the end of first quarter last year to now, we got 1200 more points of presence; a little bit down sequentially but we're really always down sequentially at that. We're less down than we would have anticipated at this point. So, as we build throughout the year and we continue to look to increase our distribution footprint, we're starting from a good foundation.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I guess, first, I was hoping \u2013 could you just elaborate a bit on what drove the unexpected decline in auto frequency and do you have any view on what that could look like going forward?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sarah, this is Tom. So, it's really too early to tell what the drivers of it would be. When we look at a variety of items, there's no one thing that pops out in your mind. Obviously, weather would have some impact in the first quarter and there is different kinds of weather in different parts of the country.","Secondly, when we look at miles driven, it's actually up a little bit when we look at our driveway data so that wouldn't automatically lead you to conclude that it should be down. In fact, it would be the opposite of that so we don't have a good read now. And oftentimes even in reverse-looking at 2015 and 2016, it's hard to determine attribution between specific elements. What we do know is that it was down and obviously we've reserved well so we're feeling good about where the profitability of the business is but we also know that if it goes up, we're still positioned to be very attractive returns in the business.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on the performance-based investment income that declined quarter-over-quarter, how should we be thinking about modeling a good run rate for that?","John Edward Dugenske - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. Hi, Sarah, it's John Dugenske. Thank you for asking the question. First, I wouldn't view the quarterly decline as meaningful. If you think about how we own these assets generally, we own these sets versus longer-tailed liabilities. The performance has been consistent with what we've hoped to achieve with the allocation over time.","Looking at a little more detail, in any given quarter, you may get a specific event, a transaction where something's liquidated, a particular performance of an individual investment that may make those returns a little bit volatile. I would encourage you to smooth the data and look at multiple quarters and look at the overall trend. Notably in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a number of very positive events. Three liquidations of deals that just as well could have taken place this quarter but took place in the fourth quarter that gave us a very good fourth quarter number along with some other things. So, overall, the trend is in place and we feel good about it.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, just in terms of modeling that, $200 million or so is a good run rate?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Sarah, you might look at it as on a yield basis and on a rolling basis. So \u2013 I know that's hard to stick into a quarterly number but John is being a little humble. We had great results in quarters 2, 3 and 4 last year that the yield on their portfolio, if you just took income over the balance was in the mid-teens, but we do not...","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Expect it to be in the mid-teens on that kind of level. We expect it to be above where you would get from public equities, so I think you really have to look at it on that basis (28:29) and we tend to think about it relative to the overall company in terms of volatility. I know you're looking at individual lines, but catastrophes bounce around, performance-based income bounces around, what we seek to do is to increase total long-term return despite the fact that it bounces around. In fact that it does bounce around gives us the opportunity. We have the ability to enable and handle that volatility; gives us the ability to earn better returns.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning. Just first question, just a follow-up on the frequency questions. I just wondered if you could quantify the delta between the results versus your expectations?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Kai, we don't give out the subcomponents of our expectations, because then we end up spending a whole bunch of time talking about assumptions which \u2013 on things like frequency, it's always an estimate. It's even harder to look backwards and determine why it happened so we don't give out the subcomponents.","Glenn, maybe you can talk a little bit about the absolute decline in frequency and where we saw it and that will give Kai some additional color.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, so we saw \u2013 obviously, we saw the decline in frequency. One way to look at this is as you compare to sort of the broader trends, so we clearly have wind at our backs when it comes to frequency; it's down. Our frequency appears to be down as you look over the last few quarters, a little more than the industry and some of that is as our book shrunk a little bit, we got to a little bit higher quality on average of the book of business.","In terms of just longer-term trends, there's a lot it, as Tom said, it's hard to predict. There's a lot of different theories on there between miles driven, miles driven per operator, safety features in cars, so we'll continue to monitor that going forward.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","So, yeah and I think, Glenn, it's very broad-based geographically decline in frequency this quarter by accident-type. It was down in most of the accident types. The tenure of the customer was down across all tenures of customers so it wasn't just one state, one group of customers. It was broad-based, which, as Glenn said, leads us to conclude that other people had the same thing but we don't know that for sure.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just to clarify, you still expect positive frequency through the remaining of the year?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Kai, we haven't changed our underlying combined ratio outlook for the year, would be the way I would say that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then my second question is on more sort of a like high-level. If you \u2013 there's a recent IPO on the personal line brokerage and they're looking into sort of growing very rapidly in the multicarrier platform independent agency model. You \u2013 Allstate have the platform that encompass all these different distribution model but the captive agency distribution is still the majority of the revenue as well as income. How do you feel about the captive model over the long run?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","We like the Allstate agency model for a number of reasons. First, it gives us the ability to have the right price value comparison. When you're in the independent agency channel, you often get spreadsheeted (32:02) comparative rater and it's harder to maintain consistency in your pricing.","Secondly, the captive channel gives us the ability to really control the customer experience, which is really important when you're delivering value. And as we head into telematics, it gives us an ability to build even greater relationships because people will be more connected with us. That said, we think there is a place in our portfolio for all the businesses. So we like to do it direct with Esurance. We'd like to grow Encompass. We wanted to get its profitability right and get its capabilities positioned which is I mentioned we're working on. So we'd like to grow in that channel as well.","And, of course, we have a platform which we believe is the biggest in the industry right now, called Answer Financial, which is an electronic version of an independent agency. And it's got a very strong position and we're continuing to build up that model, leaning into telematics on that piece as well.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. As the Allstate brands auto policies in force are now growing, how can the company make sure it doesn't become impacted by the new business penalty where the margins for the new business tend to be somewhat lower than legacy business?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, Jay, you're correct in that, particularly in the preferred customer segment, there tends to be a new business penalty where you earn less money on a new customer than you would on somebody who has been around for seven or eight years. And so that is basically endemic to the industry and of growth. What I would say is I would maybe take your question \u2013 it's really not possible not to be impacted by that. But what I would say is we feel comfortable that we know how to manage growth and overall profitability to be able to increase shareholder value by both growing and maintaining margins.","And Glenn mentioned this. We run the business at a local level. So we're looking at it by state, by product line, by risk class. We slice and dice it every which way, so to the extent that the growth would not be properly priced in certain places, we would obviously be able to \u2013 we'd see that and would react accordingly. And then I would also say the increasing use of telematics also helps us get even more accurate in our pricing.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. On the investment side, I guess I was a little surprised that the market base, essentially the fixed income investment portfolio, investment income that that generates was down year-over-year and then also versus the prior quarter. I thought with higher interest rates, that could be rising. What am I missing there?","John Edward Dugenske - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, Jay, it's John again, thanks for the question. I would encourage you to take a look at the portfolio as a whole and think about how income has been generated that way. There are a number of dynamics going on in market base.","First, as our performance-based assets increase, our market-based assets decrease. So there's just a lower base by which it can generate income.","Second, the asset mix, within our market-based assets, changes. So, generally, we've used high-yield and other higher yielding assets within market-based to fund our performance-based assets. So, lower balance and lower high-yielding assets will decrease that. Another thing to think about is just how does the book react to higher interest rates? Think about Allstate, real simply, it's two different. Our Life and Annuities business, which generally tends to be liability-matched and where there's not a lot of new purchases. The turnover is very low. That doesn't react very quickly. Even within our protection businesses, only a small part of the portfolio would roll over in any period of time, therefore it only captures an interest rate rise gradually throughout the year.","I can give you further statistics on that, but a real rough gauge would be if interest rates moved up 100 basis points across the course of the year, given turnover and everything else, expecting no other changes in the portfolio, we'd expect our yield to move up by 6 basis points or roughly $45 million to $50 million in net income.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's really helpful. Thanks very much for that. And then, just finally \u2013 I just wanted to recognize I think this is the first quarter since 2007 the company has generated over $1 billion in operating income. And at the same time, the share count has been reduced by 40%, so keep up the good work.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Thank you, Jay. I would hear that and I'm...","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I have two unrelated questions. The first one is, there \u2013 and it's not going to be \u2013 (37:29) actually, there's a lot of private equity and other folks looking to buy blocks of Annuities, do you have any additional thoughts on your own Annuity (sic) [Annuities] (37:43) and Life book and would you be interested or you thought about some of this increased demand for people to buy some of these blocks?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","That's a really good question, Paul. The returns on capital are low for the payout annuity block versus the deferred annuity block, so we split it into two chunks. And the payout annuity block backs a lot of structured settlements, really long-dated liabilities and it is underperforming. Our approach with all of our underperforming business as you know has been to go at it multiple ways to be proactive, but to take action. And that block is about $12 billion so we're doing the same thing that we've done on all of our businesses.","So just if you go back and go up a little bit, we transferred the VA block versus reinsurance in 2006. At first, we got lucky and that was before the financial markets crashed. We shut down sales of new annuities over a period of years. (38:48), so we've taken a variety of actions. What we've been doing on this one is first and foremost, getting the investments correct, so that rather than funding this block with fixed income, we've been funding portions after seven years with payout annuity or with performance-based which generates a much bigger return. That generates more capital for us and makes it less underperforming on a long-term basis. What it does on a short term basis is it makes it even more underperforming because you have to put up a whole bunch of capital for those equities even though you really shouldn't have to because the risk is big in equities, it's actually lower than the risk of being in fixed income for a long-dated liability. So what we've been doing is working with the NAIC to reduce the capital requirements and we made some progress to them to the extent we can do that, that will enable us to free up some capital. At the same time, we're also looking at how we structure those investments so we may be able to structure them in different ways so they don't have to carry as much capital.","Obviously, as interest rates go up, that should help that portfolio and the lower tax rate is obviously also increased value so we've improved value in that block. We have things to do to further improve it but we're not done. And, of course, our goal is to maximize our economic value per shareholder, so we'll continue to look at all different ways to do that.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","My second question is has there been any change on a regulatory front for the insurance business in your opinion?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","For insurance, I missed that last part, Paul?","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Just any change in the regulatory environment in the insurance business?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, that's a broad question. I would say there are a couple of things from a regulatory environment that we're all looking at. One is cybersecurity. The New York Department of Financial Services put out some new cybersecurity rules. We're all working hard; we would work hard anyway to make sure we're protected but we're working to make sure we have the specific elements in those specific regulations covered.","Secondly, there's always the issue of privacy in data. And you're starting to see it is not yet in insurance but we're thinking about how would we deal with increased requirements on it. So as it relates to pricing, claims and a variety of things, I would say it's business as usual. Glenn, do you agree with that?","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah, I agree. There was a lot of discussion last quarter about with the tax changes and everything, but we continue to work with regulators on state-by-state basis and our filing process is business as usual.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Allstate. Question on where we are in the competitive landscape which you sort of spoke about. As we look to the rest of the year, it looks like the industry came in maybe 3 points better in 2017 and your key competitors were around 103 (42:13). But if you take Allstate and Progressive out, they were at 106 (42:18). So we're trying to sort of handicap or I'm trying to handicap how your mutual competitors and travelers in Progressive are going to take the rate actions over the balance of the year. It looks like you're competing and winning on the margin but are we looking at rate increases to be more moderate by your competitors and where do you think the world is going, rate-wise?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","We don't know, Bob. I can't tell you what everybody else's plans are. We see the same numbers you see and perhaps at a greater level of granularity. So, we look at Progressive, Geico, State Farm, not only in total but by state, by risk class. We think some of that group still has some \u2013 if we were them, we would be increasing prices. I don't know what they will do given that we are not them but Glenn can talk about our rate outlook for the future, which is modest.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah. If you look at our \u2013 where we are now, it's always dangerous to talk about this in a global level, because as Tom said, it really is state-by-state. We have great need in some places and we don't in others. Broadly-speaking, we're clearly in a better pricing and rate situation than we were a couple of years ago. I would also caution you, as you think about that, Bob, to look at what happened from the last year because a lot of what is in the results this year is what rates they took last year. So when you look at whether it's the CPI and compare to how rates are coming in in auto insurance in the first quarter, it really is the rates that were taken over the last 12 months. And so a lot of this year is already baked from whatever folks did last year in their rates and what they do this year is really more of a forward-looking basis.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","It looks like you and Progressive's margin \u2013 underwriting margin versus the industry just continues to widen year after year. I think I had it at 12 points for the two of you versus the industry last year. Is it technology pricing? You got the rates up right? What do you think sort of explains how your margin versus the industry continues to widen on a neutral basis?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, I think, Bob, when you look over a long period of time, Progressive, Allstate and Geico, our combined ratios look to be about the same and much better than the industry. The 12 points seems like a bigger gap to me than I've seen versus the industry. But we have traditionally been at about the same zone. I think that's, in part, pricing accuracy. I think it's a different view as to what return on capital we want to get on the business, so mutual companies have a different view as to what their capital objective function is, and I think we're effective and efficient the way we do it. That would be auto insurance.","What I would say on homeowners insurance is we appear to be substantially better than other people in the industry, and I don't think there's many companies with our size and scale that generate the kind of income we have. And if you look at the slide John showed, it's over $900 million of income from underwriting of our homeowners business in the last 12 months, and it's been pretty consistent like that for five or six years. So I would not ignore the benefits that we generate from being in the homeowners business.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, thank you. So looking at the growth rates of Allstate brand and Esurance, obviously Esurance is a much smaller base but there's a lot of natural growth in direct. I would have thought you'd be adding policies in direct at this point in time, right now, given that I assume the pricing metrics you have around both distribution channels are similar. Why is the Allstate brand channel growth here than direct? Is there a theory behind that or is it just times change and different products sell better at different times?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","First, I don't think there are \u2013 you're appealing to different customers, different geography bases and therefore different competitive environment. We feel good about the Allstate brand business and that's really been coming. As Glenn said, we expanded distribution all through last year. You didn't see it in any of last year's numbers but you see it this quarter and we would expect that growth to continue in terms of the distribution and hopefully that will turn into growth in items in force. So Esurance, slightly different position. Its growth is really driven by expansion and homeowners, but we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow Esurance. Well, you just didn't see it this quarter. So I think both businesses, we would expect to grow items in forces as we go forward from here.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sometimes I tell people it's hard to tell why stocks are going to go up in the future as what's explained what they did in the past and I think you've talked around this but I hope you can answer the question better than me. We have enough time, half the 2015 frequency spike and now we are in a frequency, I don't even know what you're going to call it right now \u2013 levels (47:59) are lower than they were before the spike back then. I think you touched upon it but I'm hoping that maybe you have a little better color. Is there a grand theory about why frequency went up three years ago and maybe another grand theory about why it seems to be coming down right now?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","As a grand theory, it makes it sound like there's like one reason, so no. I would say \u2013 so, look, frequency came down for a long, long period of time because we had third tail light, anti-drunk driving laws, three cars per household versus two drivers, anti-lock brakes, there's a whole variety of things that happened and then it kind of leveled out for a period of time \u2013 maybe five or six years. And then in 2015 and 2016, it spiked up. Some of that was obviously related to economic activity \u2013 more people back at work, because about a third \u2013 if you look at where people drive their cars, a third is to work, a third is on errands, a third is for leisure, so they were driving more to work and if you have more money, you do more leisure. And so miles driven went up so people got more accidents. Some people would say it was somewhat related to distracted driving. I think that's impossible to predict because you're talking about knowing whether somebody was looking at their phone or just put their phone down right before they got in an accident. That information just is not available so people are looking at results and trying to come up with conclusions as to why it might be that way. What we do know is that it went up and we had react. It went up for two years in a row. We increased our prices to account for it. It came down last year and I think the clarity on that is as far as the increase, which is we just know it went down and that puts us in a better profit position in getting to see opportunity to grow. It's down this quarter, but I don't think you should take that to a trend. I think frequency bounces around a lot and when we give our underlying combined ratio guidance, it's because it does bounce around a lot. It had nothing to do with our view on the economics of the business. We earn really high economic rents from our customers because we do a really good job for them and we do that when our competitors don't, so it's not like we're taking advantage of anybody. We're just good at what we do and we think that auto business is a good profit generator and a growth vehicle as it will be in the future, irrespective of what happens to frequency.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, good luck and let frequency be low for everyone, drivers and companies.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones, I think. So looking at the 17% year-over-year growth in new issued applications in Allstate brand auto, did you see momentum accelerate there over the quarter? Did it decelerate? Was it roughly constant?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","The 17% year-over-year growth in new business, Glenn, the question was...","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Yeah.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","...did it accelerate? You're getting into monthly numbers, which we don't disclose.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.","Well, so thanks, Yaron. First of all, the growth came in pretty balanced way. We got growth across a lot of different states. We got growth in areas that we targeted that we wanted growth. We invested in local marketing. What I would say is that it's been pretty balanced and pretty healthy in that the whole system is responding right now. As Tom mentioned, we've talked about for a few quarters, the fact that we're trying to grow our distribution system, but also make it more effective. So, I'd say one, it's growing. I mentioned that before \u2013 1,200 more points of sale out there and less turnover. Two, the system is more efficient. We've got quotes per agent up, new business per agent across the country up.","We're serving our customers' needs more broadly because we're selling across the system more so even \u2013 I know you're talking about the 17% in auto, but we're up 15% new business in home, too. So we're selling across the system more effectively. And then, and I think maybe most importantly, the system is investing in itself right now. Agents feel good. Everywhere I go across the country, agents are positive. They're feeling good about their opportunity, their economic opportunity in the system. They're marketing in their local environments. They're hiring staff and leaning in, so all of those elements are really driving pretty broad growth.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is around prior-year development. So, the adjustment for the company's bodily injury claims handling has clearly been a positive for favorable prior-year development. How much longer do you think this favorable tailwind continues? And then are there other initiatives in place or on the way that could lead to lower losses or more efficient reserving?","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Yeah, hi this is Mario. So I'd say, look, we are continually looking at our reserve balances across all coverages and we feel really good about where our reserve position is. Because of some of the things we've done on the claim side to manage, particularly the injury coverages we've seen, some favorable development over the last several quarters, I would tell you it's \u2013 I'm not going to sit here and predict whether that will continue or not. I will tell you we'll continue to look at reserves.","And claims, I think is a process that's a moving target. You always want to get better in your claim handling. And when we talk about continuous improvement, that's really an area where continually reinventing ourselves in how we handle claims is really a critical part of our business model. And we've been pretty successful at that historically. And I think that's what's generated some of the equity you've seen in our reserve position, but we feel good about reserves. We'll keep looking at them. And it's hard to predict whether they'll continue to favorably develop at the same pace.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the capital side of things. You guys issued debt in some preferreds in the quarter. Can you just update us is this part of just normal adding to your leverage? Do you see yourselves as you using this for your buyback or is there maybe a component of having some capital flexibility for future acquisitions built in there? And then, if there is a component of flexibility for acquisitions, if you could just update us on some things that you might be thinking about in terms of that could be additive to the Allstate profile?","Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.","Thanks, Elyse. This is Mario. So I guess where I'd start is we feel really good about our capital position. We got a really strong capital position overall. And having said that, we're always looking for ways to optimize our capital structure, and what you really saw in the first quarter was an opportunity to issue securities at attractive levels, both from a senior debt perspective as well as perpetual preferred stock, which we view as really a permanent part of our capital structure.","So we did the issuances. We're going to use the proceeds to pay down some debt that's maturing in May and also call some junior subordinated debt that had lost equity credit that, on a floating rate basis, had a relatively higher coupon. So we're going to do that. So we're going to swap out some debt or some of the debt that we just issued at more attractive rates.","And then we have the opportunity \u2013 and we haven't decided on this yet, we have the opportunity to call some of our preferred stock later in the year and we took the opportunity to issue again what we view as permanent capital at really attractive levels. And we'll make that decision in terms of what to do with the proceeds going forward, but we feel really good about where we're at from a capital perspective and we really like the flexibility that gives us, both to invest in growth in the business and look for other opportunities that might come along.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","And with our capital position earnings power, we don't need to prefund anything to do an acquisition. We don't need to go out and raise money in advance to try and do something. If we wanted to do something, we would just fund it at that point in time.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there something, Tom, on your radar screen or it's just dependent upon maybe some things that become available in the market?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","If you look at our track record, we're not averse to buying things but we're kind of picky. And it's got be related to our strategy and it has to be a good company. So, SquareTrade, which we bought a little over a year ago, was related to our strategy to insure more things for people, particularly the electronic items that they have. And Don might want to just comment on how we've done relative to that. But we said we're thoughtful about it. Other places we might look would be to the extent we could expand other lines of business that could be sold by our Allstate agencies, would be interesting to us. And then as there is always new stuff in the market, so we're not averse to it, but I don't have like a list of here's five companies we have to buy so that we can be strategically sound. We're in a really good position.","Don, maybe you just want to mention about SquareTrade?","Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.","Yes. Look, the first full-year is behind us now. As I'm sure you were all thinking about a year ago, a lot can go wrong when you do an acquisition. We laid out three objectives for the acquisition. I'm happy to say we're hitting all of them. The first was growth and you can see again this quarter continued growth, both in policies and in premiums. Second was to be able to improve the returns in the business. And as Mario mentioned, we've taken more of the underwriting in-house, but on top of that the loss ratios are running well and the company is just performing well from the profitability point of view. The third was to improve their growth opportunities outside U.S. retail which is where the main business is and they've done a really nice job in that. The European business, albeit a little under 10% of their total book has nearly doubled in the last quarter.","So, the three objectives we've set, I feel like we're hitting all of them. If you remember when we did the acquisition, we said we chose SquareTrade because they were service-obsessed and that fit well with the way we want to treat our customers. Having met with a number of their existing and prospective customers, I can tell you they are really good at onboarding and serving their end-customers and creating value for the retailer. So I feel like we made the right choice. I'm glad we did it and if we had that choice again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Let me just add one other piece here. So when we talk retailers, that's both electronic and big-box.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just really quickly on SquareTrade, there was a $30 million boost to the topline from the accounting change in the quarter. Was there any impact from that accounting change on the bottom line earnings in the quarter?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","No. It was net neutral to income. It was just the revenue impact from the accounting change.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John Griek - The Allstate Corp.","Jonathan, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please.","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, very quickly, just going back to the questions on the unexpected decline in frequency, should investors brace for a time when we would have an unexpected reversal in frequency too? Is that sort of the takeaway in constantly reminding us that this frequency is an outlier? How should we think about that?","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Amit, I think you brace for things when something bad is going to happen to you. What I would say is our auto business is very profitable. It would be very profitable and we should be growing it even if we were at a combined ratio that was 86% to 88%, which is our annual outlook. And so what I think investors should be excited about is the fact that we have a business that is very profitable; that business is starting to grow and that should add, increase shareholder value when it was getting smaller over the last couple of years as we improved this profitability. So we no longer need to do that, so we're on the offensive now beginning to grow that business and I think that's what investors should be focused on versus \u2013 this is not just a profit machine, it's a shareholder value machine. We have auto insurance, we have home insurance, we've got our performance-based stuff, we've got Life business and Benefits, we've got SquareTrade and all of those things create incremental value for our shareholders and are consistent with our strategy. So I think to get too focused on one specific measure is just the wrong way to think about investing in our company. That's not the way we run the company. We run the company for long-term shareholder value and so I wouldn't brace for anything. I'd be looking forward and being optimistic about the amount of money we're making in this business and how we can grow it.","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. But the only other quick question I have is on the pricing discussion. And we didn't spend time on discussing the rate trends which you've shown on page 18 of the supplement. How should we think about, I guess, the trajectory of the rate filings from here? And thanks for fitting me in.","Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.","Well, we've talked about this before. Given the kind of combined ratios we have, you shouldn't expect to see big increases in the topline on an average premium standpoint but we'll make up for that, in part, by growing the business. So I would just say, don't get too focused on the one measure of performance on one line for the entire company. This is a large corporation. We got lots of ways in which we make money and add value to our customers. All of those did really well in the first quarter or better than we expected. And even if they had been at the level we expected it, it still would have been a great quarter. So, I feel like there's \u2013 don't get too focused on one item really; think about the whole value creation and we've got lots of value to create by growing the business at really attractive returns. So, thank you all. We're off to a good start. We look forward to talking to you in second quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's third quarter earnings conference call. First, Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and I will provide some color on our results for the quarter. And then we'll go into a question-and-answer period. Also on the call are Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies. Don Bailey, who leads the Emerging Businesses, will not be able to join us today since he's on the East Coast a result of Superstorm Sandy.","Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement and filed our 10-Q for the third quarter. We also posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website.","Beginning with Slide 1, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. The actual results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the third quarter 2012 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. And I will be available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom for his perspective on our performance.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, good morning. We appreciate you spending time with us today.","Before we discuss results, let me say a few words about Hurricane Sandy, which I know personally affected many of you. First, I hope you all are getting your lives back together. As you know, this was a massive storm affected most of the Eastern half of the country. If you look on Slide 2, you can see the breadth of that.","Putting it in comparison to other events, this is at least twice the breadth of Hurricane Katrina. The good news is that the wind speeds were substantially lower than Katrina and more like last year's Hurricane Irene. In fact, the winds speeds were about 2\/3 of Katrina. And as you know, the damage is exponential as that speed goes up. And while it's, of course, too early to call ultimate damages, several modelers have put out insured loss estimates, Eqecat's at $5 billion to $10 billion, AIR's at $7 billion to $15 billion, with economic losses at twice that amount. If the storm's damage is over $8 billion in insured losses, that will make it the fifth-largest hurricane in U.S. history.","Of course, a lot of the damage at this point would appear to be caused by flooding. That is covered by your auto insurance. As you know, the federal government provides flood insurance, and it's typically not covered by people's homeowners insurance.","And of course, in these times of trouble -- that's when our company, Allstaters, do great work on behalf of our customers. We have 1,100 catastrophe claim adjusters out in the field as we speak; another 500 at our service centers. We have 24 mobile claim centers. We're reaching out to customers. We're doing advertising. We're walking the neighborhoods. We are very proud of the fact that we are either among the first, if not the first, to be there for our customers, and it's sort of a point of pride for us. We're out there helping them find a place to live, get food and clothing, assess their losses. And Allstaters really do an amazing job of providing for the needs of our customers, being empathetic and supportive at this time.","As you know, our customer focus is central to our strategy. In fact, we've just got the J.D. Power Auto Claims Satisfaction results this week, and our overall satisfaction on auto claims increased significantly. We're now in the high satisfaction tier, above the industry average and several other well-known insurance brands.","Now we all want to know, of course, how this storm -- much this storm will ultimately cost us, and it's obviously too early to estimate the impact of that storm. However, the catastrophe is not expected to have a material impact on our overall financial condition. Obviously, at this time, our focus is on our customers, not our monetary losses. Ultimately, of course, we do provide an estimate for cat losses in 1 month if it surpasses $150 million. We typically do that by the third Thursday of the following month. Because this event occurred at the end of a month and it involves such extensive damage, we may not have enough information to develop a credible estimate by November 15. This way that Thursday falls is really 15 days after the end of the month. But as soon as we have an estimate, we'll put one out.","Now let's move on to discuss results for the quarter. I'll focus my remarks on our performance relative to our 2012 priorities. And then Bob and Steve will cover the quarterly results in greater detail.","So moving to Slide 3. Our strategy, of course, is to provide unique products to each of the 4 customer segments in the marketplace, which you can see on the top there, and it is working. The Allstate brand serves those customers who prefer to purchase competitively priced branded products and want local advice and counsel. In this business, we've introduced several new differentiated products including Claim Satisfaction Guarantee, Drive Wise, Good Hands Roadside and House & Home.","In the third quarter, premium and unit growth continued to be impacted negatively by our efforts to improve homeowner returns broadly across the country and our actions to improve profitability in a few large auto states, which as you know, we started last year. We did see positive premium growth in total for the Allstate brand as homeowners, Emerging Businesses and standard auto outside of New York and Florida all contributed to that increase.","Additionally, Allstate Financial's new issued life policies sold through the Allstate agencies to the customers in this segment increased as well. And of course, we continued to look for ways to improve the growth trajectory for standard auto, one of our core lines, identifying market opportunities to expand homeowners and Emerging Businesses and then support our agencies so that they can grow their business profitably.","In the self-directed segment, that prefers a branded experience, that's served by Esurance, that's on the lower right. Since they reported last October, Esurance has exceeded our growth expectations, with policies in force increasing 22% since the beginning of this year. The GAAP combined ratio remained elevated, as one would expect, given the amount of new business we're writing and the way the accounting works for direct businesses. We are closely watching the loss ratio since maintaining auto profitability is one of our core priorities.","Our progress is also evident in the advice in brand neutral customer segment, that's up top, served by Encompass. The growth and profit trends for that brand are also positive.","If you move to Slide 4. Let's review our financial performance for the third quarter. On a consolidated basis, we generated $723 million in net income and improved underlying margins and lower catastrophe losses while growing premiums. Operating income of $717 million converts to $1.46 per diluted share, and that's our best quarterly results in 5 years.","Our book value per share grew to $42.64 per share, that's 22.4% better than the third quarter of 2011. And lastly, we produced a return on equity of 13.6% and 15% on a net income and operating income basis, respectively. That is on a trailing 12-month basis.","Now I recognize we set a goal of 13% operating income return by 2014. Keep in mind that while we make good progress on improving the profitability of the business, the weather has been fairly good over the last 12 months, so there's more work to be done before we feel like we've achieved that goal.","We also established 4 priorities for 2012, and we are on pace to achieve all of them. Maintaining auto margins is critical. The underlying combined ratio in the quarter was 93.7, that's an improvement from the third quarter of 2011. The homeowners' underlying combined ratio improved 7 points as rates continue to work into the P&L and then the weather remained relatively benign and the benefit of our underwriting actions. This is a result of 5 years of hard work to reposition this business.","Annuity returns remained relatively flat and the reduction in contractholder funds was lower due primarily to the low interest rate environment. Going forward, we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate that reduction.","Property-Liability insurance premiums grew 5% from the third quarter of 2011, largely due to the acquisition of Esurance. Both the Allstate brand and Encompass produced positive premium growth rates in the quarter. And at customer segments served by the Allstate Agencies, however, auto and homeowner policies, declined. Reversing this trend is a key priority for Matt's team. But Don Bailey's team has done a nice job of repositioning Encompass and growing the roadside business with a new product. Good Hands Roadside now has over 750,000 members. We actually changed the disclosure in the investor supplement to see the policies in force in a slightly different way this quarter.","The Allstate Financial team, led by Don Civgin, is growing life sales through Allstate Agencies and the Benefits business.","Judy's team continues to proactively manage the investment portfolio, which led to solid total return performance of 2.4% in the quarter and 6.3% through September. Net investment income of $940 million declined 5.4% from last year's third quarter. And that's primarily due to reduced Allstate Financial liabilities, lower yields, which of course we're all familiar with, and then limited partnership results were down a little bit this quarter as well. The portfolio net unrealized gain increased in value during the quarter to $5.7 billion at the end of September.","Now from a capital utilization perspective, we repurchased $153 million of our stock, and that's at a slower rate than in the previous quarter. As we said, in the third quarter as we moved through cat season, we tend to slow that program down a little bit.","We feel good about the results for the year but also recognize there's a lot more work to be done. So let's hear from Bob and Steve.","Robert Block","Thanks, Don. Let's take a closer look at the details for Property-Liability and Allstate Financial for the third quarter. Beginning with Property-Liability on Slide 5, we show both the top line and combined ratio results. Overall written premium grew 5% from the third quarter 2011 to $7.06 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Esurance. The growth rate increased from the second quarter 2012 as both the Allstate and Encompass brands also contributed to the positive result.","Looking at the results by line, Allstate brand standard auto declined by 0.2% from the third quarter 2011, and it was similar to the second quarter 2012. Excluding New York and Florida, the 2 states where we have implemented significant profit improvements over the last 18 to 24 months, Allstate brand standard auto grew by 1.4%.","New issued applications of 460,000 remained slightly below the prior year, but we're at the average level produced over the last 6 quarters, which ranged from 451,000 to 472,000. The retention ratio remained at 89.0%, down 0.10% from the third quarter 2011. Policies in force declined sequentially as the level of new business was not sufficient to offset the renewal losses","Allstate brand homeowners' net written premium of $1.69 billion increased 3.2% compared to the third quarter of 2011. The favorable impact of rate changes on average premium more than offset the decline in units. We continued to see great changes in order to achieve our stated return goals.","In addition, we are rolling out our new product, House & Home, now in 17 states, including 5 states that rolled out in the month of October.","Encompass continued to show positive results in both premiums and units, with increases over prior year of 5.3% and 3.8%, respectively. Esurance contributed $282 million in premiums written during the third quarter and increased units sequentially to 962,000, a 22.4% gain since the beginning of the year.","On the bottom half of the slide, we provide the combined ratio results for Property-Liability and by brand on a recorded and underlying basis. The recorded combined ratio for Property-Liability was 90.2, significantly better than the prior year due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and an improvement in the underlying combined ratio.","Year-to-date September, the underlying combined ratio was 87.4 or 1.5 points better than prior year and below the bottom of the outlook range we provided at the beginning of 2012 of 88 to 91. If we matched the underlying combined ratio we recorded in the fourth quarter of last year of 90.7, it would put us in the lower end of that range. Now this is not a prediction or a forecast, just creating some context for why we didn't adjust the range at this time.","During the third quarter, we completed our annual comprehensive review of the discontinued lines and coverages reserves. We made some minor adjustments to the reserves for an impact of $42 million.","The recorded combined ratio results by brand indicates significant improvement for both the Allstate and Encompass brands due primarily to reduced catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio also improved for the Allstate brand and Encompass. For Esurance, the recorded and underlying combined ratios remained elevated.","On Slide 6, we provide charts detailing loss trends, rate changes and combined ratio for Allstate brand's standard auto. As shown in the upper left-hand corner, after increasing over prior year in the second quarter, gross frequencies for both bodily injury and property damage declined 1.2% from the third quarter 2011.","In the upper right-hand chart, the calendar year paid severity results for property damage showed a little acceleration from second quarter, increasing 3.9%. Bodily injury calendar year paid severity rose to 6.8% increase over the third quarter of 2011. The bodily injury severity tends to be volatile from period to period, and the mix of state and report years contributes to it. But over a 2-year period, the increase is in line with inflationary factors. There's some pressure on the most recent report years, primarily in New York and Florida. However, the overall loss trends remained well within our pricing actions.","In the lower left hand chart, we provide the approved rate changes for the last 4 years. For the last 4 quarters, we've averaged about 3% in standard auto rate changes. And the lower right-hand chart displays the combined ratio trends since the beginning of 2010. And over the last few years, the combined ratios remained very consistent in the mid-90s range.","Slide 7 looks at the underlying combined ratio trend on the top of the page and the underlying margin components on the bottom of the page for standard auto. In the top chart, you see that we've averaged in the underlying combined ratio of 95.1 over the last 4 quarters. Now on the bottom the page, you can observe that the average earned premium, which is the red line, has remained above the average losses line, shown in blue, meaning that the margins are getting a little better each quarter. Maintaining auto margins remains a top priority for us.","On Slide 8, we provide similar statistics for homeowners. In the upper left, we have approved rate changes for the last 5 years. And over the last 4 quarters, we've received approvals for almost 7% rate increases on a countrywide basis. We will continue to seek needed rate changes in order to hit our return objectives for this line of insurance.","In the upper right, loss cost trends, excluding catastrophe losses, are displayed. For the third quarter, frequency decreased 11.4%, while paid severity increased 5.8%. These results led to a reduction in the underlying combined ratio of 7.1 points, as shown in the lower left. We continue to believe that about 1\/2 of the improvement in the underlying results is sustainable and 1\/2 of the results of the milder weather.","On Slide 9, we provide -- or Slide 9 provides a better look at the underlying loss trends for homeowners. The top chart gives the underlying combined ratio and one can observe the improvement we've achieved in the last several quarters.","On the bottom, we display the trends for the average earned premium and average losses over time. The trend for the average earned premium, in red, reflects the favorable impact of rates increasing steadily since 2010. The trend for losses, in blue, was far below the prior year's and gives rise to our hesitation to take full credit for the margin improvement we've enjoyed this year. That said, improving homeowners' returns is a priority for 2012, and we have been successful thus far through the first 9 months.","Now turning to Allstate Financial, where we continued to shift the focus to underwriting products and away from spread-based ones, the results reflect successful execution of this strategy. Total premiums and contract charges of $563 million increased 2% in total and 3.6% for underwritten products. Allstate Agency life unit sales contributed to this results, increasing 6.9% over the third quarter 2011.","Consistent with the strategy of reducing spread-based products, contractholder funds were reduced by $722 million from the second quarter and $2.2 billion from year end 2011. Given the low interest rate environment, we've not made as much progress in reducing annuity liabilities as we would have liked, and we continued to explore a variety of options to execute this strategy.","Net income for Allstate Financial was $131 million for the third quarter, down $61 million from the third quarter 2011. The primary reasons for this reduction were realized capital losses in 2012 versus realized capital gains in 2011, along with lower operating income results. Last year, we executed a sales program designed to harvest gains accounting for much of the difference.","Operating income was $97 million for the quarter. During this quarter, we completed our comprehensive review of assumptions for deferred policy acquisition, or DAC, deferred sales inducement costs and secondary guarantee liability balances. This resulted in a $27 million pretax charge to income. In 2011, we conducted this review in the first quarter of the year, resulting in a $6 million pretax charge to income.","Looking at the operating returns by line, life insurance declined 2.2 points to 9% from year end 2011, due to worse mortality experienced in the last several quarters and the impact of the annual DAC unlock study. Accident and health continued to produce solid returns at 16.6% as of September 2012.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thanks, Bob. We continued to proactively balance portfolio yield and return objectives in this challenging low interest rate environment, delivering strong investment results with a total portfolio return on a GAAP accounting basis of 2.4% for the quarter and 6.3% to the first 9 months of the year.","On Slide 11, you can see longer term trends in the composition of our portfolio. We ended the third quarter at $93 billion in amortized cost and a fair value of $99 billion, reflecting improved valuations, which along with portfolio income and improved underwriting cash flows from our Property-Liability business, more than offset the ongoing reduction from Allstate Financial's spread-based business.","The chart on the left-hand side chart of this slide helps to illustrate the results of our proactive steps to enhance the profile of our portfolio from a risk and return perspective. Note that the drop in the portfolio's amortized cost resulted primarily from our planned reductions in Allstate Financial's liabilities.","As we headed into the financial crisis, we proactively reduced financial sector and real estate related exposures while increasing the liquidity of the overall portfolio. Coming out of the crisis, we have favored the strong fundamentals and stability of credit, including high yield, over public equities.","During the most recent quarter, we opportunistically reduced risk by selling $722 million of structured securities, realizing a loss of $119 million. The securities increased in value over the course of the year, justifying the sale into a strong market. Collectivity, these actions have resulted in a strong, well-positioned portfolio.","We have been proactively managing interest rate risks by optimizing our fixed income portfolio's position on the yield curve, focusing on intermediate-term securities. This will reduce reinvestment risk and lessen the sensitivity of our portfolio's value to increases in interest rates.","On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the results of these actions in a scheduled maturity profile to the shift away from the due-after-10-years category. We are contemplating reducing our interest rate risks in our Property-Liability portfolio further by selling additional long-dated securities and reinvesting shorter on yield curve. We expect gains to be realized in the sales and the portfolio yields to decline as these sales and reinvestments are executed over the next several quarters.","If you turn to Slide 12, it highlights our portfolio income and yield trends. For the third quarter of 2012, net investment income was $940 million and total portfolio yield was 44.3%, below both the prior quarter and third quarter of 2011.","You may recall that we prospectively changed our classification of equity method limited partnership results to net investment income when realized capital gains at the beginning of the year, which brought us in line with the reporting practices of other peers.","Although investment income on limited partnerships of $22 million is below the prior year quarter, this income is $177 million higher on a year-to-date basis. The increase reflects the change in classification, as well as an improvement of $50 million in limited partnership performance.","Excluding limited partnership results, the portfolio yield was comparable to last quarter and the third quarter of 2011.","On Slide 13, you can see that we realized losses of $72 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a realized gain of $264 million in the third quarter of 2011.","Our portfolio management actions and other trading activities generated approximately $24 million in net trading losses, including the $119 million loss from the sales of structured securities I mentioned earlier.","Impairment and intent write-downs are $46 million and continued to trend significantly lower than prior year periods. Derivative results in the current year reflect reduced usage as we are managing more of our rate risk in the cash market in portfolio positioning and yield curve. In the third quarter of 2011, interest rate derivative valuation losses reflect the significant decrease in rates in that period.","We finished the quarter in a strong capital position, as shown on Slide 14. Shareholders' equity of $20.8 billion increased $2.5 billion from year end 2011. Statutory surplus rose to $17 billion and deployable assets of the holding company level reached $2.3 billion at the end of the third quarter.","We continued to buy back our stock, purchasing $153 million during the quarter. That leaves $166 million as of quarter end on our current $1 billion buyback authorization.","Our book value per share came in at $42.64, and the strength of our operating performance improved portfolio valuation and active capital management.","Now let's go to the question and answer session.","Robert Block","Okay, Matt, if you can start the Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The question I would ask would -- recognize since you can't comment on an actual estimate, of course, it's way too premature. But you are getting reports of first notice of loss. You're out there in the field talking to customers. You have some sense of the volume of the storm. I'd love to get a sense from these operating metrics sort of where you are, you've -- say, in perspective in relation to Hurricane Irene last year. And then similarly, you probably are starting to get a sense of the mix and composition of the claims that you're actually going to have to adjust. And I'd love to get a sense especially when we think about severity going forward. Is this going to be driven by lots of large total unit losses or are you going to see more sort of modest -- far many, but may be more than previously, but sort of many more sort of smaller losses that are sort of damage to ancillary structures and things like that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, this is Tom. You're correct in saying it's way too early. Even on loss counts, it's a little difficult because sometimes people have cell phones; they can get access to it. Sometimes they don't. I can tell you, we're very busy. We also do, as you know, flood adjusting for the federal government where right through on the flood, we're one of the bigger handlers to the program as well. So we take all of those claims in. Anybody calls this customer, we go out and see him. So it's really too early to tell on either the volume, the mix or the severity. What I can tell you is when we do our estimate, we'll try to give you as much information as we can at that point in time. I can tell you that the -- from a risk management standpoint, we are down in policy counts in all of the affected areas by a reasonably substantial amount. And if you're interested in that, Matt can give you some are details on it. But we are -- the actions we've taken over the last 5 years in places like New York, New Jersey, all up along the East Coast, have produced the policy counts we have there, in the 10% to 30% range. And that will obviously impact what our losses are relative to what they would have been. But what you really want to know is what are they going to be, and I can't give you any more clarity than that.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I certainly understand. The investors, I think, at this point are sort of obviously dealing with modeling firm estimates. I think you guys are sort of sophisticated users of the models, and you've got a lot of your own data and your own perspective over time. I'm wondering what sort of -- to use the phrase, sort of, \"known unknowns\" model errors and sort of historic sort of biases that you think that historically perhaps we've seen that you guys might be watching for as you handicap the estimates themselves? And one topic of conversation, I think that people are curious about is whether this has a possibility of being something like Ike, which ended up going further inland and ended up driving sort of surprising levels of losses with what would have been perceived to be modest wind further inland than typically models would have suggested at the time.","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, maybe I can give you a comment on the models and then a suggestion maybe on how I can help you sort out what you're trying to get as you look to impact on us. If -- we do obviously have our own models. We buy all the models from everybody else and we have our own policy data actually loaded into that so we have a wide range. Matt and his team have done a number of scenarios. It's a really wide range. So that number could be low; it could be higher. What I think we could do to give yourself some comfort as to how big it could be would be look at -- go to the website and put in gross losses into the reinsurance section. It's got the interactive model, which will tell you what the net ought to be. And you can see that at certain levels our reinsurance programs kick in, which caps our exposure. Oh, Bob tells me it's not interactive. Sorry. I guess, the interactive part will be you'll have to sign in. I thought we're a little more sophisticated than that, Josh. Sorry. But Bob can help you.","Steven E. Shebik","We can help you out.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I guess, first time, when I look at the auto results, obviously very good. I think you said it was a 93.7, I think, accident year. But if I add on it to the normal caps, a couple of points, that's high 95s, which again, is a solid result. But I'm wondering can that get better? Can we get that -- in the past, you've obviously seen low 90s, but even in 94, 95, is that possible given rates are starting to improve? Or is 96 kind of the best you can do in the current rate environment?","Thomas J. Wilson","First, I just want to give one point of clarification. The information we provided is calendar year, not accident year. So...","Robert Block","The underlying to that.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","The underlying, sorry.","Thomas J. Wilson","What the underlying says...","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","But the underlying to those [ph] cats, I took the underlying and added 2 points of normal cats to it.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. The way we look at the auto business is it generates really good returns for us, so return on capital at that level -- we've shown some slides before -- depending what you want to assume in terms of capital levels, is in the 20% range, plus or minus. That's a really attractive return on capital. We'd like to grow that business at those kind of returns. So I would rather see us grow it and maintain auto profitability than squeeze a few extra dollars out of margin.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","That actually went into my follow-up, which I was going to ask. How is the outlook for that? I believe there was an internal memo that hit one of the newswires that suggested you're broadening your targets and maybe -- but trying not to seem to be a little bit more optimistic about growth going forward, and certainly with competitors, some of your big competitors having to chase rates to improve their profitability back to what it used to be. It would seem maybe you're in a little bit of a sweet spot here?","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me maybe provide you an overview on growth in total, and then Matt and Don can give you some more detailed perspectives on both the Allstate brand, Esurance and Allstate Financial. I think you have to think about it in total as you think about our strategy. So first, our strategy focused on these 4 segments have competitively differentiated products in those segments targeted to those customers. The largest segment, as you point out, is the advise and brand, focus one, that's served by the Allstate Agencies. The overall policies in force are down there, which is largely as a result of the homeowners' actions we've taken, which was intentional on our part to improve returns in that business. Along with that, standard auto is down a little bit partly due to the homeowners, partly due to New York and Florida. Matt can talk about what his opportunities are there to grow. I think the biggest opportunity is to improve our customer retention, because these new business levels are kind of running about where you expect them to be. We have expanded the disclosure. As I've mentioned earlier, you can see Good Hands Roadside, which serves that segment largely, is up substantially. But we don't count it as a policy since they don't pay us until they actually use it. The advice and brand neutral segment that's served by Encompass, that independent agency is up slightly. We need to recapture some lost market share there. Esurance is that self-served branded segment. We're growing it a rate as fast as we're comfortable with. And then Allstate Financial is growing the life policies sold to that lower left-hand segment and our Benefits business. Matt, do you want to make some comments more specifically to the -- I guess, you are up to standard auto so we could zoom in there.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. It's Matt. I'll comment a little bit first on the some of the drivers. So Tom mentioned our 2 primary drivers that have impacted growth have been our homeowners' return improvement actions and some of the auto profitability issues in New York and Florida. And I'll take it up one higher level and I'll say that I think our fundamental approach to the marketplace is to be very proactive and very disciplined. And sometimes, that creates a first mover disadvantage on us, where we're first to take action, where we see need to do risk mitigation, we're first to take rate where we see emerging environmental and economic trends, and we're first to take proactive action that actually can sometimes impact our growth prospects. So I think you know that we have about 16 states where we're either closed for homeowners' new business or have significant new business restrictions in them. I think Sandy is a good indication of why we did that, and it will prove to have been a good move for us to reduce our exposure in some of these coastal areas. But all of those actions, whether they're profitability actions in New York and Florida on auto or these homeowner actions have an impact on our ability to grow. And as Tom said, you can't take all of these profitability actions. You can't do the non-renewals. You can't do reinspections. You can't tighten underwriting without some impact on our retention, and that is really what we see as our prime opportunity for growth at this point because we think we were early in most of these actions, we were proactive. And as a result, I think we're further along on the timeline, and we are at the point of stabilization, and we are at the point where we are beginning to see pockets of growth. You mentioned broadening the target. We have several growth initiatives out there, including broadening the targets and price optimization work, some additional work to analyze our ability to grow even faster in selected areas. And so, yes, we have those pockets of growth emerging. We have about 20 states right now that had positive year-over-year growth in standard auto. And our hope is over 2013 and 2014, we will dramatically improve that number without losing any of our discipline on the profitability side. So our first mover disadvantage, I think at some point, will work into a first mover advantage, where we will emerge out of this cycle faster than some of our peers and we'll be able to take some of the growth opportunities that are presented to us, which I think are many at this point.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Great. So it sounds like you'll be disappointed if we don't see growth in standard auto for 2013?","Matthew E. Winter","I don't remember saying that exactly, but you draw your own conclusion.","Don Civgin","Ian, it's Don. Let me just give a quick update on Esurance. As Tom said, of course, we acquired Esurance so that we could grow in that self-directed segment in a profitable way. That's been the goal; it's to grow our market share profitability. Since the acquisition, we've done a number of things. We've linked the brands together, so it's Esurance and Allstate company, which has played well. We've clarified their position in the market through their features and their technology. We've developed a new ad campaign, and we've thrown a lot of weight behind the new ad campaign intentionally. And here's how I would characterize where we are today. I think we're very happy with the results we're seeing. The response rate with new quotes is up dramatically. The conversion rate is up; the retention rate is up, I mean, you can see it; over 22% improvement in policies since just the beginning of this year. That's a big number. What you're also seeing, though, is a high combined ratio. Part of that is intentional. The advertising model, the accounting model is such that we have to expense that advertising in the quarter we take it, even though the value of the policy continues to linger on through retention. And so, we are watching the GAAP combined ratio. But I'll be honest, we're more interested in the economic combined ratio. If we're convinced that we're writing good business that will be profitable over its life, and we are, then we're comfortable tolerating the GAAP loss ratio being over 100 for some period of time. We also have a little bit of an elevated loss ratio in the third quarter. Gary and his team are watching it closely. We're working together to make sure that we have all our resources between Allstate and Esurance on-the-job. I'm confident that number will get back in line. But all in all, I'll tell you that the growth prospects for Esurance are going up so far very well, and I think we're very optimistic about the future.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I need some little bit of help on your reinsurance slideshow, given that I can't plug this stuff into a spreadsheet. You gave an example of a hurricane going through New Jersey, which seems to have its own cover. And there's 2 different covers, which I don't quite understand how they interact. But I think you talked about a $700 million type loss working its way down to $200 million net, but maybe if you could just give -- if the number was $10 billion in the 3 states, simply what the gross and the net numbers would play out, that would be helpful.","Robert Block","Bob, I can give you a call back later and we can walk through the steps. The 3 contracts -- the contracts in New Jersey all work together. So it's -- I'll give you rough numbers, but it's about $150 million retention, and then, it's 95% reinsured up to the top of the contract. So we can walk you through that.","Thomas J. Wilson","That's New Jersey.","Robert Block","That's New Jersey property losses only. That does not include auto.","Thomas J. Wilson","Right. And then of course -- and as I said, auto flood is covered, and it's at 21 states. So it's a big storm. But we can help you sort out here.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So if you had a $10 billion sort of loss in the other 2 states, what would the net number be?","Thomas J. Wilson","First, I assume you're talking about $10 billion as the industry level.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Right. Right. Let's say, you had 10% to 12% of that, so $1 billion gross, what would the net be?","Thomas J. Wilson","I think it's highly dependent on the mix of which states and what type of losses. But if you want and you come up with 2 or 3 different scenarios, Bob can show you how those would work through the reinsurance program and you can come up with an estimate on it.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. I think others might be interested in this as well. But on Encompass, it looks like a mini-breakout from what's been a troubled line for a long, long time. I mean, you're growing in premiums and the underlying underwriting is improving. Am I overreacting to this quarter or are you -- do you think you got the horse running the right way around the track?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, I guess -- I would agree. I think, first, this business is a good business for us to be in, serving that customer segment. Second, as you know, that business is probably down $700 million or so in premium over the last 3 or 4 years. And so it's got some room to come back. Some of that, of course, was intentional because we're in places we didn't want to be from a cap management standpoint but there is room to grow that business. Three, we do have new leadership there. Don Bailey has got a new leader in place there. We like the results that he and the team are now driving, so I would hope to be able to see it continue to grow. I'm not sure what breakout is. We all have different assessments of breakout. But I think if you look at what's going on in that customer segment and the companies who serve that segment largely through independent agencies, I think we're well positioned to grow, yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I was referring to the underlying profitability, underlying combined ratio.","Thomas J. Wilson","Oh, breakout in the profitability. Sorry, I thought you meant breakout and growth. Our profitability has gotten better. I like the trends. I don't -- I'd like to see it -- I'd like to see our combined ratios from down low, but I'd like to see the business grow as well. So I don't think we're going to -- this business, as you know -- we've had that business -- shortly after we bought it we took the combined ratio down from 117 down into the low 90s. I don't expect it to get into the low 90s at this point in this cycle, given where our competitors are. But I think it can be better than it is today, and I think the business can grow at the same time.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions here for you. The first one, looking at the slide on the underlying margin trends on the standard auto business, looking at your underlying lost trends and what's going on there. I'm just curious, maybe you can talk about kind of the difference between the paid loss trend in which you're showing here, and the incurred loss trend. Because the paid loss trend appears like in the last couple of quarters has been above where your average earned premium per policy has been.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. Brian, it's Matt. So you have all the issues that come up with paid loss trend, and I guess, BI paid severity is a good example of that. So you look at BI paid severity and it looks fairly dramatic. But as Bob said in his opening comments, about 1\/2 of that increase can be accounted for as a change in the mix of claims settled by report year and a shift in the state mix, and the other 1\/2 is consistent with the medical CPI. So we do have, I guess, some distortion that's always present when you look at the paid versus incurred. But I think if you look -- and I'm assuming you're referring to the bottom chart on Page 7 of the presentation, the underlying margin trend. I think if you look at that consistent pattern over the last several quarters with the nice trend line between earned premium and the losses, I think our goal is to manage that and our goal is to look at the loss trends in aggregate. I think it's somewhat dangerous to focus on the attribution analysis of each component. We have a term Tom and I throw around a lot here. It's \"false precision.\" And we can get trapped in our own map, and we look at it -- we do the attribution analysis and we try to understand each of the drivers, whether they're medical inflation or whether they're a report year or a shift in state mix. But then we look at the aggregate loss trends and the aggregate premium trends, and we look at our rates that we're taking. And our attempt is to manage some of those levers so that each of those -- on one quarter, one is going to go up, the other is going to go down. It's like pushing on a balloon. And our job is to manage the overall size of the balloon and how much air is in there and the pressure being exerted on it. And I think history will show that our team is exceptionally good at managing that. They manage each of the components. They manage loss trends very carefully while maintaining a good customer experience and good customer treatment. And they're very proactive in looking at emerging economic and environmental trends and taking rate where it's appropriate and warranted and mandated and justified. And so I won't get too caught up in the paid volatility. I get a little more focused on the underlying trends, and that's why we tried to show them to you in the slide presentation.","Robert Block","Brian, it's Bob. Just a couple of things to keep in mind. Remember while you're looking at the paid severity trends, you also have to look at the frequency trends. Frequencies are down. And the fact that bodily injury and property damage together make up about 45% of the standard auto losses. So there are other coverages that are in there -- collision comp, uninsured motorist, and everything -- where the trends are good as well. So you're looking at 2 of the big covers, but there are still other pieces to that puzzle, and also the fact that I think you can tell from our reporting on reserves. Our reserves are reasonable and they're accurate.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, you bet. Absolutely. And just one quick one on the life insurance business, if possible. Your investment spreads really kind of improved this quarter. I wonder if there's anything unusual going on there.","Don Civgin","Our investment spreads, Brian, did get a lot better. I think you see several things going on. Some of it is what you'd expect, so we continue to work on crediting rates, and that's being offset somewhat but the lower yields in the portfolio and the continuing lower asset levels. But the investments spread, the biggest impact is the option valuation from the equity index annuities. I think if you look at apples to apples, you're going to have to take that out, and then you get back to what I said, which is the crediting rates offset by yields and the asset levels.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to Hurricane Sandy, it looks like insurance regulators in at least a few impacted states are saying the storm won't technically be classified as a hurricane; therefore, our hurricane deductibles won't apply. So I was curious how the difference between a hurricane versus a tropical storm classification impact Allstate.","Thomas J. Wilson","First, if you're interested in the science of it, a hurricane is -- it gets its energy from the water. The winter storm, or Northeaster, gets its energy from the temperature differential in the air. And  so that's why it's been classified that way. The tropical cyclone deductible, it probably will not be triggered up in the Northeast, and we're prepared for that, and that's what's fair and accurate for our customers. It may or may not -- I'm not sure where we are down in the far Southern states. There maybe a few states that would -- but the damage is much less severe down there than where the hurricane turned in.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So would you say the kind of estimates that a lot of the reputable firms are putting out there take into consideration that those -- the higher deductibles won't be triggered?","Thomas J. Wilson","I don't know for that. I don't know, Mike. Not everybody has a tropical cyclone deductible. I don't know how good their models are on that. It's, of course, very complicated because even when you have it in the marketplace, not every policy has it on it. And so I would say, to the extent it is not triggered, industry losses would obviously be higher than when it is triggered because that's a higher deductible than you would have on a normal all peril policy. But I don't think it would substantially alter the numbers, which are such big wide slots anyway. Now you know that the ranges are billions of dollars, so I don't think it would impact it much.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And as -- in regards to, Tom, the 13% ROE target on a normalized catastrophe load basis obviously. So where will most of the increase come from now given that you guys seem to be getting close to the goal within homeowners not looking to increase auto profitability? I guess I do recall at the Investor Day you talked about unlocking capital within the life insurance segment. Maybe you can update us on that.","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. First, my entire team is raising their hands saying they're going to deliver it. They each want to [indiscernible] First, I think -- I would say we're above that target for the last 12 months, and I think that is reflective of where we would hope it would come from which is maintaining auto margins, improving returns in the homeowner business and getting returns up in the life business. But of course, there were 2 things that happened this quarter, which we wouldn't expect to happen every quarter. One is low path [ph] and the other is the change in the investment spreads that we just talked about. So we still have work to do to fill up the profits ahead of that. So homeowners is -- we feel very good about where it's at. Matt and his team are working hard on it. We've been at this for a while, as you know. We're definitely at a much better position. And we're doing a good job on auto profitability. We do have a little bit of a headwind in the life business with low interest rates, which starts to drift over into the property casualty business. We're going to work to manage our way through that and still achieve our goal, but there's a little bit of a headwind there. To the extent we can reduce the size of the annuity business faster, we will seek to try to do that. It was down about almost $4 billion over the last year. I think it's like $3.8 billion. But it was only down about $700 million in the last quarter. So you can see that rate of decline is down a little bit, and because of low interest rates and people don't want to surrender their policies. So Don and his team are hard at work trying to figure out other ways we can reduce the size of the annuity business, not the life business. The life business is getting good returns for us, the Life Insurance business. So to the extent we can reduce that business, that, of course, frees up capital and we get a higher return out of that as well. So we have a little more work to do on all fronts, but we're feeling better about where we're at.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry. I guess just as a final follow-up then, so within the Allstate Financial, should we be looking at the statutory capital? Because that amount of capital has kind of been staying the same over the last year. The annuity portfolio has been running off, attrition in life has been growing. So we should we expect -- should that number be expected to drift downwards if the current run rates continue?","Thomas J. Wilson","I would -- as the size of -- as Steve pointed out, the size of that portfolio is down about $20 billion or so in the last 3 or 4 years. As that size of that portfolio comes down, I would hope we could have dividends out of that business which would be the statutory capital, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just on homeowners, I was just trying to get a better sense of what the underlying improvement was. On my math, kind of adjusting for the non-cat weather that you've benefited -- you've quantified in previous quarters. It looks like year-to-date, we've got about 470 basis points of improvement, which is a little faster than I think the run rate you all have talked about in the past, and I'm just curious if you could remind us -- I think the difference is there was some adverse weather in 2011. So just remind me if I'm thinking about kind of the puts and takes right.","Matthew E. Winter","Matt, it's Matt. I'm trying to understand your question a little bit. Are you asking about what component is sustainable and what is -- what component is based upon the lower-than-normal cat?","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, you've quantified the lower-than-normal cat, so if I look at just loss ratio, I'm getting year-to-date improvement, 9 months over 9 months of about 470 basis points. And I think, historically, when you've talked about -- so that seems high to me relative to what you've talked about kind of your expectations of core margin improvement. So one, I guess comment on whether or not that perception is correct, about how 470 might compare to your run rate expectation. And then secondly, if it is in fact, a little bit faster, is that attributable to the fact about 2011, I think in 1Q in particular, had some unfavorable weather that might be making that look little bit better. I'm just asking because I want to make sure that as I think about next year, I'm not botching anything up.","Matthew E. Winter","Well, that is true. So we had some unfavorable weather that exacerbates the year-over-year view. But also, I think the other way of looking at this is that this is a fairly volatile business and trying to do it over year-over-year while we're declining, and if in selected areas on the coast, is a little distorted because we're changing the mix of the housing, we're changing the risk profile of the homeowners business as an overall block. And so trying to compare year-over-year as if it's a stagnant steady mix is a little distorted. I think we're changing the risk profile of the business a little. House & Home, as you know, it's gone in. It was 12 states in the third quarter, as I think Tom mentioned, another 5 in October, so 17 states. That  has a different risk profile. And we underwrite roofs differently. We assess the risks differently using some tools that we're used to using on the auto business. And so while -- we are seeing normal year-over-year improvements, where you could back out some of the things, we're also seeing a changing homeowners business, which I think is going to continue to improve. And so I would say that the quality of what is there is higher than it was even a year ago. And I think a lot of what you're seeing that you can't get to mathematically is a result of that change in quality of the business.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as we play that forward in the next year, do you feel like -- is that something that we should expect to continue to help a little bit on the margin as we go into next year, or now we kind of -- is the impact going to be a less dramatic?","Matthew E. Winter","Well, it will be less dramatic. As we put in House & Home, we try to put it in the highest leverage areas first. And so we clearly wanted to maximize the early impact of the shift. And a lot of our efforts on nonrenewal and reduction of homeowners in the coastal areas and high-risk areas is well into the latter part of the timeline. So I would not straight-line it. I think you'll see a continued improvement as a result of those 2 efforts, but not at the same pace as we've currently experienced it.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Sorry that it took so long for me to ask the question in a way that made sense.","Matthew E. Winter","No, no, no. I'm sorry I was struggling with where you were going with it, so I wanted to make sure I was answering what you were truly asking.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, and that was helpful. Then I guess just one on Sandy. And this just goes to -- one of the -- I'm going to bring up Katrina not because I think that should be the baseline when we think about the loss but because there were a lot of adjusting issues because surge is really a big potential loss driver here. Whether it's insured or uninsured or government insured is a different question. But Katrina, right, there were some regulatory push to cover flood losses. But wind -- and there was a lot of gray as to what caught -- and in some cases because there was a lot of gray and there weren't houses left to actually adjust. I'm curious when you think about Sandy based on -- and I know it's early, but do you think -- how is the gray area in this loss wind versus flood on the personal line side contrast with kind of your experience with Katrina? Is that something that gives you a lot of pause, recognizing that normally when you get big events, the tides usually go to policy holders. But I'm just curious more whether or not there will be as much gray.","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me give you a quick answer because I want to make sure we get a couple of other questions in here. Of course, it's too hard to tell, I haven't been on the ground out there so it's hard for me to see. I will tell you that as it relates to Katrina, we did very well on wind versus flood. We were proactive about our approach to that. And of course, the issue there was a house on the coast, big hurricane comes, house is gone. Was it the wave and then the wind came? Or was it the wind and then the wave came? And trying to sort that out. That doesn't appear to be the situation here, but it's way too early to tell what the issues will be. I will tell you that we have a history, though, of doing what's right for our customers and giving them what they paid for.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","How aggressively do you plan on rolling out Drive Wise next year? And is your intent to use that to augment growth, augment profitability or both?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, we don't disclose which states we're going to do it in, Adam. But I will tell you, we like what we see. The customer uptake is a little higher than we thought it would be initially. We think we have a slightly different offering than other people because the device stays in the car as opposed to coming out of the car, which gives us the ability to have a different customer relationship, which says that it should work on both of the elements you've talked about.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up question. It appears that you make more money this year than you have in probably 4 or 5 years. How is that going to reflect when you think about the buyback for next year?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, obviously, I can't comment of what we'll make this year because we're still trying to sort out with Sandy. But I'd like that to be the case, obviously. And let me maybe just go up to capital. We are obviously well capitalized. Today, we have plenty of capital, any which measure you want to put it at. We also generate substantial capital. And we have access to capital in the marketplace. So we have 3 sources of funds from which we could buy back shares or use our capital to grow the business. Obviously, our preferred option is to grow the business particularly in the auto business where we're getting very high returns. Occasionally, we make what I would call, modest acquisitions, whether it be Esurance or Encompass or the Benefits business we bought. And we've gotten good returns on those, but those tended not -- they tend not to be a big portion of our utilization of capital. Of course, as you know, about 80% of the capital we returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. And that has been our history for a long time. When you look at dividends, we, of course, make the decision -- the board makes the decision every quarter. Right now, when you look at our dividend rates, whether that be payout or yield, they look a little low relative to where our stock price is and earnings are. So we'll consider that in the beginning of the year as to what we should do with the dividend. And then on share repurchases, we're not obviously done with the current program. When we are, we'll look at all the sources of capital we have, either the capital on our balance sheet today, our capital generation potential or ability to access capital because as you know, there are some pretty attractive markets today with our equity life securities to use that to restructure and lower our cost of capital. So that's the way we think about it. When we get done with this, which we're pretty close now, we'll be thinking our way through them.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. One question I just have, when you look at insured losses that will come out of Sandy, do you -- how much of that end up getting absorbed or do you think will end up getting absorbed by the National Flood Insurance Program?","Thomas J. Wilson","Really hard to tell, Mike. We don't really -- it's almost impossible to tell right now. I would tell you but you want to go way up. The National Flood Insurance Program ends up being a net drain on the U.S. government. It really is -- if it was your business, you would seek to restructure that business charge of the accurate prices relative to where people's houses were. You'd try to expand the coverages so you weren't only ensuring those houses that get flooded 2 and 3 times. So there is -- I think -- and Congress has struggled with that over time, but their losses are -- the net losses will probably end up being bigger than they would need to be if you brand it as a private business rather than as a political entity. I can't give any estimates for the exact number. I have no idea.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just maybe one on Allstate Financial. I mean, it seems like, I mean, you're clearly moving towards a more underwritten profile as opposed to a spread business. I mean, what is your kind of expectation for that business longer-term? I mean, it doesn't seem like other than the life products, now it doesn't seems like there's a lot of operational synergy or overlap with your kind of captive agent platform. I'm just trying to understand kind of where do you see that business moving as you execute your transitional strategy there?","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay. Well, we look at it a couple of ways, Mike. First, we look at it strategically as it relates to our customers, and then we'd look at it to say where do we get a decent returns. So strategically as it relates to those personal touch point [ph] down in the lower left-hand corner, want advice and a relationship and want branded products. They want to buy all things -- more things from one person rather than multiple people because they don't just feel like having 15 different relationships. Life insurance, some retirement products obviously fit into that category, and we do well there. The life sales, I think are up 6% or 7% this year so far. And we like what we have there in terms of bundling that together. That's good for the customers. That said, it doesn't mean we need to make everything we sell. So we sold the VA business in 2006. Our fixed annuity business today, we use a lot of outsourced products. We have some proprietary products still in that channel, but we use outsourced products. We could -- on the Annuity business, if you don't like the return, now we'll just sell an outsourced product with someone who has a different return objective on it. On the Life Insurance business itself, just life insurance policies, we're getting pretty good returns on our capital well above our cost of capital there. And so we've done that. But we try to separate it into 2 things: what do we need to do for our customers, and then what do we need to do for our shareholders. And we manage our way through that. And that's why we're taking the size of that annuity business down is we don't need to have shareholder capital employed in that to execute our strategy.","Operator","And our final question today is from Randy Binner of FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is another Allstate Financial question. But I appreciate all the commentary on trying to kind of redeploy capital out of particularly the annuity business into what you've perceived to be higher kind of better risk-adjusted returns in really the other protection businesses. And so, I guess just as I think about modeling to the extent that you're successful in kind of getting folks to give up those annuities and then you're able to free up capital from the annuity business, that takes time, and then reallocate it, I'm just trying to think if there is going to be kind of a donut hole or a lag in the earnings that you generate as you kind of transfer that capital around. And so, you know, I guess I'd be kind of interested in your thoughts on that approach, kind of how that affects 2013 earnings. And then I'm not sure if I've heard this in the commentary, but are you thinking about kind of more aggressively trying to go after annuity holders and maybe giving them lump sum payouts or other incentives to surrender?","Thomas J. Wilson","On the last part of your question, the answer would be yes, we are actively looking at that. On the 2013 earnings capital generated from accomplishing that, I would say it's not likely to have a meaningful impact on overall earnings. So if it -- if you just -- you could do the math. For every $100 million of earnings of Allstate Financial, even if you redeploy it into some of that business, we could redeploy it get a higher return than what's it's getting today, even in investing. But it would not be meaningful to force.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So I guess it happens gradually enough over time that there isn't a big block of capital that go -- it needs to get upstream then reallocated and then earned against. It's more of a gradual process because -- I guess in our model, it seems like as you move capital out, there's a little bit of a lag, but it sounds like it's more of a gradual process from your perspective.","Thomas J. Wilson","I would say -- yes, I'm sure there's a lag, but it's not in terms of the overall scope and projections of the company. If you would change auto frequency by 0.5 point, it would have a bigger impact than this would. So you're right. But I would just say as it relates to Allstate Financial, we're approaching it as a \"do it smart, do it when you can.\" And so don't look for sort of a simple, easy solution, where it all goes -- you just change it all. And it's got a kind of do it by line. So Don got the annuity business broken into a whole bunch of different segments, some he cares more about than others. And those that are the biggest in the hole he's working harder on and those that are earning a positive or above cost of capital return. So it's highly segmented, this strategy.","Let me close and just say, first, thank you. We had a good quarter. We're on track for all of our core priorities. If those of you who are still on the queue, Bob is available today, working all day. So feel free to reach out or he'll reach out to you. And as it relates to Sandy, we're working hard to do what our customers pay us for. We'll provide additional perspective on loss estimates when we can give you a more informed perspective. So thank you very much, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Block","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. After our prepared remarks presented by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter 2013 and posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted a document describing our current reinsurance program. All of these are available on our website.","This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations, Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012, our 10-Q for the second quarter and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. We're recording this call and a replay will be available following the conclusion of the call. I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","Now I'll turn the program over to Tom Wilson. Tom?","Thomas J. Wilson","Good morning, and thanks for investing your time with us. I'll start by covering the second quarter results as they relate to our strategy and our 2013 priority. Bob and Steve will cover the business performance and capital actions that we're taking in the quarter. The performance this quarter is driven by a strong management team, who is familiar, of course, to many of you. And they're here as well to provide additional perspective in the question-and-answer period. So Matt Winter who leads our Allstate Agency business; Don Civgin, who has responsibility for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin is our Chief Investment Officer; Don Bailey leads the Emerging Businesses; and Sam Pilch is our Corporate Controller.","We generated solid results in the second quarter reflecting the successful execution of our strategy, which is to offer unique products and services to distinct customer segments. This strategy distinguishes us from the other personal lines companies who focus on either one customer segment or just using different methods of distribution. We believe that a focus on the entire value proposition will lead to longer-term growth and profitability. You can see positive outcomes from the strategy this quarter, particularly as the impacts from restructuring The Allstate brand homeowners business becomes less severe.","On Slide 2, we showed the 4 customer segments and our property-liability results for each one. There's 3 brands where we underwrite the risks. Allstate, Encompass and Esurance all grew in net written premium and premium and Answer Financial also increased nonproprietary premium. With the Allstate brand which serves customers who prefer local advice and assistance and a branded experience, units declined from the prior year quarter but increased from the first quarter of 2013. Auto policies were flat versus year ago, while homeowners declined by 4.4%, reflecting the actions taken to improve returns. As these profit improvement actions are successful, we believe the negative impact on growth will be reduced. The Allstate agencies did a great job this quarter at very strong results with higher customer satisfaction, improved retention for standard auto and homeowners, strong new business growth reflecting both the company marketing and local agency initiative.","The action has taken over the last 3 years to position high-performing agencies for success by concentrating and supporting them, and restructuring compensation is working. This segment maintained the profitability of the combined ratio of 94.6% and underlying combined ratio of 85.4% as rate increases essentially offset modest costs and increases.","The Encompass brand in the upper left serves customers who want local advice for the choice of products and services continue to show positive growth with units up 6.8%. Strategically, we remained focus on household penetration with our unique package policy that represents about 75% of Encompass' volume. The combined ratio in the quarter was 102.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 92.7%. Pricing and underwriting actions continue to be taken to improve margins.","The Esurance brand serves as self-directed, brand-sensitive customer segment and continue to generate significant premium and unit growth as it successfully leverages the benefits of being part of Allstate. Increased advertising is more effective. Sophisticated pricing for preferred risk auto customers and improved claim practices are designed to acquire and retain profitable lifetime value customers. The combined ratio remained high at 119.7%, reflecting the high levels of marketing spend and the expensing of acquisition intangibles. The loss ratio did increase over prior year quarter, however, reflecting increase by the injury severities and higher-than-expected discount utilization.","Gary Tolman and Esurance team are working closely with Don to adjust pricing and underwriting to ensure we maintain the long-term profitability of this growth. Overall, our customer-focused strategy is strengthening our competitive position.","On Slide 3, we provide a progress report on the 5 operating priorities for 2013. I've already covered to grow insurance premiums priority for property-liability. Allstate Financial increased premiums in contract charges, 3.6% over the second quarter of 2012. Net growth in premiums and contract charges for underwritten products is 4.8%, with Allstate benefits growing 11.9% compared to the prior year quarter. We maintained auto profitability in the quarter with a standard auto combined ratio of 97% for the 3 underwriting brands comparable to the second quarter of last year. The Allstate brand, which represents about 90% of the earned premium, had the combined ratio 94.9% as 0.6 points better last year's second quarter. And an underlying combined ratio 94.2%, which is slightly higher than the prior year quarter.","We continue to make progress on raising returns in homeowners with a combined ratio of 95.3%, a 9.1-point improvement from Q2 2012. Allstate brand homeowners had a combined ratio of 95.2% and an underlying combined ratio of 62.7%, 1.9 points better than the prior year quarter.","Annuity returns did increase in the second quarter, but the long-term outlet is still -- outlook is still challenged by low interest rates.","Our fourth goal is to proactively manage investments. In the second quarter, we continued to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates in the property-liability portfolio by selling long bonds and investing in shorter maturities. If you look over the last 1.5 years, the percentage of bonds and maturities longer than 7 years decreased from 46% to 20% of the property-liability portfolio. If we had not taken this approach, investment income, of course, would've been higher, but the value of the portfolio would have declined by more than it did this quarter.","If you just measured over the last 9 months, the portfolio would have declined by an additional $400 million as interest rates rose in the second quarter. The total return for the quarter was a negative 1.5% and the unrealized gain position declined the value by $2.7 billion in the quarter.","The fifth priority is to reduce our cost structure, so we can give customers great value with a differentiated offering. We announced the closing of our call center and introduced employee benefit changes that are effective at the beginning of 2014 that would equalize benefits amongst employees and reduce costs. We're also eliminating some retiree life insurance benefits starting in 2014 up to 2016. In the quarter, our property-liability expense ratio did increase, primarily due to technology and marketing investments to support profitable growth. Over time, we expect this ratio to the decline.","As you know, we also took another step to improve shareholder returns from Allstate Financial by entering into an agreement to sell Lincoln Benefit Life to the Resolution Group. Lincoln Benefit primarily serves customers that want their local advice and a choice of life and annuity products, which is the upper left-hand quadrant on the foursquare. It also manufacture life and annuity products that were sold throughout the agencies. Strategically, we did not have a differentiated offering, corporate capability or size that generated track returns as annuity customers independent agencies. As a result, we chose to exit this business as we did variable annuities, the bank broker distribution channels and payout annuities. This will enable us to redeploy capital into higher return activities. We will retain the life insurance risks written through the Allstate agencies via the Esurance agreement. We also announced Allstate Financial's decision to stop writing fixed annuities, but we will provide Allstate agencies and exclusive financial specialists with similar nonproprietary products so they can fully meet customers needs.","Now let me turn it back over to Bob.","Robert Block","Thanks, Tom. On Slide 4, we provide financial highlights for our consolidated results, as well as Property-Liability and Allstate Financial. Referring to top half of the slide, on a consolidated basis, we generated net income of $434 million or $0.92 per common share in the second quarter. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by higher after tax realized capital gains, and operating income more than offsetting the $312 million after tax loss on the repurchase of $1.83 billion debt as part of our capital management program.","Operating income of $529 million or $1.12 per common share increased 22.5% from Q2 2012, driven primarily from lower catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2013 compared to the prior year quarter. Net income return on equity was 11.6% and 12.3% on an operating income basis, both increases from the second quarter 2012.","Details underlying these overall results are shown on the bottom half of the slide. Property-liability recorded $617 million in net income for the second quarter, a significant increase compared to the prior year quarter. Earned premium of $6.9 billion grew 2.9% from Q2 2012 with a combined ratio of 96.1 and improvement of 1.9 points.","Catastrophe losses in the second quarter were $647 million, down $172 million from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.9%, below the full year outlook range and 0.6 points higher than the second quarter of 2012.","Now before the question about updating the outlook range for the underlying combined ratio of 88% to 90% set earlier this year can be raised in the Q&A, I want to say that we are not updating the range at this time. Should the first half trends continue for the second half of 2013, we could finish the year a little better than or at the lower end of this range. The combined ratios on recorded and underlying basis for each brand are shown on the lower right-hand side of the deck of the exhibit.","The Allstate brand continued to generate solid profitability as positive effects of rate changes essentially offset the modest increases in loss cost on an underlying basis.","Encompass recorded combined ratio results for the quarter were comparable to prior year quarter, while the underlying combined ratio improved by 4.3 points.","Esurance combined ratio of the 119.7% remained elevated, reflecting the impacts of increased new business volume, higher bodily injury severities and increased utilization of price discounts. Allstate Financial posted net income of $190 million in the quarter, an improvement of $58 million from Q2 2012.","Operating income benefited from favorable results in the benefit and investment spreads, partially offset by a small increase in operating costs. Realized capital gains were higher than in second quarter 2012 by $32 million after tax. Premiums and contract charges increased 3.6% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012, helped by an 11.9% increase for Allstate Benefits.","On Slide 5, we provide net written premium and policy in force trends by brand and in total. The property-liability, net written premium increased 4.2% from the second quarter 2012, and overall units were essentially flat with the prior year quarter and grew 177,000 from the first quarter 2013.","Our strategy to provide unique products and services to distinct customer segments is working as net written premium grew compared to the second quarter 2012 for each brand, and units also increased from the first quarter 2013.","Within the Allstate brand, which serves customers that prefer local advice and assistance in a branded experience, standard auto net written premium of $4 billion increased 2.8% from the prior year quarter, while units increased sequentially but were flat year-over-year. Allstate brand homeowners net written premium of $1.7 billion grew 3.3% and unit volume declined at a slower rate than the prior quarter. The result for both of these lines reflect favorable trends in new business and retention. On the bottom 2 charts, you can see the growth trends for Encompass which serves customers who want local advice but the choice of products and services and Esurance serving self-directed brand sensitive customers. We'll continue to grow compared to the prior year in net written premium and unit. And we've been able to maintain margins as that within premium strands improve.","On Slide 6, we have combined the margin trends for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners on 1 slide. The charts on the left-hand side of the slide showed the earned premium and loss trends per policy. While the chart on the right-hand side show the combined ratio trends.","For standard auto, losses per policy increased at a rate just slightly higher than the earned premium per policy. Essentially, flat frequencies and modern increases in severities were partially offset by increases in rates. The combined ratio for standard auto remained at a consistently profitable level. For Allstate brand homeowners shown on the bottom half of the slide, loss cost increases per policy remained at very low levels running below the increase in earned premium per policy. This resulted in an improvement in the underlying combined ratio of 1.9 points to 62.7%. The recorded combined ratio for quarter was 95.2%, a 9.7. point gain from prior year. Now let's go to Steve.","Steven E. Shebik","Thank you, Bob. Second quarter investment results reflect continued interest rate risk reduction actions in our property-liability portfolio, maintaining alignment with Allstate financial's changing liability profile and continued repositioning of our public equity portfolio to a more targeted strategy. The carrying value of our portfolio declined $5 billion to $92.3 billion compared to $97.3 billion at year-end, reflecting the reduction of Allstate Financial's spread-based liabilities, as well as lower fixed income valuations due to higher interest rates. We continue to increase the equity and owned component of our portfolio from which we expect to generate higher returns over time. However, earnings on these assets will be more variable.","On Slide 7, you can see net investment income totaled $984 million in the second quarter, slightly ahead of the prior quarter but lower in the second quarter of 2012. The decline in core debt income was mitigated somewhat by prepayment fees, as well as litigation proceeds, which added an aggregate $37 million in net investment income for the quarter. Total portfolio yield was 4.6%, slightly ahead of the prior quarter and consistent with the second quarter of 2012.","Turning to total return, in the bottom right graph, lower fixed income valuations resulting from significant increase in treasury rates led to a negative total return of 1.5% for the second quarter despite a consistent contribution from net investment income. An attribution of the change in unrealized capital gains is provided on the bottom left of the slide. The increase in rates, along with somewhat wider credit spreads, grew to a $2.4 billion decrease of unrealized capital gains compared to year-end 2012, $2.2 billion of which occurred in the second quarter. While the decrease in unrealized gains during the quarter was significant, we estimate the valuation decline of property-liability portfolio was mitigated by approximately $400 million to the repositioning of the portfolio that began at the third quarter of last year. Additionally, Allstate Financial assets and liabilities are more effectively managed on an economic basis.","We move to Slide 8, the fixed trends on our property-liability and Allstate Financial business units. As you can see in the graph in the top left, the earned yield trend on our property-liability core debt reflects 4 quarters of risk reduction activity. To our risk reduction actions, we positioned the portfolio to be less adversely impacted by increasing interest rates and bodes for our future income to realization of gains and the sale of longer-term securities as shown in the scheduled maturity graph in the upper right.","The current yield on our intermediate corporates, our targeted reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1 3\/4% to 2%. Given the shortfall relative to the portfolio yield, maturity and sales activities have and will continue to result in a decline in net investment income for the core debt portfolio.","For Allstate Financial, you can see at the bottom of the page, the net investment income has declined as a result of the managed reduction of spread-based liabilities, a trend that will be accelerated with the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Over the past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows rather than being reinvested. So the portfolio yield has not declined as much as the property-liability portfolio. Future investment income will continue to be impacted by the pace of liability outflows in the reinvestment activity.","Slide 9 provides a recap of the recent transactions we have announced. In May, we initiated a capital management plan designed to increase our capital flexibility to get advantage of the low-interest rate environment. We purchased $1.83 billion of debt, recognizing an after-tax loss of $312 million in the second quarter. We issued $500 million each of 10-year and 30-year notes and $287.5 million of preferred -- perpetual preferred stock. We expect to issue an additional of approximately $2 billion perpetual preferred stock and subordinate hybrid debt to complete the debt refinancing, pre-fund our $950 million of 2014 maturity and complete the current share repurchase program.","After the quarter closed, we announced changes to our pension and life insurance benefits, as well as the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. The impacts should be reflected on our financial statements beginning in the third quarter. The table at the bottom of the slide summarizes the estimated impacts of each on a pro forma basis as if they have occurred on June 30, based on the midpoint for the ranges we have announced.","Our pension and postretirement reliabilities will be remeasured effective July 15, and the impact of the changes in benefits and higher discount rate given the rising interest rates during the year will be recognized for the most part in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of equity. A separate curtailment gain related to the changes in retiree life will be recognized in income. The impact of ongoing retirement and benefit expenses is currently being calculated based upon assumptions as of July 15.","As Sam mentioned, the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life exit the business, which we did not have a competitive customer or market position. The transaction reduces our financial risk as expected to free up approximately $1 billion of employable capital. This capital will be freed up in The Allstate Lincoln Insurance company. And as you know, a number of steps will be necessary for us to move that ultimately to the parent company.","Lincoln Benefit Life will be treated as held for sale beginning in third quarter with its assets and liabilities collapsed in a separate line in the balance sheet. The estimated loss in sale will be recorded and adjusted in future quarters until the sales close. We remain in a strong capital position at the end of the second quarter.","Slide 10 shows our capital position at various points in time. We have split up a long-term debt between senior debt and hybrid debt, so you can see the change in the makeup over time. When our capital plan is fully completed, we expect the slit between senior and hybrid debt to be approximately 60% to 40%. Our estimated statutory surplus at June 30 to $17 billion in total, with $13.6 billion estimated for the property-liability companies. Holding company level assets were $2.4 billion.","As Bob noted, our net and operating returns on equity was consistent in the last few quarters in the 11% to 12% range. Overall, a solid quarter will make good practice on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and our 2013 priorities.","With that, why don't we open it up to questions?","Thomas J. Wilson","Okay, Matt. Could you start with Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just one question on standard auto. I mean, it looks like -- so sequentially, PIF grew mid -- year-over-year decline was the lowest it has been in a while. If we were to just roll forward that sequential growth, I mean, you can be looking at PIF growth for the first time in a long time later this year. I mean, is that something that you're thinking about? Is that something that you're moving towards just given where the profitability is there now? Or you just love your thoughts on that?","Thomas J. Wilson","Mike, I assume you're talking about The Allstate brands, which...","Yes. I'd throw it to Matt Winter.","Matthew E. Winter","Michael, certainly, we're looking at that and focused on that. And our goal is to do what we've been working on for many years, which is to position ourselves so that we can get in a position that both new business and retention are improving. And we retained a strong muscle of auto profitability at the same time. And so a lot of effort has gone into that. A lot of that was influenced by actions that we had to take in the homeowners market. As you know, now that a decline in the homeowners PIF has slowed and the new business has picked up there, that has also assisted in the standard auto line. 80% of our homeowners new business comes with at least one auto. And so that, in combination with all of the work that the team has done and the agency owners have done to drive new business and improve retention, has put us in a position where we're looking forward to continuing to make momentum on the new business and the retention. And we believe that over time, that will yield favorable results for us.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So looking at that to 2Q to 1Q sequential, I mean, is that something -- is that fair to kind of think about extrapolating in terms of your -- internally, your own goal to say, \"Look, we're here. We think we can start turning this into actually positive growth this year?\"","Matthew E. Winter","No, it's always dangerous to extrapolate from one quarter. We think we see a lot of positive trends. We think we're doing a lot of things that have long-term, sustainable impact. And we believe, as long as we're diligent, they'll have long-term favorable results.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one quick one on the Life business. Is there anything in there for the second quarter that is -- that's nonrecurring? I mean, when we want to -- let's think about what the economics are there, excluding the transaction that you guys just completed. Is there anything else we need to peel out from those results to have sort of a clean number?","Thomas J. Wilson","Yes, I'll let Don answer that, but you should not expect the operating interest to stay at its level as that -- obviously, there's some one-time items Don can talk about. But secondly, I remember that business keeps keeping smaller. So as it gets smaller in size, obviously, it's going to generate less operating income.","Don Civgin","Yes, I think -- Mike, it's Don. I'd say, there's nothing, strictly speaking, that's nonrecurring. Nothing from the sale of LBL is reflected in there. But there's a lot volatility in the investment income line. And we had a really good quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So a couple of years ago, you guys identified 13% ROE by 2014 as a sort of the primary operating goal the firm was going to be positioned around. You've made a lot of progress of that. You're coming close to -- I think you're regularly sort of hitting at 12% on an operating basis. Should we still think about that as a 2014 -- as sort of -- as the firm's 2014 objective as you're now starting to work through your annual planning process?","Thomas J. Wilson","Josh, this is Tom. Good memory. So of course, 2 years ago, we established the goal of 13% by '14 when we're operating at about a 9% return, which was a 400 basis point improvement. And at that point, it was really to show that we had conviction that we could make substantial improvement in returns. It was not an indicator that 13% was the exact right sweet spot on creating shareholder value. Now there were some assumptions underneath that 400-basis point improvement. One was we had to make sure we maintained auto profitability, which you see we've continued to. Second, about 70% of that increase was related to improving returns in homeowners. And we're well on our way there, in fact, we're getting somewhere, we'll get into that this morning, and Matt can give an update on that. But there were 2 other goals: one was maintain investment income and rates have moved down by about 250 basis points since that time. So we're not on track to do -- to maintain that portion of the increase. And then lastly, it was to raise returns of Allstate Financial from about 9% to 10%. And as you can see -- and because of the interest rates and some other things that are going on there, we're not at that point either. So we're working hard on those last 2 items as you know. At the same time, we're also investing more in Esurance than we thought we were because we like their growth there. And we've changed the capital structure, so there's a bunch of moving pieces in there. As we get closer to 2014, we'll be updating our range and you'll be able to figure out with where the capital structure is and where we are, what it will look like for next year. But we're not giving any indication. I'll tell you, though, our goal, of course, is just to get as attractive a return as we can while driving growth in the business, in the environment win. But I don't want it us to blindly chase a number that's an accounting number as opposed to an economic number, which ultimately drives shareholder value. So working hard on driving it up. But -- so for example, when we shortened the duration in the portfolio, which saves us a bunch of money this quarter. Of course, if you just mark-to-market this quarter, that would have took away some of that ROE. But we thought it was a good trade from a risk-return standpoint. So we're going to always manage to what we think is good long-term value, and then we'll update it as we go forward this 2014.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's really helpful, Tom. I guess I'll just ask the obvious -- the follow-up question that you sort of teed up on, which is on homeowners margin expansion. Is that -- would you guys still think of that as the primary earnings lever, I mean, recognizing that you're doing a bunch of stuff, expenses, expenses on the both on the debt side, as well as internally. But is that still sort of the primary lever we should be focused on? And the question would be: How much more good news do you think you can get out of the various initiatives House & Home and things like that you're pursuing today?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, I'll let Matt talk about what he's doing. I'll just remind you, we think we've captured a lot of where we were. We were in the 70s underlying combined ratio at that time. I don't remember the exact number, Josh, but now we're in the low 60s, which is where we said we thought we need to go. Matt is doing a whole bunch of things, though, and with his team to take it from what would became a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for competitive advantage. And I'll let him talk about both that and sustainability and profitability.","Matthew E. Winter","Sure. Thanks for the question. You're correct that we've looked to homeowners for several years to improve the overall profitability of the enterprise. Well, the good news is the underlying profitability continues to improve as we benefit from some of the actions taken in the last several quarters. It has allowed us to begin growth, if you look at new business growth in homeowners and retention. Both are improved as we've had to take less rate because we're closer to rate adequate. And all the House & Home that goes in, goes in as rate adequate. So we're -- we continue to make improvement in what we have and at this point, as we put on profitable high-margin, high-return business, our goal is to figure out how to do more and more of that while remaining in the proper risk profiles. So a lot of the work we're doing now has to do with how we manage that risk, how we manage concentration risk and how we can manage those 2 elements and still grow and continue to expand the homeowners business and all the auto that -- and other products that come with it.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the Allstate brands, premium growth is now at the highest levels since 2005. And my sense is there's a number of numerical drivers to that, but one of the most interesting would be the recovery in homeowners. I mean, for example, I'm hearing in New York and the drive time in the morning, more advertising. So maybe you can talk a little bit about the level of comfort of increasing the homeowners' exposure? And then also, other personal lines is showing, by far, the fastest growth among The Allstate brands. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what's driving that, and whether you're getting cross-selling opportunities as a result?","Thomas J. Wilson","Jay, I'll let -- maybe, Matt, can talk about perhaps what he's -- he already talked a little bit about what he's doing at House & Home. But maybe he can talk a little bit about PML optimization or probable maximum loss optimization. And then Don Bailey can give you some insights into what we're doing on the other lines, which is, of course, focused around -- the strategy that Matt is trying to execute or is executing with our agencies is about selling lots of stuff to these customers. So you're right to think about it as a total package as opposed to a line. Way too often, people started looking at us and talking about a single product when, really, we're talking about the variety, the breadth and longevity of our relationship.","Matthew E. Winter","So Jay, I'm glad that our advertising spend is hitting you, and that you're hearing it. As I mentioned, I believe at the last call as well, one of the areas that we're spending a lot of time on in homeowners is PML optimization. And the other is what we call aggregate risk management, which is really just looking at our homeowners portfolio in figuring out, at a more granular and sophisticated level, how we could use diversification benefit, how we could use various combinations of product sets and features and reinsurance to manage to grow in some areas without increasing above an acceptable level our probable maximum loss or our concentration risk. And so what you're seeing now in New York is a very careful and, I think, very disciplined way of thoughtfully growing a little bit within the state in those areas that do not pose undue concentration risk or PML risk for us. So we're doing it fairly thoughtfully. We're doing it in a way that maximizes the overall number of products that it brings to us. And so as Tom mentioned, we're trying to look at this from a household perspective, not a single line perspective. So what you'll see is we may be growing more in those areas where we get multiple products with the Home as opposed to a single non-line [ph] Home. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don Bailey, who can talk to you a little bit about the other personal lines.","Donald J. Bailey","Thanks, Matt. So as Tom mentioned, the other personal lines incorporates a portfolio of additional products. And we have, if you listen to the language in the hallways here, really changed the language -- Matt certainly led that with us trying to pivot from more of a product-focused organization to a household-focused organization, for all the right reasons. Our close rates go up, retention rates go up, profitability improves as a result. And the consumer household lines, as we refer to them, really are critical in terms of making progress in that effort. So the language has certainly changed, but a lot of other things have changed for us, too, over the last several months. Our training in this regard has changed. Technology has substantially improved to help enable more of these cross-sells and household penetration. The product design aspects of these portfolio have evolved to be more agent-friendly, to be more consumer-friendly. And so we made progress there. And then our expectations of all of us and everybody in the field and of our agents have changed in terms of what we are seeking in terms of an outcome on this phase. So the last thing that we've done is we put leadership focused specifically on that. Let's make progress on that. Let's hit targets on that. Let's make sure this is a meaningful piece of our success story as we go forward. So yes, you'll see that in there. It's not by accident.","Thomas J. Wilson","I would just point out on Page 25 of the supplement, we've started to break out the -- how we look at our customers and trying to help you see that we can't separate where our customer relationship from where we deployed capital. So you'll see advantage where we sell other people's products to the agencies. You'll see the nonproprietary premiums at the bottom of that, which is -- almost $1.4 billion. So that gets to the point that Matt and Don were just making. And what we're doing with the annuities as well, which is we want to sell those to our customers, we know our customers need and want them. It helps our relationship, but it's not a place where we choose to deploy capital. So we've been able to separate those by getting more sophisticated.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the issue of Encompass, one of the challenges there appears to be the standard auto and continuing to run well above the 100% combined ratio level. What's the issue there and kind of effect?","Donald J. Bailey","So on the -- this is Don Bailey. On the Encompass piece, if you'd look at the loss ratio -- if you look at the underlying loss ratio, you'll see that we've actually improved rather substantially on that on a year-over-year basis. And why is that? We've had a move from probably a further with a mono-line or segment auto approach to a package approach. The auto line performs far better in a package than it does on a standalone basis. So we've made meaningful changes in moving our portfolio forward in that regard and we're seeing progress in that unacceptable number as a result. We're also taking meaningful rates in that space as well. So while the number isn't where we want it to be today, there clearly is underlying improvement there and it will continue to be as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 questions on Allstate Protection. One, we did see a slight uptick in the underlying loss ratio for Allstate brand standard auto. Is it fair to attribute that to the improving Allstate count growth? And is there -- can you talk about how much more of that increase, if you're will be willing to tolerate, for the sake of policy growth?","Thomas J. Wilson","Matt did that. Yes, I would point out just a slight uptick remember there's -- as you know, there's a lot of variability in sort of frequency. It varies on quarter-by-quarter basis.","Matthew E. Winter","Hey, Meyer, it's Matt. You should not think of it as a trade-off between profitability and growth because that's not what we're doing. We are focused on growing and maintaining profitability. So it's not a question of -- that we're letting our combined ratio creep up in order to facilitate growth. I think most of the uptick that you see is attributable to 2 pieces of the loss ratio. The PD paid severity and the BI paid severity. So let me take you through those. The PD paid severity was elevated in the quarter. But if you recall in the first quarter, PD severity was below prior year by almost a point. And we attributed that to the subro demands that were at significantly lower than normal levels. Those subros typically carry a higher severity than average claims. And in the second quarter, what we've seen is a higher-than-normal subro demands, about 25% higher actually. And our working hypothesis is that due to Superstorm Sandy, the other carriers' workloads were such for the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year that they delayed the subro processing and the payments until the second quarter. So we are seeing that uptick. Now it's merely a delay from the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter this year, but on a normalized annual basis, it's right in line with our historical average. On the BI paid severity, I mentioned last quarter, that we were accelerating the closure of older, more complex claims. And that in combination with the change in state mix and liability limits contributed to the increase. If you take that -- those 2 pieces out, the remainder was in line with medical care CPI. And so that has actually come down off of that peak as we've said as we work through more of those older, more complex claims. And we're moving much closer to historical norms, which around the medical care CPI. The only place that you can see any \"investment\" in our growth show up in the combined ratio is we pointed out that we did make some targeted investments in technology and marketing this quarter, which have shown up in the expense ratio. Those were intentional. We believe this was the right time to make some targeted investments in technology and marketing in order to push momentum and provide our agents with the tools and the stability they need to handle this higher volume. And it's certainly controllable and will continue to monitor when it makes sense to continue to invest in those 2 areas and when it may make sense to slowdown that investment.","Thomas J. Wilson","Meyer, let me also make one overall strategic comments, of course, price is obviously very important as you point out as a driver of customer's decision-making. But that's not the only component of our strategy. Our strategy, of course, is to give a highly focused customer value proposition that means good price to value. So price is not the only lever as what Matt is saying that you can drive growth. Whether it's better technology so the agencies can do a better job knowing who their customers are, whether it's new products and launching those. We have a multifaceted way that we're seeking to grow not just -- we don't view it as just a price and profit trade off for growth.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That was very thorough. I appreciate it. On the homeowners side, when we look at the aggregated lower reinsurance spend that you disclosed last night, I guess, does that still translate in -- let me ask this differently. Do you expect to retain the savings for the past month to customers? Or -- and is the overall internal cat provision lower or higher than it was 12 months ago?","Thomas J. Wilson","The internal tax provision? I...","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","No. Catastrophe provision.","Thomas J. Wilson","Oh, catastrophe provision. Well, let me take a shot at it and see if anyone else wants to join in here because it's a complicated question. If you go way up, we looked at hurricane or earthquake losses and said we don't want to have those losses. So -- but we don't want to get rid of the homeowners line so we're going to sort of synthetically divest some significant portion of those by using reinsurance. And that's how we get started in doing reinsurance. When we first did that, we were not able to pass that to in our higher rates because it takes a while to get it through the regulators. Since that time, we made a bunch of changes to our filings and most of it, but not all of it, gets passed through. So as costs come down, we would expect over time that to be factored into our pricing. That may or may not translate into different homeowners prices because there's all kinds of other pieces of loss cost going through there. And we may or may not be getting it back for -- that portion of the company where the reduction comes from. We don't really have an internal way in which you're describing it so we -- Matt works with Steve and Sam and they figure out what the right balance is working with our Enterprise Risk and Return Council with inside the guidelines. So there's not really -- there's nothing we're doing internally that would confuse the reported results.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to Allstate brand auto rate actions, so if I look at the 10-Q it shows 0.4% rate increases on a year-to-date basis in 21 states. So I was curious is that the level of rate increases we should be thinking about through year end? And if so, does that imply that the you're okay allowing the loss ratio to rise a little bit?","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, let me start at the end. No, we're not okay allowing the loss ratio to rise a little bit. What you're seeing is a 1-month -- 1-quarter snapshot in what should be viewed on a much longer basis. So if you go back historically, and that's long before I took over this role, the company has been very good about consistently reflecting its experience and what it was seeing in these rates and taking rates as needed. Not holding back on rate actions hoping that stuff goes away. Not holding back on rate actions in order to capture market share, but passing those through as they were experienced and as we were seeing them. And as a result, sometimes we have what I refer to as a first mover disadvantaged because we took rates sooner than some of our competitors and on a more consistent basis. And sometimes, it's actually to our benefit because we got out ahead of the curve. I think what you're seeing now is we're out ahead of the curve in many areas. And also, suggest you go back several years, 2 or 3 years. The vast majority of the rate that you were seeing was driven by a couple of very large states, notably Florida and New York. If you go back to 2010, somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of the overall country rate that you saw was driven by those 2 states. Now that those 2 states have returned to profitability and are requiring less rate action, it's the smaller states where we've taken consistent rate as needed that are just vacillating. And we will continue to monitor it closely. We will take rates as needed. We are not deliberately trying to let loss ratios float up as you refer to. We're going to continue to do what we've always done. It's just that our timing is better because we did the hard work upfront and it cost us upfront. If you go back several years you saw that on the homeowners side and the auto side, and now we're actually benefiting from that timing.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. Lastly, in regards to the initiative to issue additional hybrid debt in the coming year, do you expect to take advantage of the debt-to-capital equity credit? I think, I believe that's provided by the rating agencies for those types of securities and to potentially repurchase stock in excess of earnings, taking advantage of that credit.","Thomas J. Wilson","So our goal -- our first program we announced last December, our share repurchase, was effectively a hybrid debt for equity swap. We said we would issue $1 billion of hybrids, we would buy back $1 billion of stock. So we have actually been working on that specific transaction for 2013. The rest of the program, about $2 billion more we expect to issue hopefully during the course of the rest of this year, maybe $750 million or so of hybrids and $1 billion, $1.25 billion of preferred. That is part of our capital management strategy we have previously talked about and does not impact any future share repurchase program, which we generally look at once a year towards the beginning of the year as part of our strategic planning process.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Related to what you talked about with Mike on pricing, I just see 2 very different pricing strategies at Esurance versus Allstate brand. What are you reacting to at Esurance, which has rather meaningful price increases versus what's your reaction with Allstate brand where you think you can be moderate?","Don Civgin","Josh, it's Don. It's Don Civgin. Let me talk a little bit about Esurance first. First of all, Esurance obviously was -- is designed for an different customer value proposition. Different product, different features and it competes in a different market. The transaction -- 1.5 years into it -- you guys have been through this before, where you're 1.5 years into a transaction and lots of things are going wrong. In this particular case, I'm proud of the fact that Esurance has really only one thing that we're focused on right now. And a lot of things have gone well. The integration has gone well, advertising, brand linkage, all of that's worked well. The combined ratio is high, part of it is high because of the advertising expense that we've talked about before, but the loss ratio on the second quarter was higher than Gary or I were anticipating or would like. We are taking price increases. We've taken them -- if you look over the course of last few quarters, we've taken them pretty consistently as well. Those decisions are independent from what Matt is doing on The Allstate brand. What we're trying to do at Esurance is make sure that the combination of the loss results, as well as the rest of the expenses result in an economic combined ratio over the life of the product. So I'm less concerned about the advertising expense being elevated than I am over the life of that customer. Are we having a good economic combined ratio that gives me good return on capital and create shareholder value? So that's why we've taken the price increases in the last quarter. And I'll be honest, I think we're going to continue to take some price increases going forward in spite of the fact that might pressure some of the growth we've seen. It's the right thing to do to get the loss ratio to where we want it to be.","Matthew E. Winter","So Josh, it's Matt. Let me just follow-on on The Allstate brand part. First of all, as Don explained, it's a different segment and it's a different block of business. There historical business has been somewhat different than The Allstate brand and they started in a different place. So it's somewhat deceptive to look at price increases without knowing where the starting point was. We experienced that in homeowners over the last several years. It depends where your start. It depends upon how much of a price increase -- rate increase you have to take. And so as we have different blocks and different starting points, it's not surprising that in some places, Esurance may have to take more significant rate than Allstate brand. And it might happen that we're doing just the opposite in some states at some point in the future. I would think of them as somewhat independent.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's perfectly appropriate. Looking at the homeowners that you still bled about 41,000 homeowners between 1Q '13 and 2Q '13. Where are you in terms of shaping the portfolio to where you want it to be from a catastrophe perspective? And two, were you in the process of trying to win back customers who you lost in the reshaping process and you actually -- if you could have tailor-made it perfectly for you, you would have never non-renewed?","Matthew E. Winter","This is Matt again. We're making good progress in our efforts. Once again, I can't tell you either what inning we're in or what yard line we are, but I can tell you, I feel good about the progress that's been made. And I think the fact that if the client has slowed dramatically and consistently over the last several quarters is an indication that we are -- we have less work to do and we're taking less severe action there. That being said, it's all going to depend upon the combination of new business and retention. So new business was up 35% in the second quarter. That's great. It accelerated the improvements seen in the previous quarters, but retention is going to be one of our core levers there. And retention did tick up last quarter, but I still think we work to do. And it's not just on the winning back of those customers who we may non-renewed previously, but it's also keeping those customers we have. And so we have a fairly concerted effort on the retention front. New business -- the new business engine is moving specially with House & Home, which the growth in -- new business growth for House & Home is about 6 points higher than it is for the countrywide average. So the House & Home initiative certainly is helping us on the new business side. But the lever that I think we have to pull even harder is the retention one. And certainly as we have less profitability actions to take as we have less rate to put in and less nonrenewals and less strict underwriting guidelines. As we return to a more normalized level, my expectation is we'll continue to see improvement on retention as well.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And to what extent do look at the marketplace and see your competitors also re-underwriting their books? I mean, I'm not right now in the market for homeowners insurance. But I imagine everyone tells me it's pretty hard to find a reasonable rate. I'm surprised retention isn't better given the lack of options?","Thomas J. Wilson","Let me move aside because I want to make sure we get people time for questions. So I think, Matt here is getting a long-term plan to start to grow the business and you'll start to see that play out as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","It looks like you're giving us an early warning that you may improve your guidance in underwriting although you didn't go all the way through. That's with a little negative wiggle in Esurance so what are you seeing and what are the biggest drivers that's coming in better than you thought beginning of the year given that Esurance sounds like it might be a slight negative in your -- versus earlier expectations?","Thomas J. Wilson","Bob, this is Tom. Look, confused about it. It's a early warning on an improvement in one's forecast [indiscernible] but we -- what we did is of course 5 or 6 years years ago. We moved away from the guidance and we said we'll just tell you what we think the underlying combined ratio will be for the year. We put in at a range -- frequency bounces around from year-to-year. It's weather-driven, a whole bunch of things. You can easily get a point move in a combined ratio just from frequency. Severity obviously can bounce around as well. So we try to put a range on it. We're feeling good about where we are in that range, particularly since we're below the range and we're 6 months in. But you should not expect us to be updating the range because what happens is you update the range, it eventually moves into a quarterly forecast. Because you give the -- give it for a year, then you give it for the next 9 months, then the next 6 months, then the next thing you know you're doing it for the last quarter. And because it bounces around a lot by quarter, we think the best way to communicate to you all is how are we doing relative to what we expect is the annual range. So -- and we think that's the right way doing it at a calendar year basis. So we're just, Bob is just making a point that we feel pretty good about where we're at. We don't see a lot of adverse trends in frequency or severity when you look at the first 6 months of the year. So we feel good about where we're at in the range. If you just do the math, we'd have to have a pretty good bump to be above the range in the second half here. And we're letting you know, we don't think that's going to happen. But we're also not getting into the process of re-forecasting that range every quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So you're seeing vanilla frequency severity trends here contributing to the potential upside?","Thomas J. Wilson","I think the way in which we do business is contributing to the consistency of the results.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one quick follow-up. On the life side, financial services side, you're going to be discontinuing 20% or 30% of the earnings? Is that what you were saying before the deal closes? What is this sort of core running rate of what's left.","Steven E. Shebik","This is Steve. What we disclosed is roughly about 1\/4 of the earnings is what's earned by the businesses that we are selling. As we go forward -- that will be out of our earnings next year, it will still be earnings for this year until the closing date, which we are hopeful subject to regulatory approval would be the end of the year. I missed out the second part of your question?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Well, what is the core run rate of -- so you're saying 75% of Q2, which was a little bit high, is sort of...","Unknown Executive","Yes, sort of...","Don Civgin","Bob, it's Don. I think what we've disclosed is that a number of about $130 million or so of run rate income is going to leave the company when we complete the transaction.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the ROE levels that you want to pull right now. It seems that on both the homeowners and the auto you're pretty close to where you want to be. And so I'm just curious if I'm looking forward to this year versus this year, what ROE levels are you looking to pull?","Thomas J. Wilson","Vinay, we'll be able to figure that out when we get to next year's outlook, which will be in the fourth quarter when we typically give the -- after fourth quarter results we give next year. So there's a bunch of moving pieces here in terms of what happens to investment income, what happens to the capital structure, where we are in frequency and severity in the last half of the year, how much progress would feel, how much growth there is. So we're not prepared to say what we're going to do next year.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second question is on the pension and life benefits those reductions. You've disclosed the impact, like the net impact on net earnings this year. But just curious as to what's going to be the recurring benefit on a quarterly basis because of lower expenses?","Steven E. Shebik","So this is Steve. We were currently calculating that. We have to do it on the basis of the date we announced the changes July 15. So the actual rate is we haven't had time to really calculate that. What we disclosed was the impact on the balance sheet really and not at a period of time and an estimated range. Not the actual income statement impact, which I don't have a handle on it right now.","Thomas J. Wilson","But it'll be a good number.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And will you guys let it flow to the bottom line? Or are you looking to give it back to the policyholders in the form of lower rates?","Steven E. Shebik","We don't -- as I was saying before, we don't look at everything in terms of reducing price to drive growth. We have a consistent strategy. So as we've said, we want our expense ratio to come down while we're delivering good differentiated value. But as Matt pointed out, they took some -- he took some actions to invest in things like technology and marketing to drive growth. So we don't specifically target individual actions and put them through into a 1-part, portion of the value proposition.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","Could you just review with us kind of what's left in the life insurance financial business that's not part of the core either the -- as I understand, the core business of selling traditional life insurance through the agencies and the work side marketing business. And kind of what is the operating strategy at the moment for those units?","Thomas J. Wilson","Paul, it's Tom. Let me give you an overview, and then Don can talk about specifically that piece. So as you remember, the strategy that we started a couple of years ago when Matt Lutz [ph] was leading that business was to: one, be focused on The Allstate agencies; and two, to be focused on the work site, so you're correct on that. We continue to refine that strategy. And of course Lincoln Benefit is an outcome of -- the natural outcome of that. Don also just recently announced shutting down the fixed annuity business through those agencies. So that's a continued refinement narrows it down a little bit. So it's really life insurance. And from a manufacturing standpoint, it's life insurance to The Allstate agencies. From a providing coverage for our customers, it's everything. We sell variable annuities, we sold that business in 2006 and we're still selling a lot of those. We sell mutual funds, we sell -- we'll sell fixed annuities, we sell long-term care. We sell a whole bunch of things through our agencies. So you have to kind of distinguish between what are we doing for those customers and what are we underwriting. And -- but then also there's about $32 billion block of annuities, which are in several different forms that we still have, still will retain when we get done with the Lincoln Benefit transaction. And Don can talk about what our strategy is there.","Don Civgin","Okay. Paul, it's a -- let me try to answer it this way. When Matt first started with this strategy for the life business, it was a 6% return business. We got that number up to about 8% now, mostly through improvements in operating income. We've still got some elevated capital levels and we're working hard to reduce those as well. I think Tom said it right. You have to view what's left from a customer point of view and then kind of what the liabilities are. From a customer point of view, we're fully committed to meeting the customer value proposition that Allstate has to the Allstate customer through our agency distribution, agencies and exclusive financial specialists. We are going to manufacture life products. We've historically had good returns in that business. We will continue to use our paper to write that product. But on the annuity side, we're basically out of the business as it relates to putting it on our balance sheet. The LBL transaction takes with it about $13 billion of reserves, $9 billion of that is annuities. So that's strategically very important because it continues to reduce our exposure to the spread business. When you look at it from a balance sheet point of view, we have light blocks and we have annuity blocks. As Tom said, the annuity blocks are still larger than we'd like. And we continue to work both on the liability side and the asset side to find ways to make that accretive to our income as opposed to a dilutive, which is what it's doing now. And the life business we want to grow. We like the liabilities there. I think we've had historically good results. We're good at those products but, again, back to the customer point of view, they will not see a difference as to whether it's going on our paper or somebody else's paper.","Thomas J. Wilson","Well, last question please?","Operator","Our follow-up question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It seems like frequency for the last 3 years in auto had been pretty much nonexistent. Any theories on why that is? And what you think is going to happen going forward?","Thomas J. Wilson","Adam, Tom. Matt can talk about it. But I guess I would just characterize it. We wouldn't say it's nonexistent. Perhaps it hasn't been increasing rapidly, but it's still there. But in terms of pressure on loss ratio, Matt can talk about it.","Matthew E. Winter","Yes. I wish it would completely disappear. This business would be easy. But we're actually looking at it and we call it benign. It's stable and it's stable and it's performing within the historical ranges. And so we're not experiencing pressure from the frequency side, but that's on a countrywide basis. And so we have to monitor it on a much more granular basis. We'll continue to look at it on a geography-by-geography basis. In some cases, it may tick up and we'll get on it quickly. But from a countrywide basis, we've seen it stabilize within the historical range.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Adam, this is Tom. On a longer-term basis, of course, you're absolutely right, it's been declining. So whether that's the age of the population, increased sophistication of the car, or the fewer miles driven because of gas prices and the recession, you do see a long-term trend on. We're paying attention to that particularly on that second item with safer cars with machine-to-machine communication, which is why we think our strategy of selling multiple things to the customers is the right way to go. Because if you carry that trend line out, to Matt's point, if you really had no accidents, you wouldn't need much insurance. And so we're seeking to try to protect all our customers from all of life's uncertainties, which is why doing the life insurance piece, having homeowners, doing boat insurance, personal umbrella policies. And in wrapping all of our stuff around that customer so they have kind of a circle of protection is why it's important for us. So you're right, it's been benign. And that's why you see basically very little increase in our average premium. So customers continue to pay a good price -- pay the right price for what the risks they have.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just one quick follow-up. How is that Drive Wise rollout going? And is that helping growth at all? Do you think?","Matthew E. Winter","It's Matt. Thanks for asking. It's going well. We've now rolled out in 20 states as of the end of June. We hope to put on another 8 to 10 through the second half of the year. Very favorable early results. I think I talked a little bit about it on the last call. To date, we have about little over 600 million miles through the system, 20 million hours driven by the customers. We're seeing double-digit growth per month in devices installed in the vehicles. And over 1\/3 of the new customers take Drive Wise when offered in those states where it's available. So the acceptance rate is high, about 70% of the users are receiving a discount. That discount averages around 10% to 12%. So they're taking advantage of it. We're learning from it. The customers are benefiting from it. So it's -- that's a positive story all the way around.","Thomas J. Wilson","And Adam, I would point out too. Remember there's a difference between our strategy and some other people in the business, not everybody, but ours is to stay connected, as Matt talked about. So we're working as opposed to using it for just pricing. Ours is about pricing, but it's also about finding other ways to stay connected with the customers. Thank you, all, for participating. We've made good progress this quarter on strategic initiatives, including our focus on the customer raising returns and homeowners, deploying capital in the right places and enhancing our financial strength. We've also made great progress on the 5 priorities. And we'll keep working hard on your behalf as we go through the rest of the year. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Pat Macellaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick Macellaro","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Yesterday following the close of the market we issued our news release and investor supplement, and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. All of these documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. ","We plan to file our 2015 Form 10-K later this month.

I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.","And now, we'll turn it over Tom Wilson.","Thomas Wilson","Well, good morning. Thank you for investing time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. I'll cover an overview of the results and then Pat and Steve will take you through the details. Our comments today are more detailed on four topics to make sure we provide you with good transparency. I will spend some time discussing our rationale for 2016\u2019s underlying combined ratio outlook, Pat will provide more detail on the auto profitability plan, Steve will discuss the asset liability investment decisions including Allstate's financial \u2013 operating income and the impact that has on operating income. And then Steve is also going to provide some prospective on the overall investment portfolio. That will include both the investments including limited partnerships and energy.","Also in the room today to answer any questions on any and all topics are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, who leads our Emerging Businesses; Judith Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. ","So let's begin on Slide 2. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter that was driven by our repositioned homeowners business, continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan and reducing expenses. The underlying property liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought the full year result to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time.","The recorded combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income. The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claim severities include seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices, making changes to our underwriting standards to slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments that does both of those, and reducing expenses.","This proactive approach however did not offset the impact to the external trend and underwriting profits from our auto insurance declined significantly in 2015. Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating income of $1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year.","And the return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% from the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year through a combination of common share dividends and share repurchases.","If you move to the chart on the bottom of the slide, revenues were up 1.2% for 2015 and property liability premiums grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior year and that reflects a smaller balance sheet, which is due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit in April of 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity business, lower interest income which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio, and a slight decline in income from performance-based investments. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05 per diluted common share. ","If you go to Slide 3, it shows our full year operating results for our four property liability customer segments. So total policy in force growth across all brands was 1.3% in 2015 as you can see at the top and the recorded combined ratio was 94.9. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written and it serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local advice and assistance.","Allstate brand total policies in force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014. Auto insurance, which is on the left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit improvement actions but policy still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at a rate of 1.1% and other personal lines grew by 2.7% compared to 2014.","The underlying combined ratio was a strong 87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015 as you can see in the red box at the bottom. Esurance in the lower right serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Growth was slow throughout2015 in this segment as our focus shifted to profit improvement. Policies in force were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 than the prior year and net written premiums grew by 6.6%.","The underlying loss ratio in Esurance improved by 1.2 points in 2015 and they neared 75.4. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives. Encompassed in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice, but are less concerned about their choice of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015 as policies in force declined by 8.2% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention, which is largely a result of price increases and underwriting changes.","The net written premium decline of 2.8% for 2015 that reflects higher average premiums from increasing rates to improved returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1.1 points better than the prior year. Answer Financial in the upper right that serves brand-new self service customers is essentially an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total non-proprietary written premiums of $581 million in 2015 were 10% higher than the prior year.","So let us go to Slide 4, looking forward to 2016 we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 88 to 90. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that we continued improvement in auto insurance profitability across all three brands given the profit improvement actions we undertook in 2015 and that will continue in 2016.","We do expect modest increases in both auto accident frequency and claim severity, which reflects the broad based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level and as our profit improvements are realized as we start to realize the benefit of the lower combined ratio we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely increase our expense ratio.","As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly changing external environment is difficult. As a result we put a range on our outlook every year. Now what you also know is that we react quickly to trends whether they are positive or negative to adapt our business priorities, so we are building long-term shareholder value.","So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build long-term value and as you can see they are generally the same as 2015. Serving our customers and generating returns on shareholder capital are two top priorities and they are central to our plan. When we do these well we grow insurance policies in force. We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins since new business typically has a higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance volumes in the Allstate brand declined by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of tighter underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices.","While these actions are necessary they are also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts translate into a lower combined ratio. The largest factor in overall growth however is the rate at which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined in the fourth quarter in part reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We are implementing actions to reduce the impact that will have on growth, but what competitors do in their pricing is also a major driver and that is not controllable.","So our 2016 growth plans and prospects vary by customer segment. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend on the timing of the successful implementation of auto profitability action and competitors\u2019 pricing action. The sooner we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business. We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies given the attractive returns on those products.","We expect Esurance and Allstate Benefits to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in policies in force in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we are still committed to growing policy in force across the company but it will be more difficult in 2016 than it has been in the past.","Pat will now go through the property liability results in more detail.","Patrick Macellaro","Thanks Tom. Let's start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2015. The recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9, increased one point versus 2014 driven by an increase in auto losses, which was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, which was 13.7% lower than 2014.","As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014, finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year due primarily to lower performance based investment income.","Property-Liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2% lower than 2014. The chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. The red line representing policy in force growth versus the prior year shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3% given the actions in place across all three underwriting brands to improve auto margins. ","Even with these headwinds, we grew policy counts 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015 as Esurance policy growth slowed and Encompass policies were lower than 2014. These policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015 driven by 11.1% policy growth in Allstate Benefits.","Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written premium trends you see shown by the blue line. The bottom right-hand side of this page shows property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year given our actions to improve auto returns. The underlying property liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 87.4 and was 2.1 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014.","Slide 6 highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate's brand auto. As Tom mentioned earlier, our fourth-quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity as they have been since the fourth quarter of 2014.","Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends to price underwriting and expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was six tenths of a point improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis the underlying combined ratio improved by half a point compared to the third quarter of 2015.","The chart on the top right highlights the trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to show upward momentum as rate increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the quarter a year ago.","Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 given the influence of higher frequency and severity of lower expenses per policy. The gap between these two points remains positive but it is smaller than where it has been historically.","Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left you can see that the favorable impact from low catastrophes that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth quarter resulting in the 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio. Lower frequency of fire claims in the fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio which at 56 was 5 points below the results in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1085 or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Underlying losses per policy decreased 6.6% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in continuing favorable underlying gap between the two trends.","Slide 7 provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. The chart on the top of this page includes fourth-quarter and annual combined ratio results for both companies.","Esurance\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a year ago given decreased investment in marketing, along with a 5 point improvement in the loss ratio, which is reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance\u2019s combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015 improved by 7.4 points compared to 2014.","Encompass\u2019 recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior year quarter and was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter. Encompass\u2019 combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year results in 2014.","The two charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially while net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter a year ago. In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as the 8.2% decline in policy in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions.","As with the Allstate brand we continue to evaluate our results and will adjust profit improvement actions to ensure returns in both of these brands are appropriate. Slide 8 provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto profit improvement plan is comprised of four parts, which we have designed to work together to address the higher loss trends we are experiencing. First, we have sought approval for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we have implemented underwriting changes to slow new business and address specific underperforming segments of business.","Along with underwriting changes we have also increased our ongoing credit classification programs. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence and precision. And fourth, we have reduced expenses across the organization to quickly impact the combined ratio while the other components took hold. These actions in total helped us to finish 2015 within our underlying combined ratio guidance range.","Details to the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of this slide. Approved auto rate increases for all three underlying brands in the fourth quarter of 2015 are worth $401 million in net written premium while the total amount of approved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount of approved auto rate increases in over 10 years.","We also continued to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming segments of business and geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions in conjunction with our credit classification programs and price increases have slowed new business and impacted retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all of these actions are flexible and they are all driven by local market conditions. We will continue to adjust them selectively for market-to-market as auto returns improve.","Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities given cost trends that we and others in the industry are experiencing. Property liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 and was 1.2 points lower than 2014 at year-end reflecting expense actions taken across the company.","You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions included reductions in advertising in the Allstate and Esurance brands, as well as professional services costs and lower compensation incentives across the company.","The bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we have received approval for over the past three years across all three underwriting brands.","The Allstate brand represents the largest component of these rate increases accounting for $942 million of the $1.1 billion for the full year of 2015 and $342 million of $401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Rate and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their insurance with other carriers, not renew their policies, or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate than what is shown on this chart. ","Allstate agency owners and their staff proactively consult with their customers during the insurance review process to arrive at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having a trusted advisor to help guide customers understanding of protection needs during a period of rising auto prices across the industry is a key competitive advantage for us.","This analysis only includes rates approved through December 31st. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a local market-by-market basis and continue to adjust our actions going forward whether it be through price, underwriting, claims excellence or expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns.","And now I will turn it over to Steve, who will cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management.","Steven Shebik","Thanks Pat. Slide 9 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, as highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall we have made good progress and narrowed Allstate Financial's focus and positioned the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition, and repositioned the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities.","Premiums and contract charges in 2015 increased 4.2% when excluding the impact of the 2014 results of Lincoln Benefit Life Company driven by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits' accident and health insurance business as well as a 7.3% increase in traditional life insurance premiums. ","Operating income for 2015 of $509 million was 16.1% lower than 2014 driven primarily by higher life insurance claims, the disposition of LBL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter operating income of $98 million was $30 million below the prior year quarter driven by a lower fixed income yield and a decrease in performance based long-term investment income.","The bottom half of the slide depicts the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The approximately $12 billion of liabilities payout over the next 40 plus years our investment strategy is to match near term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages.","However, for longer-term liabilities we believe equity investments provide the best risk-adjusted returns. As such in the third quarter we sold approximately $2 billion of long duration fixed income securities to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates.","Sale proceeds were invested in shorter duration fixed income and public equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near-term. Over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance based investments that we expect to deliver attractive long-term economic returns although income will be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.","Moving onto Slide 10 and investments. I will start with our portfolio composition at the top of the slide. We have a diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of the portfolio value with $8.6 billion or 15% below investment grade. As we have discussed previously we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to deliver more attractive long-term returns.","We traded capacity for this incremental risk by strengthening our capital position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exposure reduction to catastrophe prone regions and shrinking our annuity business over the past two or three years. ","We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase idiosyncratic risk through performance based investing and selectively increasing our high yield holdings. Our high yield portfolio is conservatively positioned relative to the broader market weighted meaningfully towards BB and to a lesser extent single B issuers.","We have also managed with [Indiscernible] to certain sectors including metals and mining and energy. Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these four approaches we target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. Our market based core by far the largest part of the portfolio delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs.","We seek to outperform the public markets and take advantage of volatility through our market based active strategy. We will be growing allocation through performance based investments, both [long-term] and opportunistic including private equity and real estate partnerships and direct investments.","The majority of our energy holding shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market preferring midstream and higher quality exploration and production players, which we believe are better equipped to withstand the dislocation of energy prices.","With that said this is a dynamic environment, and the implications of the falling energy prices are being felt across the market.","During the fourth quarter, 47 million of the trading loss is 82 million of the recognized impairments related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities. Details of limited partnership holdings in our performance-based long term strategy are shown in the table on the right. Approximately, three quarters of these investments are in private equity including timber and agriculture and one quarter in real-estate, [indiscernible] over the term EMA.","Our performance based long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter, with 2015 being our second highest income year. We received significant cash distributions from realization in this portfolio, which have reduced the amount on distributed income related to our EMA investments.","Moving now to Slide 11. Net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and 3.2 billion for the full-year of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of this slide. In addition to a multi-year shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in light of current economic and market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the property-liability and Allstate Financial portfolios with a belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk in the low yield environment.","To left is property-liability. Reduce our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower yield to the Allstate Financial portfolio. Yield is now increasing reflecting our increased allocation to high yield bonds as well as reinvestment in the higher interest rates are continued shift of the portfolios performance-based long-term investments.","To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. As I covered a bit earlier in talking about the immediate annuity business which reflected in a lower interest bearing yield in 2015.","Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left, is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent or the valuation contribution was negative in 2015, on wider credit spreads across the market, with the majority attributed in our returns to invest in great securities given a weight in our portfolio. In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses.","In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included 470 million of net gains on sales, including the gain and long duration fixed income securities we saw from the Allstate Financial portfolio. Largely offset by impairments and intent write-downs. The impact of lower valuations can be seen in the decrease on our fixed income unrealized gains in the chart to the right.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns common shareholder received out 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015 down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net capital gains in losses on fixed income securities.","Excluding this impact, book value per common share was 4.2% in 2015 versus 2014. We returned 3.3 billion in cash to common shareholders in 2015 to a combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $572 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning of year common shares outstanding.","As of December 31, we have 532 million remaining our current repurchase authorization which we expect to complete by July 2016.","Now, let's open it up to call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the expense side. I appreciate there's a good amount of flexibility there whether it's advertising expenses or slower incentive comp. But I guess in the base case that you highlighted in your guidance that assumes I guess some step-up in severity and frequency. How should we think about the Allstate brand expense ratio?","Thomas Wilson","I'll make an over a comment and Matt might have some perspective as well. First, you should expect the expense ratio to go up because we this year to make our goal, we did cut advertising, I wanted to improve some of the effectiveness to the advertising stuff anyway which move through advertising. And then we took some nice to do technology stuff and differed it and decided not to do it and cut some other expenses. And if you look at it, over the quarters you can see we increasingly reduced our expenses throughout the year which was a focus. That said, there were a number of things we're investing heavily and in one investment in term of either long-term growth or short-term growth, everything from technology I mentioned to things like telematics.","Matthew, you want to add anything to that?","Matthew Winter","I think the only thing I would add Ryan, is that as Tom said in his prepared remarks, as we see the combined ratio in each local geography getting to an appropriate point in our loss ratios, getting where they need to be in the profit improvement actions fully taking hold in rate burning in. We will want to be able to stimulate growth in selected areas as long as we're earning appropriate return and growth requires some investment. And so, part of the expense ratio this year will be influenced by our growth plan and when we're able to turn on growth in certain areas and when we want to invest. We're focused on long-term value creation.","And long-term value creation does require some investment, but it requires investment with appropriate levels of profitability. And so, it's flexible, it will go up, the degree it goes up will depend upon thoughtful analysis of whether or not we add appropriate profitability, appropriate margin, and whether or not we're going to earn an appropriate return on the investment.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is just, I guess in the supplement, you guys a few quarters ago started breaking out gross versus paid frequency. In a way I understand it as you incur the losses based on what the gross frequency is and that's also what I think you guys tend to talk about what the investment community tends to talk about. But the paid frequency number has been running significantly below the gross, over the past several quarters.","I'm just wondering how we should think about that, is there a possibility that you've been over-estimating what frequency is?","Thomas Wilson","Ryan, at first we think our reserves are properly established. So, we do that in a bunch of different ways. We look at both gross and net. We look at what the original amount -- we do it by claims. So, when a claim comes up, we put up some dollar amount toward, then as they adjust -- more they keep building that up and at least to an incurred. And then obviously we think that we have to factor in future upward development in that. So, we look at that as well.","So, we look at paid, incurred, incurred but not reported, and we come up with a number, obviously for things like physical damage claims where they really settled out in about 90 days. That tends to run through pretty quickly. The bottom of the injury where it takes about four years before you get 80% paid out, has a little bit longer trend line on it. And as a result of that longer trend line, you tend to have more process changes along the way because you do things differently every year.","And so, that never tends to bounce around a little more. But I think we're appropriately reserved. I don\u2019t think you should think there was more or less in there then than we thought it. It's the right number.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks. I'll stop there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Thank you, very much. A two question. Tom, the first one's a revisiting last quarter actually. We talked about the 4Q auto acts and seasonality that did not seem to appear this quarter. In the end, is it just a dream or is there something really there or what do you think?","Matthew Winter","Josh, its Matt.","Josh Shanker","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Winter","How are you? I'm going to refer you to a page in the appendix that we put in there. If you look at the presentation slide 14, there is a whole bunch of drivers of the combined ratio and whole bunch of drivers, are these in frequency. Some of them are controllable, some of them are uncontrollable. Some of them we can manage and some we can't. Even within the ones that are somewhat manageable like new business quality and volume of new business and geographic mix, there's also some things that you just can't predict.","Seasonality and weather especially is one of those completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so, when we look at year-over-year, you can look back, we have some charts to show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up and then you have last year where we had almost no catastrophes and benign weather and this year much more normalized catastrophe year but I would say also a more normalized weather environment. Seasonality is one of those high level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have dislocation and abrasions in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis. So, I would not draw trend line conclusions based upon one or two quarters and how they appear versus previous quarters.","Thomas Wilson","And Josh, I don't know if I'm reading into your question but it sounded like frequency was actually up quite a bit in the fourth quarter. So, I couldn't tell what your underlying assumption is. Matt has slide in there as well and the increase in frequency in the fourth quarter.","Josh Shanker","I would -- just look in the past and I have always am anticipating fourth quarter being a tough comp every year. My other question, look I listened to your prepared remarks and I know you are going to invest in the future and home owners can change a little bit, but you did an 88.7% underlying combined ratio firm wide for 2015. And you have a 5.5% rate increases coming through on the auto side, that you've guided to 88% to 90% underlying for 2016. It seems to me a very hard thing to believe that there is world where the underlying combined ratio is going to be worse in 2016 than it was in 2015. Are you just being conservative or I mean do you really think that that's the right range and 89% with a plus or minus one around it?","Thomas Wilson","We think it's the right range. I think we've been doing this since I became CEO. I think it's like it's maybe the ninth or 10th year that I've done this. We've never missed it. So, we do it. So, that we think it's the right range but that's reasonable. You get a point swing either way from frequency and severity. I mean you can get, as Matt mentioned, you can't predict frequency and to be honest it's really difficult to predict severity within a point. So, that alone gives you two points spread. There have been some years, Josh, where we've had a three point spread but that was when we weren't sure how quickly the home owners business is going to take hold and we did quite well.","We got ahead of that and it was faster than we had done in our modeling. But we do a lot of statistical modeling around this. We think it's about right I mean if you are right we will see a lot of rate come through that $1.1 billion. And if loss cost and which is result of frequency and severity keep going up which is what we have in our projections, we'll put more in rate increases. So, no, we think it\u2019s the right number. I am not, we set it up to get there and if you want to assume your case, then that would in the middle of the range. We don't get to a precise, so we do at this tangible point. It's like I like to give just round numbers and we think 88 to 90 will be in that range.","Josh Shanker","All right. Well, good luck and I hope it will be even better than that.","Thomas Wilson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question please.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning and congrats on the trend. Maybe two quick follow-up on Josh's question. First of all, just going back to the discussion on guidance and rate increases, how should we think about future rate increases, you've obviously have meaningful rate increases over the past few quarters. Are you factoring in that based on where we stand, that number to diminish or continue to ramp up from here?","Thomas Wilson","It will be reflective of our results in the cost basis. So, if frequency and severity continue to increase, you'll continue to see us going to individual states with targeted rate increases. If it moderates, and I think we should expect to see it come down but we can't we don't know for sure.","Amit Kumar","So, I guess, related to that is what -- I mean, what are you baking in for frequency and severity here?","Thomas Wilson","We have a plan, obviously, that we have frequency and severity, but when we move to do -- when we got away from EPS guidance, which I thought in our business didn't make a lot of sense. We said, we'll give you an underlying combined ratio guidance which excludes catastrophe. So, things we can pretty much predict, we think at 88 to 90 what happens with increases in frequency and severity, we can manage to it with the premium increases we will be able to get next year.","Amit Kumar","Okay.","Thomas Wilson","We don't give out this specific sub-components. They just ends up being, it helps people do their models but it turns our conversations into one of modeling as opposed to the pace of the business. We feel good about the business where it is, we'd like to make more money in auto insurance even though the returns are above our cost of capital. We've made much higher returns in that at our competitive position and strength enabled us to do that and we are headed down that path. When we get there, we will be dependent what happens with the external environment.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's fair enough. And just like there are some external factors, I know Josh was asking about this. One of the questions you were getting was the benign sort of weather in Q4. If you were to normalize it, would it be materially different what you are looking at in charts I guess 21 and 22 or would it be modestly different?","Thomas Wilson","Well, let me talk about, so the fourth quarter we came in and we were able to get with insight our range. So, at 88, seven, for the year. The good weather really was a result -- wasn't really good weather necessarily. The home owners business feel a little better because we had fewer fire losses, which tend to be big losses. I don't know whether that's weather or just luck. We obviously on the other end of that which is completely controllable as Matt pointed out, is expensive.","We did a good job getting expenses down because we want to be within the range. And then, the profit improvement actions did start to go through, but Matt, maybe lets -- maybe Matt taken to Slide 15 which shows the frequency. Just so because I think everyone saying it's like benign weather and like we had a big increase in our frequency in the fourth quarter and I don't want you to walk away thinking that it wasn't there.","Matthew Winter","Yes. So, Tom referred to Slide 15. What Slide 15 does is show what we believe is one of the primary drivers of frequency as we talked about on almost every call frequency is driven by primarily miles driven but also weather distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting and miles driven itself is driven by employment or even gas prices. We know what's happened to both of those over this last year. One of the confusing things is that I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is wide spread. But I think some of you have taken that to me that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread but it is not consistent across the country, in fact it's geographically varied.","And Slide 15 is just some data from the federal highway administration that shows how miles driven as of November versus prior year has gone up in each of the different regions and you will notice that in the North East it only went up 2.9 while in the West it went up 5.5 and South Atlantic 5.1 etcetera. So, this is one driver but it's a major driver and it does help to explain some of the other questions that you've been raising about why different companies have different experiences. They have different geographic concentrations of their business, books of business, and the miles driven in those areas is different. It will clearly impact results.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Okay. This is very helpful. Thanks for the answers.","Thomas Wilson","Thanks, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Allstate. Just an observation to when you hit your forecast nine years in a row, I guess it's another way of saying you tend to be conservative with your outlooks because no one is that good to be able to forecast. My question --.","Thomas Wilson","And that's your way to say. And Bob, I will say that we have a good system, we have a great team. They are goal driven. They know how to deliver what we said we would deliver. If you had asked me as last year when we gave our range of 87, 89, did I think frequency and severity were in a clip up at above five points, I would have said \"No\". So, the point is you really can't forecast frequency and that what I -- we can do is tell you given the strengthen of our system and the transparency we have our management process is in place, we think we can manage to 88 to 90 next year and so that we've set out to do.","If we do better than that, then that will be because we reacted well and did well but we don't set it up so we can be below it. I guess it's not the goal here because obviously as you would expect, you want to be balanced, thoughtful, and transparent with your shareholders. You don't want to under-promise and over deliver because then everybody will think well the whole world's falling apart, nor do you want to over promise and under deliver. So, we try to do it and what we think the system can delivery and we think 88 to 90. We did not set it up to be too optimistic or set out to be too conserved. It's right down the middle.","Bob Glasspiegel","I hear you. My question is, I understand all your profit moves and am encouraged by the fourth quarter underlined showing some improvement, which suggest that you are on track. I guess I understand what you are doing in Allstate brand and Encompass, on insurance, trying to slow the growth dramatically, certainly fits within your profit objective and it seems like its own way to go to achieve your short-term plan. But I guess my question is are you where you want to be in scale in that business in long-term and what is your overall sort of long-term game play in insurance, how big you have to be in that business to be a long term player?","Thomas Wilson","Let me make an overall long-term comment and then Don can give you some specific. So, insurance is twice the size from when we bought it three years ago. So, and we think it is of scale at a billion six because if you look at normal direct marketing company should be 10% of your premium you would spend on advertising and at a $160 million, that's enough media weight to make sure people hear you. If you're half that size, you don't, you just don't have enough throw weight in the marketing world.","So, I think it's up scaled today. That said, we have good growth plans and I don\u2019t want you to think that this is the backing off of insurance growth. Don can talk about the things we're doing to get into home owners and motorcycles and Canada and new market. So, there is plenty of growth up there. We just were managing this year to some objectives that Don had set with the teams. Don, maybe you want to comment about it?","Don Civgin","Yes, Bob. First remember when we acquired insurance, we did it for the strategic reason of going into the lower right hand corner with the self serve rent sensitive customer and really focusing the customer value proposition against the GEICO and progressive direct model. And when we acquired it, what we said we were going to do is was run it for economics as opposed to GAAP accounting. So, as you know, in the direct model, your expense, all your marketing expense is up front. And as a result, the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you are growing, but then in later years you tend to make money as the business retains and you don't have to spend in the marketing again.","As Tom said, the business is now twice as large as it was when we acquired it a little over four years ago. It does have meaningful impact on where Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth we were having some pressure on the loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency out of our model that meant both on the marketing side and on the operation side. And I would tell you I am absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing.","I mean you talk about slowing it down dramatically. It's still growing 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter and more than that for the year, not as high as it had been, but given the reduction in marketing, still a good growth rate. And the underlying combined ratio is down over eight points from last year in the quarter. So, we feel really good about where they are. Having said that, I would echo what Tom said, the business is at scale. It could run at this size with meaningful growth rates I think and certainly do it in economic way. But we do want to grow the business in the future as aggressively as we can.","We just want to do it with a balanced profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of filter a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now. We feel good about what they're doing. And the one other thing I would amplify is, I think Tom mentioned in his comments, we had four points of investment in 2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year.","Things like expanding home owners which is now in 25 states, renters which is in 20 states, motorcycles in all, auto continues to expand to 43 states and one Ontario in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our capabilities for the future, building out features and expanding our footprint. So, we have -- I think the answer to your questions, we have very aggressive growth plans for the future. We are investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thanks for the thoughtful answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaypaghian from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Daniel Kaypaghian","Good morning, thank you. First question on capital management. And it looks -- [Audio Gap].","Thomas Wilson","So, if we look back over the last couple of years, we set up our share buyback program really in a basis of as you put a capital that we have available. We sold Lincoln Benefit Life which we'd both on capital and also the proceeds from the sale. So, we move that up to the parent company $1.2 billion in 2013 and 2014. So, in 2015 we used a fair amount of backup, increased that buyback program but what may normally had been to a $3 billion level we're talking about.","In addition, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a fair amount of work at kind of bringing our risk profile down in the corporation which once again has freed up some capital. We do need to grow the business at the moment as we said I like that we are going to pool in more money into our investment portfolio to back that into the equity type investment. We will need some to put some money aside, it should grow the business and will also we have to pay our dividend obviously and what we free up essentially from net income, we pay out on a year lag generally in and our share buyback.","Daniel Kaypaghian","Okay. So, we're looking more probably like payout ratio run 100% levels?","Thomas Wilson","Well, we don't do it that way, then of course where the banks do it, but we do it with [indiscernible] which is so we look at how much capital we need, then we say how much do we earn, how much do we have, and so we don't do it as a percentage of earnings.","Daniel Kaypaghian","Okay. It's great. And second question for Tom, it looks the change on Slide 4 of your operating priority seems to be down 16. Two thing, one is the number one is better serve a customer through innovation, in fact, in efficiency. Could you give some example of that and then the [indiscernible] item, basically the long term gross platform now you mentioned about acquiring. I just wonder what platform Allstate current lack that you would like to grow into and what's the [indiscernible] of your acquisition?","Thomas Wilson","Okay. So, let me answer the last one in there, let Matt answer the first one. So, first, in terms of priorities, they are all important. So, they are not like we don't fight over which order they are in. And so Matt will talk about the customer which is obviously very important to us, but as important as all the other ones. We did add, was good catching [indiscernible]. We added the acquired to the bill long-term growth platforms. Long-term growth platforms are [Audio Gap] to acquire something to help accelerate those efforts where we would do that.","Secondly, we believe that there is additional propensity in particularly the Allstate agency channel but also some in insurance to pick up adjacent products and services which are consistent with protecting and preparing people particularly as Matt makes progress on the trusted adviser model in the Allstate agency channel. We think there are other things we could sell in. We could either decide we want to get into the business, do filings, [indiscernible] and that kind of stuff, it's unique. Or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can bolt it onto ours, we would do that. So, that's the concept behind acquisitions. We didn\u2019t put it in there because we have some specific target and I think will not talk about. Matt, you want to go through the customer piece?","Matthew Winter","Sure, Kay. So, you correctly pointed out that its customer base. So, it's all that customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency not just to manage financials and manage margins but to better serve our customers. And there is three primary tracks of work going on under that category. The first is Tom just mentioned just trusted adviser and trusted adviser is all the work we have underway to help our agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialists better serve our customers through personalized customized tailored solutions geographically based, that are advised based, not product push, that are solutions as opposed to transactions and based on long-term value relationships.","And so, we have a lot of work underway there. And that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we put through product. The second major line of work that we have underway, is we refer to it as our continuous improvement, others refer to it as lean engineering. And we have installed continuous improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a set of management principles and practices that empower frontline employees, get them involved in root cause problem solving, create flow of information, creating environment where they are engaged in their work and we have seen dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed continuous improvement.","We've also seen customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas. The third, and this is on really the innovation side the track of work we have underway, we refer to it as integrated digital enterprise but you've also heard me refer to it as a set of projects that take data predictive analytics and emerging technologies and combine those capabilities to better serve customers. And that includes a range of things that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our agency owners in serving their customers to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical product for them might be.","And to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the customer, more intuitive to the customer, and is more respectful of the customers time and energy. And so, you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why the expense ratio may float up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives because they are all about long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation effectiveness and efficiency, we will create a more valuable organization and we are all about that. And so, I thank you for asking the question.","Daniel Kaypaghian","Thank you, very much.","Matthew Winter","Hey, Jonathan, we'll take one more quick one.","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Alison Jacobowitz","It's actually Jay Cowan as you could probably tell by the voice. Two questions. One is, you're obviously taking action as you've talked at length about to improve the auto profitability and you suggested that certainly the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is, what are your competitors doing, what are you seeing out there. And then secondly, relative to miles driven, arguably one of the reasons is lower fuel prices, would you suspect that oil going from 100 down to 40 has a bigger effect than oil going from 40 to 30, in other words the effect one might suggest would be declining over time.","Matthew Winter","Jay, its Matt. Those are two really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing part of our competitors, some of our competitors is a significant rate action in the filings that we're reviewing. As we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant, some of them are more moderate, most of it depends upon if you look back three or four years the level of rates they started this period. And so those who had a greater GAAP to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater rates.","So, we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment and it will certainly generate shopping behavior in the industry and shopping behavior can be a positive or negative depending upon how you approach it, where you positioned and its all part of competition. So, we believe we are well positioned. We believe we are prepared for it. We believe we are monitoring their actions, but we are mostly focused on what we need to do to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so, I would say our primary focus is always on managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing as opposed to trying to react the competitors all the time which I find can just drive you crazy.","On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven. We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas prices because economic activity impacts employment driving and gas prices typically impact only discretionary driving activities because if you have to go to work you have to go to work and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or you're going to pay $1.90 a gallon. If you are thinking about a vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay at home or drive down to Florida, if gases are a $1.60, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at $3.50 a gallon.","Now, there is a point at which though it's just plain cheap and it's no longer a question and I think we're probably at that point. So, I think you are correct in that from what we look at we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas prices has already occurred and it's unlikely that that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like and what all the other influences on frequency will look like.","Thomas Wilson","So, thank you all. I will leave you with a couple of thoughts. Allstate has been extremely strong operating platform. First, that enables us to react quickly to whatever peers in the world. Secondly, we proactively manage our risk and return on a consolidated basis, whether it's catastrophes, auto margins, investment returns or our capital structure; we look at it in total. And thirdly, we are focused on long-term value. We pay attention to current earnings because it is set along the way, but we will not give up long-term value equation [secured to earnings] [ph] because we believe that's what shareholders want which is creating long-term economic cash value.","Thank you very much. We will talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may now disconnect. Good day."]}}
